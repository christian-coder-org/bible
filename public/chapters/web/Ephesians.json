    "Malachi 1:1": "An oracle: the word of Yahweh to Israel by Malachi.",
    "Malachi 1:2": "“I have loved you,” says Yahweh. Yet you say, “How have you loved us?” “Wasn’t Esau Jacob’s brother?” says Yahweh, “Yet I loved Jacob;",
    "Malachi 1:3": "but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and gave his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness.”",
    "Malachi 1:4": "Whereas Edom says, “We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places;” thus says Yahweh of Armies, “They shall build, but I will throw down; and men will call them ‘The Wicked Land,’ even the people against whom Yahweh shows wrath forever.”",
    "Malachi 1:5": "Your eyes will see, and you will say, “Yahweh is great—even beyond the border of Israel!”",
    "Malachi 1:6": "“A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If I am a father, then where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is the respect due me? Says Yahweh of Armies to you, priests, who despise my name. You say, ‘How have we despised your name?’",
    "Malachi 1:7": "You offer polluted bread on my altar. You say, ‘How have we polluted you?’ In that you say, ‘Yahweh’s table contemptible.’",
    "Malachi 1:8": "When you offer the blind for sacrifice, isn’t that evil? And when you offer the lame and sick, isn’t that evil? Present it now to your governor! Will he be pleased with you? Or will he accept your person?” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 1:9": "“Now, please entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us. With this, will he accept any of you?” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 1:10": "“Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might not kindle fire on my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you,” says Yahweh of Armies, “neither will I accept an offering at your hand.",
    "Malachi 1:11": "For from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same, my name is great among the nations, and in every place incense will be offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name is great among the nations,” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 1:12": "“But you profane it, in that you say, ‘Yahweh’s table is polluted, and its fruit, even its food, is contemptible.’",
    "Malachi 1:13": "You say also, ‘Behold, what a weariness it is!’ and you have sniffed at it,” says Yahweh of Armies; “and you have brought that which was taken by violence, the lame, and the sick; thus you bring the offering. Should I accept this at your hand?” says Yahweh.",
    "Malachi 1:14": "“But the deceiver is cursed, who has in his flock a male, and vows, and sacrifices to the Lord a blemished thing; for I am a great King,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and my name is awesome among the nations.”",
    "Malachi 2:1": "“Now, you priests, this commandment is for you.",
    "Malachi 2:2": "If you will not listen, and if you will not lay it to heart, to give glory to my name,” says Yahweh of Armies, “then will I send the curse on you, and I will curse your blessings. Indeed, I have cursed them already, because you do not lay it to heart.",
    "Malachi 2:3": "Behold, I will rebuke your seed, and will spread dung on your faces, even the dung of your feasts; and you will be taken away with it.",
    "Malachi 2:4": "You will know that I have sent this commandment to you, that my covenant may be with Levi,” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 2:5": "“My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him that he might be reverent toward me; and he was reverent toward me, and stood in awe of my name.",
    "Malachi 2:6": "The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity.",
    "Malachi 2:7": "For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 2:8": "But you have turned aside out of the way. You have caused many to stumble in the law. You have corrupted the covenant of Levi,” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 2:9": "“Therefore I have also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according to the way you have not kept my ways, but have had respect for persons in the law.",
    "Malachi 2:10": "Don’t we all have one father? Hasn’t one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?",
    "Malachi 2:11": "Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the holiness of Yahweh which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.",
    "Malachi 2:12": "Yahweh will cut off, to the man who does this, him who wakes and him who answers, out of the tents of Jacob, and him who offers an offering to Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 2:13": "This again you do: you cover the altar of Yahweh with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, because he doesn’t regard the offering any more, neither receives it with good will at your hand.",
    "Malachi 2:14": "Yet you say, ‘Why?’ Because Yahweh has been witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously, though she is your companion, and the wife of your covenant.",
    "Malachi 2:15": "Did he not make you one, although he had the residue of the Spirit? Why one? He sought a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let no one deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.",
    "Malachi 2:16": "For I hate divorce,” says Yahweh, the God of Israel, “and him who covers his garment with violence!” says Yahweh of Armies. “Therefore take heed to your spirit, that you don’t deal treacherously.",
    "Malachi 2:17": "You have wearied Yahweh with your words. Yet you say, ‘How have we wearied him?’ In that you say, ‘Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of Yahweh, and he delights in them;’ or ‘Where is the God of justice?’",
    "Malachi 3:1": "“Behold, I send my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me; and the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, behold, he comes!” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 3:2": "“But who can endure the day of his coming? And who will stand when he appears? For he is like a refiner’s fire, and like launderer’s soap;",
    "Malachi 3:3": "and he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and silver; and they shall offer to Yahweh offerings in righteousness.",
    "Malachi 3:4": "Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasant to Yahweh, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.",
    "Malachi 3:5": "I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against the perjurers, and against those who oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and who deprive the foreigner of justice, and don’t fear me,” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 3:6": "“For I, Yahweh, don’t change; therefore you, sons of Jacob, are not consumed.",
    "Malachi 3:7": "From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from my ordinances, and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you,” says Yahweh of Armies. “But you say, ‘How shall we return?’",
    "Malachi 3:8": "Will a man rob God? Yet you rob me! But you say, ‘How have we robbed you?’ In tithes and offerings.",
    "Malachi 3:9": "You are cursed with the curse; for you rob me, even this whole nation.",
    "Malachi 3:10": "Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house, and test me now in this,” says Yahweh of Armies, “if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough for.",
    "Malachi 3:11": "I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before its time in the field,” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 3:12": "“All nations shall call you blessed, for you will be a delightful land,” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 3:13": "“Your words have been stout against me,” says Yahweh. “Yet you say, ‘What have we spoken against you?’",
    "Malachi 3:14": "You have said, ‘It is vain to serve God;’ and ‘What profit is it that we have followed his instructions, and that we have walked mournfully before Yahweh of Armies?",
    "Malachi 3:15": "Now we call the proud happy; yes, those who work wickedness are built up; yes, they tempt God, and escape.’",
    "Malachi 3:16": "Then those who feared Yahweh spoke one with another; and Yahweh listened, and heard, and a book of memory was written before him, for those who feared Yahweh, and who honored his name.",
    "Malachi 3:17": "They shall be mine,” says Yahweh of Armies, “my own possession in the day that I make, and I will spare them, as a man spares his own son who serves him.",
    "Malachi 3:18": "Then you shall return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him who serves God and him who doesn’t serve him.",
    "Malachi 4:1": "“For, behold, the day comes, it burns as a furnace; and all the proud, and all who work wickedness, will be stubble; and the day that comes will burn them up,” says Yahweh of Armies, “that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.",
    "Malachi 4:2": "But to you who fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings. You will go out, and leap like calves of the stall.",
    "Malachi 4:3": "You shall tread down the wicked; for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I make,” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 4:4": "“Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded to him in Horeb for all Israel, even statutes and ordinances.",
    "Malachi 4:5": "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of Yahweh comes.",
    "Malachi 4:6": "He will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the earth with a curse.”",

    "Mark 6:49": "but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;",
    "Mark 6:50": "for they all saw him, and were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them, and said to them, “Cheer up! It is I! Don’t be afraid.”",
    "Mark 6:51": "He got into the boat with them; and the wind ceased, and they were very amazed among themselves, and marveled;",
    "Mark 6:52": "for they hadn’t understood about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.",
    "Mark 6:53": "When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore.",
    "Mark 6:54": "When they had come out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him,",
    "Mark 6:55": "and ran around that whole region, and began to bring those who were sick, on their mats, to where they heard he was.",
    "Mark 6:56": "Wherever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might touch just the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched him were made well.",
    "Mark 7:1": "Then the Pharisees, and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem.",
    "Mark 7:2": "Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is, unwashed, hands, they found fault.",

    "Mark 7:8": "“For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men—the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things.”",
    "Mark 7:9": "He said to them, “Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.",
    "Mark 7:10": "For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother;’ and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’",
    "Mark 7:11": "But you say, ‘If a man tells his father or his mother, “Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban, that is to say, given to God;”’",
    "Mark 7:12": "then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,",

    "Mark 7:14": "He called all the multitude to himself, and said to them, “Hear me, all of you, and understand.",
    "Mark 7:15": "There is nothing from outside of the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.",
    "Mark 7:16": "If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!”",
    "Mark 7:17": "When he had entered into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable.",
    "Mark 7:18": "He said to them, “Are you thus without understanding also? Don’t you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can’t defile him,",
    "Mark 7:19": "because it doesn’t go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, thus purifying all foods?”",
    "Mark 7:20": "He said, “That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.",
    "Mark 7:21": "For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts,",
    "Mark 7:22": "covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness.",
    "Mark 7:23": "All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.”",
    "Mark 7:24": "From there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house, and didn’t want anyone to know it, but he couldn’t escape notice.",
    "Mark 7:25": "For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.",
    "Mark 7:26": "Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.",
    "Mark 7:27": "But Jesus said to her, “Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”",
    "Mark 7:28": "But she answered him, “Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”",

    "Mark 7:33": "He took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue.",
    "Mark 7:34": "Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, “Ephphatha!” that is, “Be opened!”",
    "Mark 7:35": "Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly.",
    "Mark 7:36": "He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it.",

    "Mark 8:3": "If I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way, for some of them have come a long way.”",
    "Mark 8:4": "His disciples answered him, “From where could one satisfy these people with bread here in a deserted place?”",
    "Mark 8:5": "He asked them, “How many loaves do you have?” They said, “Seven.”",
    "Mark 8:6": "He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground, and he took the seven loaves. Having given thanks, he broke them, and gave them to his disciples to serve, and they served the multitude.",
    "Mark 8:7": "They had a few small fish. Having blessed them, he said to serve these also.",
    "Mark 8:8": "They ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over.",
    "Mark 8:9": "Those who had eaten were about four thousand. Then he sent them away.",
    "Mark 8:10": "Immediately he entered into the boat with his disciples, and came into the region of Dalmanutha.",
    "Mark 8:11": "The Pharisees came out and began to question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, and testing him.",
    "Mark 8:12": "He sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, “Why does this generation seek a sign? Most certainly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation.”",
    "Mark 8:13": "He left them, and again entering into the boat, departed to the other side.",
    "Mark 8:14": "They forgot to take bread; and they didn’t have more than one loaf in the boat with them.",

    "Mark 8:16": "They reasoned with one another, saying, “It’s because we have no bread.”",
    "Mark 8:17": "Jesus, perceiving it, said to them, “Why do you reason that it’s because you have no bread? Don’t you perceive yet, neither understand? Is your heart still hardened?",
    "Mark 8:18": "Having eyes, don’t you see? Having ears, don’t you hear? Don’t you remember?",

    "Mark 8:20": "“When the seven loaves fed the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?” They told him, “Seven.”",
    "Mark 8:21": "He asked them, “Don’t you understand, yet?”",
    "Mark 8:22": "He came to Bethsaida. They brought a blind man to him, and begged him to touch him.",
    "Mark 8:23": "He took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village. When he had spit on his eyes, and laid his hands on him, he asked him if he saw anything.",
    "Mark 8:24": "He looked up, and said, “I see men; for I see them like trees walking.”",
    "Mark 8:25": "Then again he laid his hands on his eyes. He looked intently, and was restored, and saw everyone clearly.",

    "Mark 8:32": "He spoke to them openly. Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.",
    "Mark 8:33": "But he, turning around, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and said, “Get behind me, Satan! For you have in mind not the things of God, but the things of men.”",
    "Mark 8:34": "He called the multitude to himself with his disciples, and said to them, “Whoever wants to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.",
    "Mark 8:35": "For whoever wants to save his life will lose it; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Good News will save it.",
    "Mark 8:36": "For what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life?",
    "Mark 8:37": "For what will a man give in exchange for his life?",
    "Mark 8:38": "For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.”",

    "Mark 9:10": "They kept this saying to themselves, questioning what the “rising from the dead” meant.",
    "Mark 9:11": "They asked him, saying, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”",
    "Mark 9:12": "He said to them, “Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things. How is it written about the Son of Man, that he should suffer many things and be despised?",

    "Mark 9:45": "If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life lame, rather than having your two feet to be cast into Gehenna, into the fire that will never be quenched—",

    "Luke 7:49": "Those who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”",
    "Luke 7:50": "He said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”",
    "Luke 8:1": "It happened soon afterwards, that he went about through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the good news of the Kingdom of God. With him were the twelve,",
    "Luke 8:2": "and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out;",
    "Luke 8:3": "and Joanna, the wife of Chuzas, Herod’s steward; Susanna; and many others; who served them from their possessions.",
    "Luke 8:4": "When a great multitude came together, and people from every city were coming to him, he spoke by a parable.",
    "Luke 8:5": "“The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell along the road, and it was trampled under foot, and the birds of the sky devoured it.",
    "Luke 8:6": "Other seed fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture.",
    "Luke 8:7": "Other fell amid the thorns, and the thorns grew with it, and choked it.",
    "Luke 8:8": "Other fell into the good ground, and grew, and brought forth fruit one hundred times.” As he said these things, he called out, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear!”",
    "Luke 8:9": "Then his disciples asked him, “What does this parable mean?”",
    "Luke 8:10": "He said, “To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables; that ‘seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.’",
    "Luke 8:11": "Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.",
    "Luke 8:12": "Those along the road are those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.",
    "Luke 8:13": "Those on the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root, who believe for a while, then fall away in time of temptation.",
    "Luke 8:14": "That which fell among the thorns, these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity.",
    "Luke 8:15": "That in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it tightly, and bring forth fruit with patience.",
    "Luke 8:16": "“No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a container, or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a stand, that those who enter in may see the light.",
    "Luke 8:17": "For nothing is hidden, that will not be revealed; nor anything secret, that will not be known and come to light.",
    "Luke 8:18": "Be careful therefore how you hear. For whoever has, to him will be given; and whoever doesn’t have, from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has.”",
    "Luke 8:19": "His mother and brothers came to him, and they could not come near him for the crowd.",
    "Luke 8:20": "It was told him by some saying, “Your mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see you.”",
    "Luke 8:21": "But he answered them, “My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God, and do it.”",
    "Luke 8:22": "Now it happened on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples, and he said to them, “Let’s go over to the other side of the lake.” So they launched out.",
    "Luke 8:23": "But as they sailed, he fell asleep. A wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water.",
    "Luke 8:24": "They came to him, and awoke him, saying, “Master, master, we are dying!” He awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it was calm.",
    "Luke 8:25": "He said to them, “Where is your faith?” Being afraid they marveled, saying one to another, “Who is this, then, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?”",
    "Luke 8:26": "They arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.",
    "Luke 8:27": "When Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met him. He wore no clothes, and didn’t live in a house, but in the tombs.",
    "Luke 8:28": "When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, “What do I have to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torment me!”",
    "Luke 8:29": "For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. He was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bands apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert.",
    "Luke 8:30": "Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” He said, “Legion,” for many demons had entered into him.",
    "Luke 8:31": "They begged him that he would not command them to go into the abyss.",
    "Luke 8:32": "Now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those. He allowed them.",
    "Luke 8:33": "The demons came out from the man, and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and were drowned.",
    "Luke 8:34": "When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.",
    "Luke 8:35": "People went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.",
    "Luke 8:36": "Those who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was healed.",
    "Luke 8:37": "All the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very much afraid. He entered into the boat, and returned.",
    "Luke 8:38": "But the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,",
    "Luke 8:39": "“Return to your house, and declare what great things God has done for you.” He went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.",
    "Luke 8:40": "It happened, when Jesus returned, that the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.",
    "Luke 8:41": "Behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus’ feet, and begged him to come into his house,",
    "Luke 8:42": "for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the multitudes pressed against him.",
    "Luke 8:43": "A woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, and could not be healed by any,",
    "Luke 8:44": "came behind him, and touched the fringe of his cloak, and immediately the flow of her blood stopped.",
    "Luke 8:45": "Jesus said, “Who touched me?” When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, “Master, the multitudes press and jostle you, and you say, ‘Who touched me?’”",
    "Luke 8:46": "But Jesus said, “Someone did touch me, for I perceived that power has gone out of me.”",
    "Luke 8:47": "When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.",
    "Luke 8:48": "He said to her, “Daughter, cheer up. Your faith has made you well. Go in peace.”",
    "Luke 8:49": "While he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house came, saying to him, “Your daughter is dead. Don’t trouble the Teacher.”",
    "Luke 8:50": "But Jesus hearing it, answered him, “Don’t be afraid. Only believe, and she will be healed.”",
    "Luke 8:51": "When he came to the house, he didn’t allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, John, James, the father of the child, and her mother.",
    "Luke 8:52": "All were weeping and mourning her, but he said, “Don’t weep. She isn’t dead, but sleeping.”",
    "Luke 8:53": "They were ridiculing him, knowing that she was dead.",
    "Luke 8:54": "But he put them all outside, and taking her by the hand, he called, saying, “Child, arise!”",
    "Luke 8:55": "Her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat.",
    "Luke 8:56": "Her parents were amazed, but he commanded them to tell no one what had been done.",
    "Luke 9:1": "He called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.",
    "Luke 9:2": "He sent them forth to preach the Kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.",
    "Luke 9:3": "He said to them, “Take nothing for your journey—neither staffs, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats apiece.",
    "Luke 9:4": "Into whatever house you enter, stay there, and depart from there.",
    "Luke 9:5": "As many as don’t receive you, when you depart from that city, shake off even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.”",
    "Luke 9:6": "They departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the Good News, and healing everywhere.",
    "Luke 9:7": "Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him; and he was very perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,",
    "Luke 9:8": "and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again.",
    "Luke 9:9": "Herod said, “John I beheaded, but who is this, about whom I hear such things?” He sought to see him.",
    "Luke 9:10": "The apostles, when they had returned, told him what things they had done. He took them, and withdrew apart to a deserted place of a city called Bethsaida.",
    "Luke 9:11": "But the multitudes, perceiving it, followed him. He welcomed them, and spoke to them of the Kingdom of God, and he cured those who needed healing.",
    "Luke 9:12": "The day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said to him, “Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and lodge, and get food, for we are here in a deserted place.”",
    "Luke 9:13": "But he said to them, “You give them something to eat.” They said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we should go and buy food for all these people.”",
    "Luke 9:14": "For they were about five thousand men. He said to his disciples, “Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”",
    "Luke 9:15": "They did so, and made them all sit down.",
    "Luke 9:16": "He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, he blessed them, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude.",
    "Luke 9:17": "They ate, and were all filled. They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over.",
    "Luke 9:18": "It happened, as he was praying alone, that the disciples were with him, and he asked them, “Who do the multitudes say that I am?”",
    "Luke 9:19": "They answered, “‘John the Baptizer,’ but others say, ‘Elijah,’ and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again.”",
    "Luke 9:20": "He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered, “The Christ of God.”",
    "Luke 9:21": "But he warned them, and commanded them to tell this to no one,",
    "Luke 9:22": "saying, “The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.”",
    "Luke 9:23": "He said to all, “If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.",
    "Luke 9:24": "For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life for my sake, the same will save it.",
    "Luke 9:25": "For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits his own self?",
    "Luke 9:26": "For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes in his glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels.",

    "Luke 9:33": "It happened, as they were parting from him, that Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah,” not knowing what he said.",
    "Luke 9:34": "While he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.",
    "Luke 9:35": "A voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!”",
    "Luke 9:36": "When the voice came, Jesus was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.",
    "Luke 9:37": "It happened on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great multitude met him.",
    "Luke 9:38": "Behold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.",
    "Luke 9:39": "Behold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams, and it hardly departs from him, bruising him severely.",
    "Luke 9:40": "I begged your disciples to cast it out, and they couldn’t.”",
    "Luke 9:41": "Jesus answered, “Faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.”",
    "Luke 9:42": "While he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.",
    "Luke 9:43": "They were all astonished at the majesty of God. But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,",
    "Luke 9:44": "“Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men.”",
    "Luke 9:45": "But they didn’t understand this saying. It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.",
    "Luke 9:46": "There arose an argument among them about which of them was the greatest.",
    "Luke 9:47": "Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their hearts, took a little child, and set him by his side,",
    "Luke 9:48": "and said to them, “Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me. Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For whoever is least among you all, this one will be great.”",
    "Luke 9:49": "John answered, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he doesn’t follow with us.”",
    "Luke 9:50": "Jesus said to him, “Don’t forbid him, for he who is not against us is for us.”",
    "Luke 9:51": "It came to pass, when the days were near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem,",
    "Luke 9:52": "and sent messengers before his face. They went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, so as to prepare for him.",
    "Luke 9:53": "They didn’t receive him, because he was traveling with his face set towards Jerusalem.",
    "Luke 9:54": "When his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky, and destroy them, just as Elijah did?”",
    "Luke 9:55": "But he turned and rebuked them, “You don’t know of what kind of spirit you are.",
    "Luke 9:56": "For the Son of Man didn’t come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them.” They went to another village.",
    "Luke 9:57": "As they went on the way, a certain man said to him, “I want to follow you wherever you go, Lord.”",
    "Luke 9:58": "Jesus said to him, “The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”",
    "Luke 9:59": "He said to another, “Follow me!” But he said, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.”",
    "Luke 9:60": "But Jesus said to him, “Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and announce the Kingdom of God.”",
    "Luke 9:61": "Another also said, “I want to follow you, Lord, but first allow me to say good-bye to those who are at my house.”",
    "Luke 9:62": "But Jesus said to him, “No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of God.”",

    "Luke 10:21": "In that same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, “I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.”",
    "Luke 10:22": "Turning to the disciples, he said, “All things have been delivered to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is, except the Father, and who the Father is, except the Son, and he to whomever the Son desires to reveal him.”",
    "Luke 10:23": "Turning to the disciples, he said privately, “Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see,",

    "John 3:1": "Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.",
    "John 3:2": "The same came to him by night, and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do, unless God is with him.”",
    "John 3:3": "Jesus answered him, “Most certainly, I tell you, unless one is born anew, he can’t see the Kingdom of God.”",
    "John 3:4": "Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?”",

    "John 3:14": "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,",
    "John 3:15": "that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.",
    "John 3:16": "For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.",
    "John 3:17": "For God didn’t send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him.",
    "John 3:18": "He who believes in him is not judged. He who doesn’t believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God.",
    "John 3:19": "This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.",
    "John 3:20": "For everyone who does evil hates the light, and doesn’t come to the light, lest his works would be exposed.",
    "John 3:21": "But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they have been done in God.”",
    "John 3:22": "After these things, Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea. He stayed there with them, and baptized.",
    "John 3:23": "John also was baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there. They came, and were baptized.",
    "John 3:24": "For John was not yet thrown into prison.",
    "John 3:25": "There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John’s disciples with some Jews about purification.",
    "John 3:26": "They came to John, and said to him, “Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, the same baptizes, and everyone is coming to him.”",
    "John 3:27": "John answered, “A man can receive nothing, unless it has been given him from heaven.",

    "John 3:29": "He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice. This, my joy, therefore is made full.",
    "John 3:30": "He must increase, but I must decrease.",
    "John 3:31": "He who comes from above is above all. He who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.",
    "John 3:32": "What he has seen and heard, of that he testifies; and no one receives his witness.",
    "John 3:33": "He who has received his witness has set his seal to this, that God is true.",
    "John 3:34": "For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God gives the Spirit without measure.",
    "John 3:35": "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.",
    "John 3:36": "One who believes in the Son has eternal life, but one who disobeys the Son won’t see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.”",
    "John 4:1": "Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John",
    "John 4:2": "(although Jesus himself didn’t baptize, but his disciples),",
    "John 4:3": "he left Judea, and departed into Galilee.",
    "John 4:4": "He needed to pass through Samaria.",
    "John 4:5": "So he came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son, Joseph.",
    "John 4:6": "Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.",
    "John 4:7": "A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give me a drink.”",
    "John 4:8": "For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.",
    "John 4:9": "The Samaritan woman therefore said to him, “How is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)",
    "John 4:10": "Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”",
    "John 4:11": "The woman said to him, “Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. From where then have you that living water?",
    "John 4:12": "Are you greater than our father, Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, as did his children, and his livestock?”",
    "John 4:13": "Jesus answered her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,",
    "John 4:14": "but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst again; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.”",
    "John 4:15": "The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I don’t get thirsty, neither come all the way here to draw.”",
    "John 4:16": "Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come here.”",
    "John 4:17": "The woman answered, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You said well, ‘I have no husband,’",
    "John 4:18": "for you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband. This you have said truly.”",
    "John 4:19": "The woman said to him, “Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.",
    "John 4:20": "Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.”",
    "John 4:21": "Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Father.",
    "John 4:22": "You worship that which you don’t know. We worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.",
    "John 4:23": "But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such to be his worshippers.",
    "John 4:24": "God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”",
    "John 4:25": "The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah comes,” (he who is called Christ). “When he has come, he will declare to us all things.”",
    "John 4:26": "Jesus said to her, “I am he, the one who speaks to you.”",
    "John 4:27": "At this, his disciples came. They marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, “What are you looking for?” or, “Why do you speak with her?”",
    "John 4:28": "So the woman left her water pot, and went away into the city, and said to the people,",
    "John 4:29": "“Come, see a man who told me everything that I did. Can this be the Christ?”",
    "John 4:30": "They went out of the city, and were coming to him.",
    "John 4:31": "In the meanwhile, the disciples urged him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.”",
    "John 4:32": "But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you don’t know about.”",
    "John 4:33": "The disciples therefore said one to another, “Has anyone brought him something to eat?”",
    "John 4:34": "Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work.",
    "John 4:35": "Don’t you say, ‘There are yet four months until the harvest?’ Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already.",
    "John 4:36": "He who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life; that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.",
    "John 4:37": "For in this the saying is true, ‘One sows, and another reaps.’",
    "John 4:38": "I sent you to reap that for which you haven’t labored. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.”",
    "John 4:39": "From that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman, who testified, “He told me everything that I did.”",
    "John 4:40": "So when the Samaritans came to him, they begged him to stay with them. He stayed there two days.",
    "John 4:41": "Many more believed because of his word.",
    "John 4:42": "They said to the woman, “Now we believe, not because of your speaking; for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.”",
    "John 4:43": "After the two days he went out from there and went into Galilee.",
    "John 4:44": "For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.",
    "John 4:45": "So when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast.",
    "John 4:46": "Jesus came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water into wine. There was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.",
    "John 4:47": "When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and begged him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.",
    "John 4:48": "Jesus therefore said to him, “Unless you see signs and wonders, you will in no way believe.”",
    "John 4:49": "The nobleman said to him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.”",
    "John 4:50": "Jesus said to him, “Go your way. Your son lives.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way.",
    "John 4:51": "As he was now going down, his servants met him and reported, saying “Your child lives!”",
    "John 4:52": "So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. They said therefore to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour, the fever left him.”",
    "John 4:53": "So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him, “Your son lives.” He believed, as did his whole house.",
    "John 4:54": "This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.",
    "John 5:1": "After these things, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.",
    "John 5:2": "Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, there is a pool, which is called in Hebrew, “Bethesda,” having five porches.",
    "John 5:3": "In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water;",
    "John 5:4": "for an angel went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred up the water. Whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had.",
    "John 5:5": "A certain man was there, who had been sick for thirty-eight years.",
    "John 5:6": "When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he asked him, “Do you want to be made well?”",
    "John 5:7": "The sick man answered him, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I’m coming, another steps down before me.”",
    "John 5:8": "Jesus said to him, “Arise, take up your mat, and walk.”",
    "John 5:9": "Immediately, the man was made well, and took up his mat and walked. Now it was the Sabbath on that day.",
    "John 5:10": "So the Jews said to him who was cured, “It is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry the mat.”",
    "John 5:11": "He answered them, “He who made me well, the same said to me, ‘Take up your mat, and walk.’”",
    "John 5:12": "Then they asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Take up your mat, and walk’?”",
    "John 5:13": "But he who was healed didn’t know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a crowd being in the place.",
    "John 5:14": "Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, “Behold, you are made well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse happens to you.”",
    "John 5:15": "The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.",
    "John 5:16": "For this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these things on the Sabbath.",
    "John 5:17": "But Jesus answered them, “My Father is still working, so I am working, too.”",
    "John 5:18": "For this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.",
    "John 5:19": "Jesus therefore answered them, “Most certainly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father doing. For whatever things he does, these the Son also does likewise.",
    "John 5:20": "For the Father has affection for the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. He will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.",
    "John 5:21": "For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires.",
    "John 5:22": "For the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son,",
    "John 5:23": "that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who doesn’t honor the Son doesn’t honor the Father who sent him.",
    "John 5:24": "“Most certainly I tell you, he who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and doesn’t come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.",
    "John 5:25": "Most certainly, I tell you, the hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the Son of God’s voice; and those who hear will live.",
    "John 5:26": "For as the Father has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself.",
    "John 5:27": "He also gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man.",
    "John 5:28": "Don’t marvel at this, for the hour comes, in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice,",
    "John 5:29": "and will come out; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.",
    "John 5:30": "I can of myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous; because I don’t seek my own will, but the will of my Father who sent me.",
    "John 5:31": "“If I testify about myself, my witness is not valid.",
    "John 5:32": "It is another who testifies about me. I know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true.",
    "John 5:33": "You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.",
    "John 5:34": "But the testimony which I receive is not from man. However, I say these things that you may be saved.",
    "John 5:35": "He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.",
    "John 5:36": "But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John, for the works which the Father gave me to accomplish, the very works that I do, testify about me, that the Father has sent me.",
    "John 5:37": "The Father himself, who sent me, has testified about me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.",
    "John 5:38": "You don’t have his word living in you; because you don’t believe him whom he sent.",
    "John 5:39": "“You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and these are they which testify about me.",
    "John 5:40": "Yet you will not come to me, that you may have life.",

    "John 5:42": "But I know you, that you don’t have God’s love in yourselves.",
    "John 5:43": "I have come in my Father’s name, and you don’t receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him.",
    "John 5:44": "How can you believe, who receive glory from one another, and you don’t seek the glory that comes from the only God?",
    "John 5:45": "“Don’t think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you, even Moses, on whom you have set your hope.",
    "John 5:46": "For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote about me.",
    "John 5:47": "But if you don’t believe his writings, how will you believe my words?”",
    "John 6:1": "After these things, Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is also called the Sea of Tiberias.",

    "John 6:4": "Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.",
    "John 6:5": "Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude was coming to him, said to Philip, “Where are we to buy bread, that these may eat?”",
    "John 6:6": "This he said to test him, for he himself knew what he would do.",
    "John 6:7": "Philip answered him, “Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that everyone of them may receive a little.”",
    "John 6:8": "One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to him,",
    "John 6:9": "“There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are these among so many?”",
    "John 6:10": "Jesus said, “Have the people sit down.” Now there was much grass in that place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.",
    "John 6:11": "Jesus took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were sitting down; likewise also of the fish as much as they desired.",
    "John 6:12": "When they were filled, he said to his disciples, “Gather up the broken pieces which are left over, that nothing be lost.”",
    "John 6:13": "So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which were left over by those who had eaten.",
    "John 6:14": "When therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did, they said, “This is truly the prophet who comes into the world.”",

    "John 6:16": "When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,",
    "John 6:17": "and they entered into the boat, and were going over the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.",
    "John 6:18": "The sea was tossed by a great wind blowing.",
    "John 6:19": "When therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the boat; and they were afraid.",
    "John 6:20": "But he said to them, “It is I. Don’t be afraid.”",
    "John 6:21": "They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat. Immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.",
    "John 6:22": "On the next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except the one in which his disciples had embarked, and that Jesus hadn’t entered with his disciples into the boat, but his disciples had gone away alone.",
    "John 6:23": "However boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.",
    "John 6:24": "When the multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn’t there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.",
    "John 6:25": "When they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you come here?”",
    "John 6:26": "Jesus answered them, “Most certainly I tell you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves, and were filled.",
    "John 6:27": "Don’t work for the food which perishes, but for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For God the Father has sealed him.”",
    "John 6:28": "They said therefore to him, “What must we do, that we may work the works of God?”",

    "John 6:34": "They said therefore to him, “Lord, always give us this bread.”",
    "John 6:35": "Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty.",

    "John 6:44": "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day.",
    "John 6:45": "It is written in the prophets, ‘They will all be taught by God.’ Therefore everyone who hears from the Father, and has learned, comes to me.",
    "John 6:46": "Not that anyone has seen the Father, except he who is from God. He has seen the Father.",

    "John 6:58": "This is the bread which came down out of heaven—not as our fathers ate the manna, and died. He who eats this bread will live forever.”",
    "John 6:59": "He said these things in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.",
    "John 6:60": "Therefore many of his disciples, when they heard this, said, “This is a hard saying! Who can listen to it?”",
    "John 6:61": "But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them, “Does this cause you to stumble?",
    "John 6:62": "Then what if you would see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?",

    "John 7:1": "After these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he wouldn’t walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.",
    "John 7:2": "Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand.",
    "John 7:3": "His brothers therefore said to him, “Depart from here, and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do.",
    "John 7:4": "For no one does anything in secret, and himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world.”",
    "John 7:5": "For even his brothers didn’t believe in him.",
    "John 7:6": "Jesus therefore said to them, “My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.",

    "John 7:13": "Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.",
    "John 7:14": "But when it was now the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.",
    "John 7:15": "The Jews therefore marveled, saying, “How does this man know letters, having never been educated?”",
    "John 7:16": "Jesus therefore answered them, “My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.",
    "John 7:17": "If anyone desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from God, or if I am speaking from myself.",
    "John 7:18": "He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.",
    "John 7:19": "Didn’t Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?”",
    "John 7:20": "The multitude answered, “You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?”",
    "John 7:21": "Jesus answered them, “I did one work, and you all marvel because of it.",
    "John 7:22": "Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy.",
    "John 7:23": "If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath?",

    "John 7:25": "Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, “Isn’t this he whom they seek to kill?",
    "John 7:26": "Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ?",
    "John 7:27": "However we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.”",
    "John 7:28": "Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, “You both know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you don’t know.",
    "John 7:29": "I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me.”",
    "John 7:30": "They sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.",

    "John 7:41": "Others said, “This is the Christ.” But some said, “What, does the Christ come out of Galilee?",
    "John 7:42": "Hasn’t the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?”",

    "Romans 2:1": "Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are who judge. For in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you who judge practice the same things.",
    "Romans 2:2": "We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things.",
    "Romans 2:3": "Do you think this, O man who judges those who practice such things, and do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?",
    "Romans 2:4": "Or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?",
    "Romans 2:5": "But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath, revelation, and of the righteous judgment of God;",
    "Romans 2:6": "who “will pay back to everyone according to their works:”",
    "Romans 2:7": "to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory, honor, and incorruptibility, eternal life;",
    "Romans 2:8": "but to those who are self-seeking, and don’t obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath and indignation,",
    "Romans 2:9": "oppression and anguish, on every soul of man who works evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.",
    "Romans 2:10": "But glory, honor, and peace go to every man who works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.",
    "Romans 2:11": "For there is no partiality with God.",
    "Romans 2:12": "For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without the law. As many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.",
    "Romans 2:13": "For it isn’t the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified",
    "Romans 2:14": "(for when Gentiles who don’t have the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are a law to themselves,",
    "Romans 2:15": "in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying with them, and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them)",
    "Romans 2:16": "in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my Good News, by Jesus Christ.",
    "Romans 2:17": "Indeed you bear the name of a Jew, and rest on the law, and glory in God,",
    "Romans 2:18": "and know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,",
    "Romans 2:19": "and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,",
    "Romans 2:20": "a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth.",
    "Romans 2:21": "You therefore who teach another, don’t you teach yourself? You who preach that a man shouldn’t steal, do you steal?",
    "Romans 2:22": "You who say a man shouldn’t commit adultery. Do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?",
    "Romans 2:23": "You who glory in the law, through your disobedience of the law do you dishonor God?",
    "Romans 2:24": "For “the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,” just as it is written.",
    "Romans 2:25": "For circumcision indeed profits, if you are a doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.",
    "Romans 2:26": "If therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law, won’t his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision?",
    "Romans 2:27": "Won’t the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law?",
    "Romans 2:28": "For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh;",
    "Romans 2:29": "but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.",
    "Romans 3:1": "Then what advantage does the Jew have? Or what is the profit of circumcision?",
    "Romans 3:2": "Much in every way! Because first of all, they were entrusted with the oracles of God.",
    "Romans 3:3": "For what if some were without faith? Will their lack of faith nullify the faithfulness of God?",
    "Romans 3:4": "May it never be! Yes, let God be found true, but every man a liar. As it is written, “That you might be justified in your words, and might prevail when you come into judgment.”",
    "Romans 3:5": "But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what will we say? Is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath? I speak like men do.",
    "Romans 3:6": "May it never be! For then how will God judge the world?",
    "Romans 3:7": "For if the truth of God through my lie abounded to his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?",
    "Romans 3:8": "Why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), “Let us do evil, that good may come?” Those who say so are justly condemned.",
    "Romans 3:9": "What then? Are we better than they? No, in no way. For we previously warned both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin.",
    "Romans 3:10": "As it is written, “There is no one righteous; no, not one.",
    "Romans 3:11": "There is no one who understands. There is no one who seeks after God.",
    "Romans 3:12": "They have all turned aside. They have together become unprofitable. There is no one who does good, no, not, so much as one.”",
    "Romans 3:13": "“Their throat is an open tomb. With their tongues they have used deceit.” “The poison of vipers is under their lips;”",

    "Romans 3:17": "The way of peace, they haven’t known.”",
    "Romans 3:18": "“There is no fear of God before their eyes.”",
    "Romans 3:19": "Now we know that whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be closed, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God.",
    "Romans 3:20": "Because by the works of the law, no flesh will be justified in his sight. For through the law comes the knowledge of sin.",
    "Romans 3:21": "But now apart from the law, a righteousness of God has been revealed, being testified by the law and the prophets;",
    "Romans 3:22": "even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all those who believe. For there is no distinction,",
    "Romans 3:23": "for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;",
    "Romans 3:24": "being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus;",
    "Romans 3:25": "whom God set forth to be an atoning sacrifice, through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness through the passing over of prior sins, in God’s forbearance;",
    "Romans 3:26": "to demonstrate his righteousness at this present time; that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus.",
    "Romans 3:27": "Where then is the boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith.",
    "Romans 3:28": "We maintain therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.",
    "Romans 3:29": "Or is God the God of Jews only? Isn’t he the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,",
    "Romans 3:30": "since indeed there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith, and the uncircumcised through faith.",
    "Romans 3:31": "Do we then nullify the law through faith? May it never be! No, we establish the law.",
    "Romans 4:1": "What then will we say that Abraham, our forefather, has found according to the flesh?",
    "Romans 4:2": "For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not toward God.",
    "Romans 4:3": "For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.”",
    "Romans 4:4": "Now to him who works, the reward is not counted as grace, but as something owed.",
    "Romans 4:5": "But to him who doesn’t work, but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness.",
    "Romans 4:6": "Even as David also pronounces blessing on the man to whom God counts righteousness apart from works,",
    "Romans 4:7": "“Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sins are covered.",
    "Romans 4:8": "Blessed is the man whom the Lord will by no means charge with sin.”",
    "Romans 4:9": "Is this blessing then pronounced on the circumcised, or on the uncircumcised also? For we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for righteousness.",
    "Romans 4:10": "How then was it counted? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.",
    "Romans 4:11": "He received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision, that he might be the father of all those who believe, though they might be in uncircumcision, that righteousness might also be accounted to them.",
    "Romans 4:12": "He is the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had in uncircumcision.",
    "Romans 4:13": "For the promise to Abraham and to his seed that he should be heir of the world wasn’t through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.",
    "Romans 4:14": "For if those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of no effect.",
    "Romans 4:15": "For the law works wrath, for where there is no law, neither is there disobedience.",
    "Romans 4:16": "For this cause it is of faith, that it may be according to grace, to the end that the promise may be sure to all the seed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.",
    "Romans 4:17": "As it is written, “I have made you a father of many nations.” This is in the presence of him whom he believed: God, who gives life to the dead, and calls the things that are not, as though they were.",
    "Romans 4:18": "Who in hope believed against hope, to the end that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, “So will your seed be.”",
    "Romans 4:19": "Without being weakened in faith, he didn’t consider his own body, already having been worn out, (he being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah’s womb.",
    "Romans 4:20": "Yet, looking to the promise of God, he didn’t waver through unbelief, but grew strong through faith, giving glory to God,",
    "Romans 4:21": "and being fully assured that what he had promised, he was also able to perform.",
    "Romans 4:22": "Therefore it also was “reckoned to him for righteousness.”",
    "Romans 4:23": "Now it was not written that it was accounted to him for his sake alone,",
    "Romans 4:24": "but for our sake also, to whom it will be accounted, who believe in him who raised Jesus, our Lord, from the dead,",
    "Romans 4:25": "who was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification.",
    "Romans 5:1": "Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;",
    "Romans 5:2": "through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand. We rejoice in hope of the glory of God.",
    "Romans 5:3": "Not only this, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering works perseverance;",
    "Romans 5:4": "and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope:",
    "Romans 5:5": "and hope doesn’t disappoint us, because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.",
    "Romans 5:6": "For while we were yet weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.",
    "Romans 5:7": "For one will hardly die for a righteous man. Yet perhaps for a righteous person someone would even dare to die.",
    "Romans 5:8": "But God commends his own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.",
    "Romans 5:9": "Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we will be saved from God’s wrath through him.",
    "Romans 5:10": "For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we will be saved by his life.",
    "Romans 5:11": "Not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.",
    "Romans 5:12": "Therefore, as sin entered into the world through one man, and death through sin; and so death passed to all men, because all sinned.",
    "Romans 5:13": "For until the law, sin was in the world; but sin is not charged when there is no law.",
    "Romans 5:14": "Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those whose sins weren’t like Adam’s disobedience, who is a foreshadowing of him who was to come.",
    "Romans 5:15": "But the free gift isn’t like the trespass. For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many.",
    "Romans 5:16": "The gift is not as through one who sinned: for the judgment came by one to condemnation, but the free gift came of many trespasses to justification.",
    "Romans 5:17": "For if by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one; so much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ.",
    "Romans 5:18": "So then as through one trespass, all men were condemned; even so through one act of righteousness, all men were justified to life.",
    "Romans 5:19": "For as through the one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one, many will be made righteous.",
    "Romans 5:20": "The law came in besides, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace abounded more exceedingly;",
    "Romans 5:21": "that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.",
    "Romans 6:1": "What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?",
    "Romans 6:2": "May it never be! We who died to sin, how could we live in it any longer?",
    "Romans 6:3": "Or don’t you know that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?",
    "Romans 6:4": "We were buried therefore with him through baptism to death, that just like Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life.",
    "Romans 6:5": "For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we will also be part of his resurrection;",
    "Romans 6:6": "knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be in bondage to sin.",
    "Romans 6:7": "For he who has died has been freed from sin.",
    "Romans 6:8": "But if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him;",
    "Romans 6:9": "knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no more has dominion over him!",
    "Romans 6:10": "For the death that he died, he died to sin one time; but the life that he lives, he lives to God.",
    "Romans 6:11": "Thus consider yourselves also to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.",
    "Romans 6:12": "Therefore don’t let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.",
    "Romans 6:13": "Neither present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God, as alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.",
    "Romans 6:14": "For sin will not have dominion over you. For you are not under law, but under grace.",
    "Romans 6:15": "What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? May it never be!",
    "Romans 6:16": "Don’t you know that to whom you present yourselves as servants to obedience, his servants you are whom you obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?",
    "Romans 6:17": "But thanks be to God, that, whereas you were bondservants of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto you were delivered.",
    "Romans 6:18": "Being made free from sin, you became bondservants of righteousness.",
    "Romans 6:19": "I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh, for as you presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to wickedness upon wickedness, even so now present your members as servants to righteousness for sanctification.",
    "Romans 6:20": "For when you were servants of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.",
    "Romans 6:21": "What fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.",
    "Romans 6:22": "But now, being made free from sin, and having become servants of God, you have your fruit of sanctification, and the result of eternal life.",
    "Romans 6:23": "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.",
    "Romans 7:1": "Or don’t you know, brothers (for I speak to men who know the law), that the law has dominion over a man for as long as he lives?",
    "Romans 7:2": "For the woman that has a husband is bound by law to the husband while he lives, but if the husband dies, she is discharged from the law of the husband.",
    "Romans 7:3": "So then if, while the husband lives, she is joined to another man, she would be called an adulteress. But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she is joined to another man.",
    "Romans 7:4": "Therefore, my brothers, you also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you would be joined to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit to God.",
    "Romans 7:5": "For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were through the law, worked in our members to bring forth fruit to death.",
    "Romans 7:6": "But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.",
    "Romans 7:7": "What shall we say then? Is the law sin? May it never be! However, I wouldn’t have known sin, except through the law. For I wouldn’t have known coveting, unless the law had said, “You shall not covet.”",
    "Romans 7:8": "But sin, finding occasion through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of coveting. For apart from the law, sin is dead.",
    "Romans 7:9": "I was alive apart from the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.",
    "Romans 7:10": "The commandment, which was for life, this I found to be for death;",
    "Romans 7:11": "for sin, finding occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me.",
    "Romans 7:12": "Therefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good.",
    "Romans 7:13": "Did then that which is good become death to me? May it never be! But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, by working death to me through that which is good; that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful.",
    "Romans 7:14": "For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, sold under sin.",
    "Romans 7:15": "For I don’t know what I am doing. For I don’t practice what I desire to do; but what I hate, that I do.",
    "Romans 7:16": "But if what I don’t desire, that I do, I consent to the law that it is good.",
    "Romans 7:17": "So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me.",
    "Romans 7:18": "For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing. For desire is present with me, but I don’t find it doing that which is good.",
    "Romans 7:19": "For the good which I desire, I don’t do; but the evil which I don’t desire, that I practice.",
    "Romans 7:20": "But if what I don’t desire, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me.",
    "Romans 7:21": "I find then the law, that, to me, while I desire to do good, evil is present.",
    "Romans 7:22": "For I delight in God’s law after the inward man,",
    "Romans 7:23": "but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members.",
    "Romans 7:24": "What a wretched man I am! Who will deliver me out of the body of this death?",
    "Romans 7:25": "I thank God through Jesus Christ, our Lord! So then with the mind, I myself serve God’s law, but with the flesh, the sin’s law.",
    "Romans 8:1": "There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who don’t walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.",
    "Romans 8:2": "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death.",
    "Romans 8:3": "For what the law couldn’t do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God did, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh;",
    "Romans 8:4": "that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.",
    "Romans 8:5": "For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.",
    "Romans 8:6": "For the mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace;",
    "Romans 8:7": "because the mind of the flesh is hostile towards God; for it is not subject to God’s law, neither indeed can it be.",
    "Romans 8:8": "Those who are in the flesh can’t please God.",
    "Romans 8:9": "But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if it is so that the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if any man doesn’t have the Spirit of Christ, he is not his.",
    "Romans 8:10": "If Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is alive because of righteousness.",
    "Romans 8:11": "But if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.",
    "Romans 8:12": "So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.",
    "Romans 8:13": "For if you live after the flesh, you must die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.",
    "Romans 8:14": "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are children of God.",
    "Romans 8:15": "For you didn’t receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, “Abba! Father!”",
    "Romans 8:16": "The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God;",
    "Romans 8:17": "and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ; if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him.",
    "Romans 8:18": "For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be revealed toward us.",
    "Romans 8:19": "For the creation waits with eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed.",
    "Romans 8:20": "For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but because of him who subjected it, in hope",
    "Romans 8:21": "that the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of decay into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.",
    "Romans 8:22": "For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.",
    "Romans 8:23": "Not only so, but ourselves also, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for adoption, the redemption of our body.",
    "Romans 8:24": "For we were saved in hope, but hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for that which he sees?",
    "Romans 8:25": "But if we hope for that which we don’t see, we wait for it with patience.",
    "Romans 8:26": "In the same way, the Spirit also helps our weaknesses, for we don’t know how to pray as we ought. But the Spirit himself makes intercession for us with groanings which can’t be uttered.",
    "Romans 8:27": "He who searches the hearts knows what is on the Spirit’s mind, because he makes intercession for the saints according to God.",
    "Romans 8:28": "We know that all things work together for good for those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose.",
    "Romans 8:29": "For whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.",
    "Romans 8:30": "Whom he predestined, those he also called. Whom he called, those he also justified. Whom he justified, those he also glorified.",
    "Romans 8:31": "What then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?",
    "Romans 8:32": "He who didn’t spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how would he not also with him freely give us all things?",
    "Romans 8:33": "Who could bring a charge against God’s chosen ones? It is God who justifies.",
    "Romans 8:34": "Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, yes rather, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.",
    "Romans 8:35": "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Could oppression, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?",
    "Romans 8:36": "Even as it is written, “For your sake we are killed all day long. We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter.”",
    "Romans 8:37": "No, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.",
    "Romans 8:38": "For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,",
    "Romans 8:39": "nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.",
    "Romans 9:1": "I tell the truth in Christ. I am not lying, my conscience testifying with me in the Holy Spirit,",
    "Romans 9:2": "that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.",
    "Romans 9:3": "For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers’ sake, my relatives according to the flesh,",
    "Romans 9:4": "who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service, and the promises;",
    "Romans 9:5": "of whom are the fathers, and from whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God, blessed forever. Amen.",
    "Romans 9:6": "But it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing. For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel.",
    "Romans 9:7": "Neither, because they are Abraham’s seed, are they all children. But, “In Isaac will your seed be called.”",
    "Romans 9:8": "That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as a seed.",

    "Romans 9:18": "So then, he has mercy on whom he desires, and he hardens whom he desires.",
    "Romans 9:19": "You will say then to me, “Why does he still find fault? For who withstands his will?”",
    "Romans 9:20": "But indeed, O man, who are you to reply against God? Will the thing formed ask him who formed it, “Why did you make me like this?”",
    "Romans 9:21": "Or hasn’t the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel for honor, and another for dishonor?",

    "Romans 9:31": "but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, didn’t arrive at the law of righteousness.",
    "Romans 9:32": "Why? Because they didn’t seek it by faith, but as it were by works of the law. They stumbled over the stumbling stone;",

    "Romans 10:10": "For with the heart, one believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.",
    "Romans 10:11": "For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed.”",
    "Romans 10:12": "For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, and is rich to all who call on him.",
    "Romans 10:13": "For, “Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.”",

    "Romans 11:12": "Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?",
    "Romans 11:13": "For I speak to you who are Gentiles. Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;",
    "Romans 11:14": "if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them.",

    "Romans 11:17": "But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them, and became partaker with them of the root and of the richness of the olive tree;",
    "Romans 11:18": "don’t boast over the branches. But if you boast, it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you.",

    "Romans 11:23": "They also, if they don’t continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.",
    "Romans 11:24": "For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?",
    "Romans 11:25": "For I don’t desire you to be ignorant, brothers, of this mystery, so that you won’t be wise in your own conceits, that a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in,",
    "Romans 11:26": "and so all Israel will be saved. Even as it is written, “There will come out of Zion the Deliverer, and he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.",

    "Romans 14:23": "But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because it isn’t of faith; and whatever is not of faith is sin. (14:24) Now to him who is able to establish you according to my Good News and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret through long ages, (14:25) but now is revealed, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, is made known for obedience of faith to all the nations; (14:26) to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever!

    "1 Corinthians 1:1": "Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,",
    "1 Corinthians 1:2": "to the assembly of God which is at Corinth; those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, both theirs and ours:",
    "1 Corinthians 1:3": "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:4": "I always thank my God concerning you, for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus;",
    "1 Corinthians 1:5": "that in everything you were enriched in him, in all speech and all knowledge;",
    "1 Corinthians 1:6": "even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:",
    "1 Corinthians 1:7": "so that you come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;",
    "1 Corinthians 1:8": "who will also confirm you until the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:9": "God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:10": "Now I beg you, brothers, through the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:11": "For it has been reported to me concerning you, my brothers, by those who are from Chloe’s household, that there are contentions among you.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:12": "Now I mean this, that each one of you says, “I follow Paul,” “I follow Apollos,” “I follow Cephas,” and, “I follow Christ.”",
    "1 Corinthians 1:13": "Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?",
    "1 Corinthians 1:14": "I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius,",
    "1 Corinthians 1:15": "so that no one should say that I had baptized you into my own name.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:16": "(I also baptized the household of Stephanas; besides them, I don’t know whether I baptized any other.)",
    "1 Corinthians 1:17": "For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Good News—not in wisdom of words, so that the cross of Christ wouldn’t be made void.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:18": "For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying, but to us who are saved it is the power of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:19": "For it is written, “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing.”",
    "1 Corinthians 1:20": "Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the lawyer of this world? Hasn’t God made foolish the wisdom of this world?",
    "1 Corinthians 1:21": "For seeing that in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom didn’t know God, it was God’s good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:22": "For Jews ask for signs, Greeks seek after wisdom,",
    "1 Corinthians 1:23": "but we preach Christ crucified; a stumbling block to Jews, and foolishness to Greeks,",
    "1 Corinthians 1:24": "but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:25": "Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:26": "For you see your calling, brothers, that not many are wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, and not many noble;",
    "1 Corinthians 1:27": "but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise. God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;",
    "1 Corinthians 1:28": "and God chose the lowly things of the world, and the things that are despised, and the things that are not, that he might bring to nothing the things that are:",

    "1 Corinthians 1:31": "that, according as it is written, “He who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.”",
    "1 Corinthians 2:1": "When I came to you, brothers, I didn’t come with excellence of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:2": "For I determined not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:3": "I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:4": "My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,",
    "1 Corinthians 2:5": "that your faith wouldn’t stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:6": "We speak wisdom, however, among those who are full grown; yet a wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who are coming to nothing.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:7": "But we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom that has been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds for our glory,",
    "1 Corinthians 2:8": "which none of the rulers of this world has known. For had they known it, they wouldn’t have crucified the Lord of glory.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:9": "But as it is written, “Things which an eye didn’t see, and an ear didn’t hear, which didn’t enter into the heart of man, these God has prepared for those who love him.”",
    "1 Corinthians 2:10": "But to us, God revealed them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:11": "For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man, which is in him? Even so, no one knows the things of God, except God’s Spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:12": "But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:13": "Which things also we speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:14": "Now the natural man doesn’t receive the things of God’s Spirit, for they are foolishness to him, and he can’t know them, because they are spiritually discerned.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:15": "But he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he himself is judged by no one.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:16": "“For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him?” But we have Christ’s mind.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:1": "Brothers, I couldn’t speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:2": "I fed you with milk, not with meat; for you weren’t yet ready. Indeed, not even now are you ready,",
    "1 Corinthians 3:3": "for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren’t you fleshly, and don’t you walk in the ways of men?",
    "1 Corinthians 3:4": "For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” aren’t you fleshly?",
    "1 Corinthians 3:5": "Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed; and each as the Lord gave to him?",
    "1 Corinthians 3:6": "I planted. Apollos watered. But God gave the increase.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:7": "So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:8": "Now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:9": "For we are God’s fellow workers. You are God’s farming, God’s building.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:10": "According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:11": "For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:12": "But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or stubble;",
    "1 Corinthians 3:13": "each man’s work will be revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man’s work is.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:14": "If any man’s work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:15": "If any man’s work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:16": "Don’t you know that you are a temple of God, and that God’s Spirit lives in you?",
    "1 Corinthians 3:17": "If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him; for God’s temple is holy, which you are.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:18": "Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:19": "For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, “He has taken the wise in their craftiness.”",
    "1 Corinthians 3:20": "And again, “The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless.”",
    "1 Corinthians 3:21": "Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,",
    "1 Corinthians 3:22": "whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All are yours,",
    "1 Corinthians 3:23": "and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:1": "So let a man think of us as Christ’s servants, and stewards of God’s mysteries.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:2": "Here, moreover, it is required of stewards, that they be found faithful.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:3": "But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you, or by man’s judgment. Yes, I don’t judge my own self.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:4": "For I know nothing against myself. Yet I am not justified by this, but he who judges me is the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:5": "Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and reveal the counsels of the hearts. Then each man will get his praise from God.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:6": "Now these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that in us you might learn not to think beyond the things which are written, that none of you be puffed up against one another.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:7": "For who makes you different? And what do you have that you didn’t receive? But if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?",
    "1 Corinthians 4:8": "You are already filled. You have already become rich. You have come to reign without us. Yes, and I wish that you did reign, that we also might reign with you.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:9": "For, I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last of all, like men sentenced to death. For we are made a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:10": "We are fools for Christ’s sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You have honor, but we have dishonor.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:11": "Even to this present hour we hunger, thirst, are naked, are beaten, and have no certain dwelling place.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:12": "We toil, working with our own hands. When people curse us, we bless. Being persecuted, we endure.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:13": "Being defamed, we entreat. We are made as the filth of the world, the dirt wiped off by all, even until now.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:14": "I don’t write these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:15": "For though you have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus, I became your father through the Good News.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:16": "I beg you therefore, be imitators of me.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:17": "Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every assembly.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:18": "Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:19": "But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord is willing. And I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:20": "For the Kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:21": "What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?",
    "1 Corinthians 5:1": "It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles, that one has his father’s wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:2": "You are puffed up, and didn’t rather mourn, that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:3": "For I most certainly, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present, judged him who has done this thing.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:4": "In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,",
    "1 Corinthians 5:5": "are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:6": "Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump?",
    "1 Corinthians 5:7": "Purge out the old yeast, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed in our place.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:8": "Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:9": "I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners;",
    "1 Corinthians 5:10": "yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then you would have to leave the world.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:11": "But as it is, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner. Don’t even eat with such a person.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:12": "For what have I to do with also judging those who are outside? Don’t you judge those who are within?",
    "1 Corinthians 5:13": "But those who are outside, God judges. “Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.”",
    "1 Corinthians 6:1": "Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:2": "Don’t you know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:3": "Don’t you know that we will judge angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:4": "If then, you have to judge things pertaining to this life, do you set them to judge who are of no account in the assembly?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:5": "I say this to move you to shame. Isn’t there even one wise man among you who would be able to decide between his brothers?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:6": "But brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers!",
    "1 Corinthians 6:7": "Therefore it is already altogether a defect in you, that you have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:8": "No, but you yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that against your brothers.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:9": "Or don’t you know that the unrighteous will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Don’t be deceived. Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor homosexuals,",
    "1 Corinthians 6:10": "nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor extortioners, will inherit the Kingdom of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:11": "Such were some of you, but you were washed. But you were sanctified. But you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:12": "“All things are lawful for me,” but not all things are expedient. “All things are lawful for me,” but I will not be brought under the power of anything.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:13": "“Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods,” but God will bring to nothing both it and them. But the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:14": "Now God raised up the Lord, and will also raise us up by his power.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:15": "Don’t you know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them members of a prostitute? May it never be!",
    "1 Corinthians 6:16": "Or don’t you know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body? For, “The two,” says he, “will become one flesh.”",
    "1 Corinthians 6:17": "But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:18": "Flee sexual immorality! “Every sin that a man does is outside the body,” but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:19": "Or don’t you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which you have from God? You are not your own,",
    "1 Corinthians 6:20": "for you were bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:1": "Now concerning the things about which you wrote to me: it is good for a man not to touch a woman.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:2": "But, because of sexual immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:3": "Let the husband render to his wife the affection owed her, and likewise also the wife to her husband.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:4": "The wife doesn’t have authority over her own body, but the husband. Likewise also the husband doesn’t have authority over his own body, but the wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:5": "Don’t deprive one another, unless it is by consent for a season, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer, and may be together again, that Satan doesn’t tempt you because of your lack of self-control.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:6": "But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:7": "Yet I wish that all men were like me. However each man has his own gift from God, one of this kind, and another of that kind.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:8": "But I say to the unmarried and to widows, it is good for them if they remain even as I am.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:9": "But if they don’t have self-control, let them marry. For it’s better to marry than to burn.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:10": "But to the married I command—not I, but the Lord—that the wife not leave her husband",
    "1 Corinthians 7:11": "(but if she departs, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband not leave his wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:12": "But to the rest I—not the Lord—say, if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is content to live with him, let him not leave her.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:13": "The woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he is content to live with her, let her not leave her husband.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:14": "For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:15": "Yet if the unbeliever departs, let there be separation. The brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us in peace.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:16": "For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?",
    "1 Corinthians 7:17": "Only, as the Lord has distributed to each man, as God has called each, so let him walk. So I command in all the assemblies.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:18": "Was anyone called having been circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:19": "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:20": "Let each man stay in that calling in which he was called.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:21": "Were you called being a bondservant? Don’t let that bother you, but if you get an opportunity to become free, use it.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:22": "For he who was called in the Lord being a bondservant is the Lord’s free man. Likewise he who was called being free is Christ’s bondservant.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:23": "You were bought with a price. Don’t become bondservants of men.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:24": "Brothers, let each man, in whatever condition he was called, stay in that condition with God.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:25": "Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:26": "I think that it is good therefore, because of the distress that is on us, that it is good for a man to be as he is.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:27": "Are you bound to a wife? Don’t seek to be freed. Are you free from a wife? Don’t seek a wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:28": "But if you marry, you have not sinned. If a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such will have oppression in the flesh, and I want to spare you.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:29": "But I say this, brothers: the time is short, that from now on, both those who have wives may be as though they had none;",
    "1 Corinthians 7:30": "and those who weep, as though they didn’t weep; and those who rejoice, as though they didn’t rejoice; and those who buy, as though they didn’t possess;",
    "1 Corinthians 7:31": "and those who use the world, as not using it to the fullest. For the mode of this world passes away.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:32": "But I desire to have you to be free from cares. He who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;",
    "1 Corinthians 7:33": "but he who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may please his wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:34": "There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world—how she may please her husband.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:35": "This I say for your own profit; not that I may ensnare you, but for that which is appropriate, and that you may attend to the Lord without distraction.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:36": "But if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of her age, and if need so requires, let him do what he desires. He doesn’t sin. Let them marry.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:37": "But he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own heart, to keep his own virgin, does well.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:38": "So then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well, and he who doesn’t give her in marriage does better.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:39": "A wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives; but if the husband is dead, she is free to be married to whomever she desires, only in the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:40": "But she is happier if she stays as she is, in my judgment, and I think that I also have God’s Spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:1": "Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:2": "But if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he doesn’t yet know as he ought to know.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:3": "But if anyone loves God, the same is known by him.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:4": "Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no other God but one.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:5": "For though there are things that are called “gods,” whether in the heavens or on earth; as there are many “gods” and many “lords;”",
    "1 Corinthians 8:6": "yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we live through him.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:7": "However, that knowledge isn’t in all men. But some, with consciousness of the idol until now, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:8": "But food will not commend us to God. For neither, if we don’t eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:9": "But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:10": "For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol’s temple, won’t his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?",
    "1 Corinthians 8:11": "And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:12": "Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:13": "Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forevermore, that I don’t cause my brother to stumble.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:1": "Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Haven’t I seen Jesus Christ, our Lord? Aren’t you my work in the Lord?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:2": "If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:3": "My defense to those who examine me is this.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:4": "Have we no right to eat and to drink?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:5": "Have we no right to take along a wife who is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:6": "Or have only Barnabas and I no right to not work?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:7": "What soldier ever serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard, and doesn’t eat of its fruit? Or who feeds a flock, and doesn’t drink from the flock’s milk?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:8": "Do I speak these things according to the ways of men? Or doesn’t the law also say the same thing?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:9": "For it is written in the law of Moses, “You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain.” Is it for the oxen that God cares,",
    "1 Corinthians 9:10": "or does he say it assuredly for our sake? Yes, it was written for our sake, because he who plows ought to plow in hope, and he who threshes in hope should partake of his hope.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:11": "If we sowed to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your fleshly things?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:12": "If others partake of this right over you, don’t we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right, but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the Good News of Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:13": "Don’t you know that those who serve around sacred things eat from the things of the temple, and those who wait on the altar have their portion with the altar?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:14": "Even so the Lord ordained that those who proclaim the Good News should live from the Good News.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:15": "But I have used none of these things, and I don’t write these things that it may be done so in my case; for I would rather die, than that anyone should make my boasting void.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:16": "For if I preach the Good News, I have nothing to boast about; for necessity is laid on me; but woe is to me, if I don’t preach the Good News.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:17": "For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward. But if not of my own will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:18": "What then is my reward? That, when I preach the Good News, I may present the Good News of Christ without charge, so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:19": "For though I was free from all, I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:20": "To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain those who are under the law;",
    "1 Corinthians 9:21": "to those who are without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those who are without law.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:22": "To the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:23": "Now I do this for the sake of the Good News, that I may be a joint partaker of it.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:24": "Don’t you know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run like that, that you may win.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:25": "Every man who strives in the games exercises self-control in all things. Now they do it to receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:26": "I therefore run like that, as not uncertainly. I fight like that, as not beating the air,",
    "1 Corinthians 9:27": "but I beat my body and bring it into submission, lest by any means, after I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:1": "Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;",
    "1 Corinthians 10:2": "and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea;",
    "1 Corinthians 10:3": "and all ate the same spiritual food;",
    "1 Corinthians 10:4": "and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:5": "However with most of them, God was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:6": "Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:7": "Neither be idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.”",
    "1 Corinthians 10:8": "Neither let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them committed, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:9": "Neither let us test the Lord, as some of them tested, and perished by the serpents.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:10": "Neither grumble, as some of them also grumbled, and perished by the destroyer.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:11": "Now all these things happened to them by way of example, and they were written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the ages have come.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:12": "Therefore let him who thinks he stands be careful that he doesn’t fall.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:13": "No temptation has taken you except what is common to man. God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted above what you are able, but will with the temptation also make the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:14": "Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:15": "I speak as to wise men. Judge what I say.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:16": "The cup of blessing which we bless, isn’t it a sharing of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, isn’t it a sharing of the body of Christ?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:17": "Because there is one loaf of bread, we, who are many, are one body; for we all partake of the one loaf of bread.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:18": "Consider Israel according to the flesh. Don’t those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:19": "What am I saying then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:20": "But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God, and I don’t desire that you would have fellowship with demons.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:21": "You can’t both drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You can’t both partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:22": "Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:23": "“All things are lawful for me,” but not all things are profitable. “All things are lawful for me,” but not all things build up.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:24": "Let no one seek his own, but each one his neighbor’s good.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:25": "Whatever is sold in the butcher shop, eat, asking no question for the sake of conscience,",
    "1 Corinthians 10:26": "for “the earth is the Lord’s, and its fullness.”",
    "1 Corinthians 10:27": "But if one of those who don’t believe invites you to a meal, and you are inclined to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no questions for the sake of conscience.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:28": "But if anyone says to you, “This was offered to idols,” don’t eat it for the sake of the one who told you, and for the sake of conscience. For “the earth is the Lord’s, and all its fullness.”",
    "1 Corinthians 10:29": "Conscience, I say, not your own, but the other’s conscience. For why is my liberty judged by another conscience?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:30": "If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced for that for which I give thanks?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:31": "Whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:32": "Give no occasions for stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the assembly of God;",
    "1 Corinthians 10:33": "even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of the many, that they may be saved.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:1": "Be imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:2": "Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and hold firm the traditions, even as I delivered them to you.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:3": "But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:4": "Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:5": "But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonors her head. For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:6": "For if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:7": "For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:8": "For man is not from woman, but woman from man;",
    "1 Corinthians 11:9": "for neither was man created for the woman, but woman for the man.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:10": "For this cause the woman ought to have authority on her head, because of the angels.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:11": "Nevertheless, neither is the woman independent of the man, nor the man independent of the woman, in the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:12": "For as woman came from man, so a man also comes through a woman; but all things are from God.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:13": "Judge for yourselves. Is it appropriate that a woman pray to God unveiled?",
    "1 Corinthians 11:14": "Doesn’t even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?",
    "1 Corinthians 11:15": "But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given to her for a covering.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:16": "But if any man seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither do God’s assemblies.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:17": "But in giving you this command, I don’t praise you, that you come together not for the better but for the worse.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:18": "For first of all, when you come together in the assembly, I hear that divisions exist among you, and I partly believe it.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:19": "For there also must be factions among you, that those who are approved may be revealed among you.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:20": "When therefore you assemble yourselves together, it is not the Lord’s supper that you eat.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:21": "For in your eating each one takes his own supper first. One is hungry, and another is drunken.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:22": "What, don’t you have houses to eat and to drink in? Or do you despise God’s assembly, and put them to shame who don’t have? What shall I tell you? Shall I praise you? In this I don’t praise you.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:23": "For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:24": "When he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “Take, eat. This is my body, which is broken for you. Do this in memory of me.”",
    "1 Corinthians 11:25": "In the same way he also took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink, in memory of me.”",
    "1 Corinthians 11:26": "For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:27": "Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord’s cup in a way unworthy of the Lord will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:28": "But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:29": "For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy way eats and drinks judgment to himself, if he doesn’t discern the Lord’s body.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:30": "For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:31": "For if we discerned ourselves, we wouldn’t be judged.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:32": "But when we are judged, we are punished by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:33": "Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:34": "But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest your coming together be for judgment. The rest I will set in order whenever I come.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:1": "Now concerning spiritual things, brothers, I don’t want you to be ignorant.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:2": "You know that when you were heathen, you were led away to those mute idols, however you might be led.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:3": "Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God’s Spirit says, “Jesus is accursed.” No one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” but by the Holy Spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:4": "Now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:5": "There are various kinds of service, and the same Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:6": "There are various kinds of workings, but the same God, who works all things in all.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:7": "But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the profit of all.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:8": "For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;",
    "1 Corinthians 12:9": "to another faith, by the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, by the same Spirit;",
    "1 Corinthians 12:10": "and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; to another different kinds of languages; and to another the interpretation of languages.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:11": "But the one and the same Spirit works all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:12": "For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:13": "For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all given to drink into one Spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:14": "For the body is not one member, but many.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:15": "If the foot would say, “Because I’m not the hand, I’m not part of the body,” it is not therefore not part of the body.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:16": "If the ear would say, “Because I’m not the eye, I’m not part of the body,” it’s not therefore not part of the body.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:17": "If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be?",
    "1 Corinthians 12:18": "But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body, just as he desired.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:19": "If they were all one member, where would the body be?",
    "1 Corinthians 12:20": "But now they are many members, but one body.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:21": "The eye can’t tell the hand, “I have no need for you,” or again the head to the feet, “I have no need for you.”",
    "1 Corinthians 12:22": "No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:23": "Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, on those we bestow more abundant honor; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety;",
    "1 Corinthians 12:24": "whereas our presentable parts have no such need. But God composed the body together, giving more abundant honor to the inferior part,",
    "1 Corinthians 12:25": "that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:26": "When one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. Or when one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:27": "Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:28": "God has set some in the assembly: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle workers, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and various kinds of languages.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:29": "Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all miracle workers?",
    "1 Corinthians 12:30": "Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with various languages? Do all interpret?",
    "1 Corinthians 12:31": "But earnestly desire the best gifts. Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:1": "If I speak with the languages of men and of angels, but don’t have love, I have become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:2": "If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but don’t have love, I am nothing.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:3": "If I dole out all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but don’t have love, it profits me nothing.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:4": "Love is patient and is kind; love doesn’t envy. Love doesn’t brag, is not proud,",
    "1 Corinthians 13:5": "doesn’t behave itself inappropriately, doesn’t seek its own way, is not provoked, takes no account of evil;",
    "1 Corinthians 13:6": "doesn’t rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;",
    "1 Corinthians 13:7": "bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:8": "Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will be done away with. Where there are various languages, they will cease. Where there is knowledge, it will be done away with.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:9": "For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;",
    "1 Corinthians 13:10": "but when that which is complete has come, then that which is partial will be done away with.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:11": "When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child. Now that I have become a man, I have put away childish things.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:12": "For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, even as I was also fully known.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:13": "But now faith, hope, and love remain—these three. The greatest of these is love.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:1": "Follow after love, and earnestly desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:2": "For he who speaks in another language speaks not to men, but to God; for no one understands; but in the Spirit he speaks mysteries.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:3": "But he who prophesies speaks to men for their edification, exhortation, and consolation.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:4": "He who speaks in another language edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the assembly.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:5": "Now I desire to have you all speak with other languages, but rather that you would prophesy. For he is greater who prophesies than he who speaks with other languages, unless he interprets, that the assembly may be built up.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:6": "But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking with other languages, what would I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:7": "Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they didn’t give a distinction in the sounds, how would it be known what is piped or harped?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:8": "For if the trumpet gave an uncertain sound, who would prepare himself for war?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:9": "So also you, unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand, how would it be known what is spoken? For you would be speaking into the air.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:10": "There are, it may be, so many kinds of sounds in the world, and none of them is without meaning.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:11": "If then I don’t know the meaning of the sound, I would be to him who speaks a foreigner, and he who speaks would be a foreigner to me.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:12": "So also you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the building up of the assembly.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:13": "Therefore let him who speaks in another language pray that he may interpret.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:14": "For if I pray in another language, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:15": "What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also. I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:16": "Otherwise if you bless with the spirit, how will he who fills the place of the unlearned say the “Amen” at your giving of thanks, seeing he doesn’t know what you say?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:17": "For you most certainly give thanks well, but the other person is not built up.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:18": "I thank my God, I speak with other languages more than you all.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:19": "However in the assembly I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in another language.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:20": "Brothers, don’t be children in thoughts, yet in malice be babies, but in thoughts be mature.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:21": "In the law it is written, “By men of strange languages and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people. Not even thus will they hear me, says the Lord.”",
    "1 Corinthians 14:22": "Therefore other languages are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelieving; but prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to those who believe.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:23": "If therefore the whole assembly is assembled together and all speak with other languages, and unlearned or unbelieving people come in, won’t they say that you are crazy?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:24": "But if all prophesy, and someone unbelieving or unlearned comes in, he is reproved by all, and he is judged by all.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:25": "And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed. So he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:26": "What is it then, brothers? When you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has another language, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to build each other up.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:27": "If any man speaks in another language, let it be two, or at the most three, and in turn; and let one interpret.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:28": "But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the assembly, and let him speak to himself, and to God.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:29": "Let the prophets speak, two or three, and let the others discern.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:30": "But if a revelation is made to another sitting by, let the first keep silent.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:31": "For you all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:32": "The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,",
    "1 Corinthians 14:33": "for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace. As in all the assemblies of the saints,",
    "1 Corinthians 14:34": "let your wives keep silent in the assemblies, for it has not been permitted for them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as the law also says.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:35": "If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a woman to chatter in the assembly.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:36": "What? Was it from you that the word of God went out? Or did it come to you alone?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:37": "If any man thinks himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him recognize the things which I write to you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:38": "But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:39": "Therefore, brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy, and don’t forbid speaking with other languages.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:40": "Let all things be done decently and in order.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:1": "Now I declare to you, brothers, the Good News which I preached to you, which also you received, in which you also stand,",
    "1 Corinthians 15:2": "by which also you are saved, if you hold firmly the word which I preached to you—unless you believed in vain.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:3": "For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,",
    "1 Corinthians 15:4": "that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,",
    "1 Corinthians 15:5": "and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:6": "Then he appeared to over five hundred brothers at once, most of whom remain until now, but some have also fallen asleep.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:7": "Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles,",
    "1 Corinthians 15:8": "and last of all, as to the child born at the wrong time, he appeared to me also.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:9": "For I am the least of the apostles, who is not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the assembly of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:10": "But by the grace of God I am what I am. His grace which was bestowed on me was not futile, but I worked more than all of them; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:11": "Whether then it is I or they, so we preach, and so you believed.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:12": "Now if Christ is preached, that he has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?",
    "1 Corinthians 15:13": "But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:14": "If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith also is in vain.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:15": "Yes, we are found false witnesses of God, because we testified about God that he raised up Christ, whom he didn’t raise up, if it is so that the dead are not raised.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:16": "For if the dead aren’t raised, neither has Christ been raised.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:17": "If Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain; you are still in your sins.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:18": "Then they also who are fallen asleep in Christ have perished.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:19": "If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:20": "But now Christ has been raised from the dead. He became the first fruits of those who are asleep.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:21": "For since death came by man, the resurrection of the dead also came by man.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:22": "For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:23": "But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then those who are Christ’s, at his coming.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:24": "Then the end comes, when he will deliver up the Kingdom to God, even the Father; when he will have abolished all rule and all authority and power.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:25": "For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:26": "The last enemy that will be abolished is death.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:27": "For, “He put all things in subjection under his feet.” But when he says, “All things are put in subjection,” it is evident that he is excepted who subjected all things to him.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:28": "When all things have been subjected to him, then the Son will also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:29": "Or else what will they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead aren’t raised at all, why then are they baptized for the dead?",
    "1 Corinthians 15:30": "Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?",
    "1 Corinthians 15:31": "I affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:32": "If I fought with animals at Ephesus for human purposes, what does it profit me? If the dead are not raised, then “let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”",
    "1 Corinthians 15:33": "Don’t be deceived! “Evil companionships corrupt good morals.”",
    "1 Corinthians 15:34": "Wake up righteously, and don’t sin, for some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:35": "But someone will say, “How are the dead raised?” and, “With what kind of body do they come?”",
    "1 Corinthians 15:36": "You foolish one, that which you yourself sow is not made alive unless it dies.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:37": "That which you sow, you don’t sow the body that will be, but a bare grain, maybe of wheat, or of some other kind.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:38": "But God gives it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:39": "All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish, and another of birds.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:40": "There are also celestial bodies, and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial differs from that of the terrestrial.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:41": "There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:42": "So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:43": "It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:44": "It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body and there is also a spiritual body.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:45": "So also it is written, “The first man, Adam, became a living soul.” The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:46": "However that which is spiritual isn’t first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:47": "The first man is of the earth, made of dust. The second man is the Lord from heaven.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:48": "As is the one made of dust, such are those who are also made of dust; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:49": "As we have borne the image of those made of dust, let’s also bear the image of the heavenly.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:50": "Now I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood can’t inherit the Kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:51": "Behold, I tell you a mystery. We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,",
    "1 Corinthians 15:52": "in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:53": "For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:54": "But when this corruptible will have put on incorruption, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then what is written will happen: “Death is swallowed up in victory.”",
    "1 Corinthians 15:55": "“Death, where is your sting? Hades, where is your victory?”",
    "1 Corinthians 15:56": "The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:57": "But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:58": "Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the Lord’s work, because you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:1": "Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I commanded the assemblies of Galatia, you do likewise.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:2": "On the first day of the week, let each one of you save, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:3": "When I arrive, I will send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:4": "If it is appropriate for me to go also, they will go with me.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:5": "But I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia, for I am passing through Macedonia.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:6": "But with you it may be that I will stay, or even winter, that you may send me on my journey wherever I go.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:7": "For I do not wish to see you now in passing, but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:8": "But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost,",
    "1 Corinthians 16:9": "for a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:10": "Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:11": "Therefore let no one despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brothers.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:12": "Now concerning Apollos, the brother, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers; and it was not at all his desire to come now; but he will come when he has an opportunity.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:13": "Watch! Stand firm in the faith! Be courageous! Be strong!",
    "1 Corinthians 16:14": "Let all that you do be done in love.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:15": "Now I beg you, brothers (you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to serve the saints),",
    "1 Corinthians 16:16": "that you also be in subjection to such, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:17": "I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for that which was lacking on your part, they supplied.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:18": "For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge those who are like that.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:19": "The assemblies of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord, together with the assembly that is in their house.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:20": "All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:21": "This greeting is by me, Paul, with my own hand.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:22": "If any man doesn’t love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. Come, Lord!",
    "1 Corinthians 16:23": "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:24": "My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:1": "Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the assembly of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia:",
    "2 Corinthians 1:2": "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:3": "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort;",
    "2 Corinthians 1:4": "who comforts us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:5": "For as the sufferings of Christ abound to us, even so our comfort also abounds through Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:6": "But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation. If we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:7": "Our hope for you is steadfast, knowing that, since you are partakers of the sufferings, so also are you of the comfort.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:8": "For we don’t desire to have you uninformed, brothers, concerning our affliction which happened to us in Asia, that we were weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, so much that we despaired even of life.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:9": "Yes, we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead,",
    "2 Corinthians 1:10": "who delivered us out of so great a death, and does deliver; on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us;",
    "2 Corinthians 1:11": "you also helping together on our behalf by your supplication; that, for the gift bestowed on us by means of many, thanks may be given by many persons on your behalf.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:12": "For our boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:13": "For we write no other things to you, than what you read or even acknowledge, and I hope you will acknowledge to the end;",
    "2 Corinthians 1:14": "as also you acknowledged us in part, that we are your boasting, even as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:15": "In this confidence, I was determined to come first to you, that you might have a second benefit;",
    "2 Corinthians 1:16": "and by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and to be sent forward by you on my journey to Judea.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:17": "When I therefore was thus determined, did I show fickleness? Or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be the “Yes, yes” and the “No, no?”",
    "2 Corinthians 1:18": "But as God is faithful, our word toward you was not “Yes and no.”",
    "2 Corinthians 1:19": "For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, by me, Silvanus, and Timothy, was not “Yes and no,” but in him is “Yes.”",
    "2 Corinthians 1:20": "For however many are the promises of God, in him is the “Yes.” Therefore also through him is the “Amen,” to the glory of God through us.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:21": "Now he who establishes us with you in Christ, and anointed us, is God;",
    "2 Corinthians 1:22": "who also sealed us, and gave us the down payment of the Spirit in our hearts.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:23": "But I call God for a witness to my soul, that I didn’t come to Corinth to spare you.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:24": "Not that we have lordship over your faith, but are fellow workers with you for your joy. For you stand firm in faith.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:1": "But I determined this for myself, that I would not come to you again in sorrow.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:2": "For if I make you sorry, then who will make me glad but he who is made sorry by me?",
    "2 Corinthians 2:3": "And I wrote this very thing to you, so that, when I came, I wouldn’t have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy would be shared by all of you.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:4": "For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that you should be made sorry, but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for you.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:5": "But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I not press too heavily) to you all.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:6": "Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many;",
    "2 Corinthians 2:7": "so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:8": "Therefore I beg you to confirm your love toward him.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:9": "For to this end I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:10": "Now I also forgive whomever you forgive anything. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ,",
    "2 Corinthians 2:11": "that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:12": "Now when I came to Troas for the Good News of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord,",
    "2 Corinthians 2:13": "I had no relief for my spirit, because I didn’t find Titus, my brother, but taking my leave of them, I went out into Macedonia.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:14": "Now thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:15": "For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God, in those who are saved, and in those who perish;",
    "2 Corinthians 2:16": "to the one a stench from death to death; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?",
    "2 Corinthians 2:17": "For we are not as so many, peddling the word of God. But as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:1": "Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? Or do we need, as do some, letters of commendation to you or from you?",
    "2 Corinthians 3:2": "You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men;",
    "2 Corinthians 3:3": "being revealed that you are a letter of Christ, served by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in tablets that are hearts of flesh.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:4": "Such confidence we have through Christ toward God;",
    "2 Corinthians 3:5": "not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God;",
    "2 Corinthians 3:6": "who also made us sufficient as servants of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:7": "But if the service of death, written engraved on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look steadfastly on the face of Moses for the glory of his face; which was passing away:",
    "2 Corinthians 3:8": "won’t service of the Spirit be with much more glory?",
    "2 Corinthians 3:9": "For if the service of condemnation has glory, the service of righteousness exceeds much more in glory.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:10": "For most certainly that which has been made glorious has not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasses.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:11": "For if that which passes away was with glory, much more that which remains is in glory.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:12": "Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech,",
    "2 Corinthians 3:13": "and not as Moses, who put a veil on his face, that the children of Israel wouldn’t look steadfastly on the end of that which was passing away.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:14": "But their minds were hardened, for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains, because in Christ it passes away.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:15": "But to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:16": "But whenever one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:17": "Now the Lord is the Spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:18": "But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord, the Spirit.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:1": "Therefore seeing we have this ministry, even as we obtained mercy, we don’t faint.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:2": "But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:3": "Even if our Good News is veiled, it is veiled in those who perish;",
    "2 Corinthians 4:4": "in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that the light of the Good News of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not dawn on them.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:5": "For we don’t preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake;",
    "2 Corinthians 4:6": "seeing it is God who said, “Light will shine out of darkness,” who has shone in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:7": "But we have this treasure in clay vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God, and not from ourselves.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:8": "We are pressed on every side, yet not crushed; perplexed, yet not to despair;",
    "2 Corinthians 4:9": "pursued, yet not forsaken; struck down, yet not destroyed;",
    "2 Corinthians 4:10": "always carrying in the body the putting to death of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:11": "For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal flesh.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:12": "So then death works in us, but life in you.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:13": "But having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, “I believed, and therefore I spoke.” We also believe, and therefore also we speak;",
    "2 Corinthians 4:14": "knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus, and will present us with you.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:15": "For all things are for your sakes, that the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:16": "Therefore we don’t faint, but though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:17": "For our light affliction, which is for the moment, works for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory;",
    "2 Corinthians 4:18": "while we don’t look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:1": "For we know that if the earthly house of our tent is dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:2": "For most certainly in this we groan, longing to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven;",
    "2 Corinthians 5:3": "if so be that being clothed we will not be found naked.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:4": "For indeed we who are in this tent do groan, being burdened; not that we desire to be unclothed, but that we desire to be clothed, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:5": "Now he who made us for this very thing is God, who also gave to us the down payment of the Spirit.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:6": "Therefore, we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord;",
    "2 Corinthians 5:7": "for we walk by faith, not by sight.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:8": "We are courageous, I say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:9": "Therefore also we make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well pleasing to him.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:10": "For we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:11": "Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are revealed to God; and I hope that we are revealed also in your consciences.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:12": "For we are not commending ourselves to you again, but speak as giving you occasion of boasting on our behalf, that you may have something to answer those who boast in appearance, and not in heart.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:13": "For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God. Or if we are of sober mind, it is for you.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:14": "For the love of Christ constrains us; because we judge thus, that one died for all, therefore all died.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:15": "He died for all, that those who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who for their sakes died and rose again.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:16": "Therefore we know no one after the flesh from now on. Even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know him so no more.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:17": "Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away. Behold, all things have become new.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:18": "But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation;",
    "2 Corinthians 5:19": "namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses, and having committed to us the word of reconciliation.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:20": "We are therefore ambassadors on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us: we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:21": "For him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf; so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:1": "Working together, we entreat also that you not receive the grace of God in vain,",
    "2 Corinthians 6:2": "for he says, “At an acceptable time I listened to you, in a day of salvation I helped you.” Behold, now is the acceptable time. Behold, now is the day of salvation.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:3": "We give no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our service may not be blamed,",
    "2 Corinthians 6:4": "but in everything commending ourselves, as servants of God, in great endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses,",
    "2 Corinthians 6:5": "in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;",
    "2 Corinthians 6:6": "in pureness, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love,",
    "2 Corinthians 6:7": "in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,",
    "2 Corinthians 6:8": "by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true;",
    "2 Corinthians 6:9": "as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and not killed;",
    "2 Corinthians 6:10": "as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:11": "Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians. Our heart is enlarged.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:12": "You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:13": "Now in return, I speak as to my children, you also be open wide.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:14": "Don’t be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?",
    "2 Corinthians 6:15": "What agreement has Christ with Belial? Or what portion has a believer with an unbeliever?",
    "2 Corinthians 6:16": "What agreement has a temple of God with idols? For you are a temple of the living God. Even as God said, “I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they will be my people.”",
    "2 Corinthians 6:17": "Therefore, “‘Come out from among them, and be separate,’ says the Lord. ‘Touch no unclean thing. I will receive you.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:18": "I will be to you a Father. You will be to me sons and daughters,’ says the Lord Almighty.”",
    "2 Corinthians 7:1": "Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:2": "Open your hearts to us. We wronged no one. We corrupted no one. We took advantage of no one.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:3": "I say this not to condemn you, for I have said before, that you are in our hearts to die together and live together.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:4": "Great is my boldness of speech toward you. Great is my boasting on your behalf. I am filled with comfort. I overflow with joy in all our affliction.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:5": "For even when we had come into Macedonia, our flesh had no relief, but we were afflicted on every side. Fightings were outside. Fear was inside.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:6": "Nevertheless, he who comforts the lowly, God, comforted us by the coming of Titus;",
    "2 Corinthians 7:7": "and not by his coming only, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, while he told us of your longing, your mourning, and your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced still more.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:8": "For though I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it, though I did regret it. For I see that my letter made you sorry, though just for a while.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:9": "I now rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you were made sorry to repentance. For you were made sorry in a godly way, that you might suffer loss by us in nothing.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:10": "For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation, which brings no regret. But the sorrow of the world works death.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:11": "For behold, this same thing, that you were made sorry in a godly way, what earnest care it worked in you. Yes, what defense, indignation, fear, longing, zeal, and vengeance! In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be pure in the matter.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:12": "So although I wrote to you, I wrote not for his cause that did the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered the wrong, but that your earnest care for us might be revealed in you in the sight of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:13": "Therefore we have been comforted. In our comfort we rejoiced the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:14": "For if in anything I have boasted to him on your behalf, I was not disappointed. But as we spoke all things to you in truth, so our glorying also which I made before Titus was found to be truth.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:15": "His affection is more abundantly toward you, while he remembers all of your obedience, how with fear and trembling you received him.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:16": "I rejoice that in everything I am confident concerning you.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:1": "Moreover, brothers, we make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the assemblies of Macedonia;",
    "2 Corinthians 8:2": "how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:3": "For according to their power, I testify, yes and beyond their power, they gave of their own accord,",
    "2 Corinthians 8:4": "begging us with much entreaty to receive this grace and the fellowship in the service to the saints.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:5": "This was not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:6": "So we urged Titus, that as he made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:7": "But as you abound in everything, in faith, utterance, knowledge, all earnestness, and in your love to us, see that you also abound in this grace.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:8": "I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:9": "For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might become rich.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:10": "I give a judgment in this: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to start a year ago, not only to do, but also to be willing.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:11": "But now complete the doing also, that as there was the readiness to be willing, so there may be the completion also out of your ability.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:12": "For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what you have, not according to what you don’t have.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:13": "For this is not that others may be eased and you distressed,",
    "2 Corinthians 8:14": "but for equality. Your abundance at this present time supplies their lack, that their abundance also may become a supply for your lack; that there may be equality.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:15": "As it is written, “He who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack.”",
    "2 Corinthians 8:16": "But thanks be to God, who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:17": "For he indeed accepted our exhortation, but being himself very earnest, he went out to you of his own accord.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:18": "We have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the Good News is known through all the assemblies.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:19": "Not only so, but who was also appointed by the assemblies to travel with us in this grace, which is served by us to the glory of the Lord himself, and to show our readiness.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:20": "We are avoiding this, that any man should blame us concerning this abundance which is administered by us.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:21": "Having regard for honorable things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:22": "We have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which he has in you.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:23": "As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you. As for our brothers, they are the apostles of the assemblies, the glory of Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:24": "Therefore show the proof of your love to them in front of the assemblies, and of our boasting on your behalf.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:1": "It is indeed unnecessary for me to write to you concerning the service to the saints,",
    "2 Corinthians 9:2": "for I know your readiness, of which I boast on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia has been prepared for a year past. Your zeal has stirred up very many of them.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:3": "But I have sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf may not be in vain in this respect, that, just as I said, you may be prepared,",
    "2 Corinthians 9:4": "so that I won’t by any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared, we (to say nothing of you) should be disappointed in this confident boasting.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:5": "I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brothers that they would go before to you, and arrange ahead of time the generous gift that you promised before, that the same might be ready as a matter of generosity, and not of greediness.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:6": "Remember this: he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly. He who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:7": "Let each man give according as he has determined in his heart; not grudgingly, or under compulsion; for God loves a cheerful giver.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:8": "And God is able to make all grace abound to you, that you, always having all sufficiency in everything, may abound to every good work.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:9": "As it is written, “He has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor. His righteousness remains forever.”",
    "2 Corinthians 9:10": "Now may he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food, supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;",
    "2 Corinthians 9:11": "you being enriched in everything to all liberality, which works through us thanksgiving to God.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:12": "For this service of giving that you perform not only makes up for lack among the saints, but abounds also through many givings of thanks to God;",
    "2 Corinthians 9:13": "seeing that through the proof given by this service, they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the Good News of Christ, and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all;",
    "2 Corinthians 9:14": "while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, yearn for you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:15": "Now thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift!",
    "2 Corinthians 10:1": "Now I Paul, myself, entreat you by the humility and gentleness of Christ; I who in your presence am lowly among you, but being absent am bold toward you.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:2": "Yes, I beg you that I may not, when present, show courage with the confidence with which I intend to be bold against some, who consider us to be walking according to the flesh.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:3": "For though we walk in the flesh, we don’t wage war according to the flesh;",
    "2 Corinthians 10:4": "for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty before God to the throwing down of strongholds,",
    "2 Corinthians 10:5": "throwing down imaginations and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ;",
    "2 Corinthians 10:6": "and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience will be made full.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:7": "Do you look at things only as they appear in front of your face? If anyone trusts in himself that he is Christ’s, let him consider this again with himself, that, even as he is Christ’s, so also we are Christ’s.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:8": "For though I should boast somewhat abundantly concerning our authority, (which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for casting you down) I will not be disappointed,",
    "2 Corinthians 10:9": "that I may not seem as if I desire to terrify you by my letters.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:10": "For, “His letters,” they say, “are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech is despised.”",
    "2 Corinthians 10:11": "Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such are we also in deed when we are present.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:12": "For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves. But they themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:13": "But we will not boast beyond proper limits, but within the boundaries with which God appointed to us, which reach even to you.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:14": "For we don’t stretch ourselves too much, as though we didn’t reach to you. For we came even as far as to you with the Good News of Christ,",
    "2 Corinthians 10:15": "not boasting beyond proper limits in other men’s labors, but having hope that as your faith grows, we will be abundantly enlarged by you in our sphere of influence,",
    "2 Corinthians 10:16": "so as to preach the Good News even to the parts beyond you, not to boast in what someone else has already done.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:17": "But “he who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.”",
    "2 Corinthians 10:18": "For it isn’t he who commends himself who is approved, but whom the Lord commends.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:1": "I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness, but indeed you do bear with me.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:2": "For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy. For I married you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:3": "But I am afraid that somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve in his craftiness, so your minds might be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:4": "For if he who comes preaches another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or if you receive a different spirit, which you did not receive, or a different “good news”, which you did not accept, you put up with that well enough.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:5": "For I reckon that I am not at all behind the very best apostles.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:6": "But though I am unskilled in speech, yet I am not unskilled in knowledge. No, in every way we have been revealed to you in all things.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:7": "Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself that you might be exalted, because I preached to you God’s Good News free of charge?",
    "2 Corinthians 11:8": "I robbed other assemblies, taking wages from them that I might serve you.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:9": "When I was present with you and was in need, I wasn’t a burden on anyone, for the brothers, when they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my need. In everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you, and I will continue to do so.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:10": "As the truth of Christ is in me, no one will stop me from this boasting in the regions of Achaia.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:11": "Why? Because I don’t love you? God knows.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:12": "But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion, that in which they boast, they may be found even as we.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:13": "For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as Christ’s apostles.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:14": "And no wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:15": "It is no great thing therefore if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:16": "I say again, let no one think me foolish. But if so, yet receive me as foolish, that I also may boast a little.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:17": "That which I speak, I don’t speak according to the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:18": "Seeing that many boast after the flesh, I will also boast.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:19": "For you bear with the foolish gladly, being wise.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:20": "For you bear with a man, if he brings you into bondage, if he devours you, if he takes you captive, if he exalts himself, if he strikes you on the face.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:21": "I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet however any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:22": "Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? So am I.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:23": "Are they servants of Christ? (I speak as one beside himself) I am more so; in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths often.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:24": "Five times from the Jews I received forty stripes minus one.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:25": "Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I suffered shipwreck. I have been a night and a day in the deep.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:26": "I have been in travels often, perils of rivers, perils of robbers, perils from my countrymen, perils from the Gentiles, perils in the city, perils in the wilderness, perils in the sea, perils among false brothers;",
    "2 Corinthians 11:27": "in labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, and in cold and nakedness.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:28": "Besides those things that are outside, there is that which presses on me daily, anxiety for all the assemblies.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:29": "Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is caused to stumble, and I don’t burn with indignation?",
    "2 Corinthians 11:30": "If I must boast, I will boast of the things that concern my weakness.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:31": "The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, he who is blessed forevermore, knows that I don’t lie.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:32": "In Damascus the governor under King Aretas guarded the city of the Damascenes desiring to arrest me.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:33": "Through a window I was let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:1": "It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast. For I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:2": "I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I don’t know, or whether out of the body, I don’t know; God knows), such a one caught up into the third heaven.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:3": "I know such a man (whether in the body, or outside of the body, I don’t know; God knows),",
    "2 Corinthians 12:4": "how he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:5": "On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:6": "For if I would desire to boast, I will not be foolish; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me, or hears from me.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:7": "By reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted excessively, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me, that I should not be exalted excessively.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:8": "Concerning this thing, I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:9": "He has said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest on me.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:10": "Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:11": "I have become foolish in boasting. You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for in nothing was I inferior to the very best apostles, though I am nothing.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:12": "Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs and wonders and mighty works.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:13": "For what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies, unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:14": "Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I seek not your possessions, but you. For the children ought not to save up for the parents, but the parents for the children.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:15": "I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?",
    "2 Corinthians 12:16": "But be it so, I did not myself burden you. But, being crafty, I caught you with deception.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:17": "Did I take advantage of you by anyone of them whom I have sent to you?",
    "2 Corinthians 12:18": "I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Didn’t we walk in the same spirit? Didn’t we walk in the same steps?",
    "2 Corinthians 12:19": "Again, do you think that we are excusing ourselves to you? In the sight of God we speak in Christ. But all things, beloved, are for your edifying.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:20": "For I am afraid that by any means, when I come, I might find you not the way I want to, and that I might be found by you as you don’t desire; that by any means there would be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, whisperings, proud thoughts, riots;",
    "2 Corinthians 12:21": "that again when I come my God would humble me before you, and I would mourn for many of those who have sinned before now, and not repented of the uncleanness and sexual immorality and lustfulness which they committed.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:1": "This is the third time I am coming to you. “At the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.”",
    "2 Corinthians 13:2": "I have said beforehand, and I do say beforehand, as when I was present the second time, so now, being absent, I write to those who have sinned before now, and to all the rest, that, if I come again, I will not spare;",
    "2 Corinthians 13:3": "seeing that you seek a proof of Christ who speaks in me; who toward you is not weak, but is powerful in you.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:4": "For he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives through the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we will live with him through the power of God toward you.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:5": "Test your own selves, whether you are in the faith. Test your own selves. Or don’t you know as to your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless indeed you are disqualified.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:6": "But I hope that you will know that we aren’t disqualified.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:7": "Now I pray to God that you do no evil; not that we may appear approved, but that you may do that which is honorable, though we are as reprobate.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:8": "For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:9": "For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong. And this we also pray for, even your perfecting.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:10": "For this cause I write these things while absent, that I may not deal sharply when present, according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for tearing down.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:11": "Finally, brothers, rejoice. Be perfected, be comforted, be of the same mind, live in peace, and the God of love and peace will be with you.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:12": "Greet one another with a holy kiss.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:13": "All the saints greet you.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:14": "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all. Amen.",
    "Galatians 1:1": "Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead),",
    "Galatians 1:2": "and all the brothers who are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:",
    "Galatians 1:3": "Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,",
    "Galatians 1:4": "who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father—",
    "Galatians 1:5": "to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.",
    "Galatians 1:6": "I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different “good news”;",
    "Galatians 1:7": "and there isn’t another “good news.” Only there are some who trouble you, and want to pervert the Good News of Christ.",
    "Galatians 1:8": "But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any “good news” other than that which we preached to you, let him be cursed.",
    "Galatians 1:9": "As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to you any “good news” other than that which you received, let him be cursed.",
    "Galatians 1:10": "For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn’t be a servant of Christ.",
    "Galatians 1:11": "But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News which was preached by me, that it is not according to man.",
    "Galatians 1:12": "For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.",
    "Galatians 1:13": "For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God, and ravaged it.",
    "Galatians 1:14": "I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.",
    "Galatians 1:15": "But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called me through his grace,",
    "Galatians 1:16": "to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn’t immediately confer with flesh and blood,",
    "Galatians 1:17": "nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned to Damascus.",
    "Galatians 1:18": "Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.",
    "Galatians 1:19": "But of the other apostles I saw no one, except James, the Lord’s brother.",
    "Galatians 1:20": "Now about the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I’m not lying.",
    "Galatians 1:21": "Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.",
    "Galatians 1:22": "I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ,",
    "Galatians 1:23": "but they only heard: “He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy.”",
    "Galatians 1:24": "And they glorified God in me.",
    "Galatians 2:1": "Then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.",
    "Galatians 2:2": "I went up by revelation, and I laid before them the Good News which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately before those who were respected, for fear that I might be running, or had run, in vain.",
    "Galatians 2:3": "But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.",
    "Galatians 2:4": "This was because of the false brothers secretly brought in, who stole in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage;",
    "Galatians 2:5": "to whom we gave no place in the way of subjection, not for an hour, that the truth of the Good News might continue with you.",
    "Galatians 2:6": "But from those who were reputed to be important (whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God doesn’t show partiality to man)—they, I say, who were respected imparted nothing to me,",
    "Galatians 2:7": "but to the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the Good News for the uncircumcision, even as Peter with the Good News for the circumcision",
    "Galatians 2:8": "(for he who appointed Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision appointed me also to the Gentiles);",
    "Galatians 2:9": "and when they perceived the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, they who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision.",
    "Galatians 2:10": "They only asked us to remember the poor—which very thing I was also zealous to do.",
    "Galatians 2:11": "But when Peter came to Antioch, I resisted him to his face, because he stood condemned.",
    "Galatians 2:12": "For before some people came from James, he ate with the Gentiles. But when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.",
    "Galatians 2:13": "And the rest of the Jews joined him in his hypocrisy; so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.",
    "Galatians 2:14": "But when I saw that they didn’t walk uprightly according to the truth of the Good News, I said to Peter before them all, “If you, being a Jew, live as the Gentiles do, and not as the Jews do, why do you compel the Gentiles to live as the Jews do?",
    "Galatians 2:15": "“We, being Jews by nature, and not Gentile sinners,",
    "Galatians 2:16": "yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law, because no flesh will be justified by the works of the law.",
    "Galatians 2:17": "But if, while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? Certainly not!",
    "Galatians 2:18": "For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove myself a law-breaker.",
    "Galatians 2:19": "For I, through the law, died to the law, that I might live to God.",
    "Galatians 2:20": "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I that live, but Christ living in me. That life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself up for me.",
    "Galatians 2:21": "I don’t make void the grace of God. For if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nothing!”",
    "Galatians 3:1": "Foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you not to obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth among you as crucified?",
    "Galatians 3:2": "I just want to learn this from you. Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?",
    "Galatians 3:3": "Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now completed in the flesh?",
    "Galatians 3:4": "Did you suffer so many things in vain, if it is indeed in vain?",
    "Galatians 3:5": "He therefore who supplies the Spirit to you, and works miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?",
    "Galatians 3:6": "Even as Abraham “believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.”",
    "Galatians 3:7": "Know therefore that those who are of faith, the same are children of Abraham.",
    "Galatians 3:8": "The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the Good News beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you all the nations will be blessed.”",
    "Galatians 3:9": "So then, those who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.",
    "Galatians 3:10": "For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written, “Cursed is everyone who doesn’t continue in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.”",
    "Galatians 3:11": "Now that no man is justified by the law before God is evident, for, “The righteous will live by faith.”",
    "Galatians 3:12": "The law is not of faith, but, “The man who does them will live by them.”",
    "Galatians 3:13": "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us. For it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,”",
    "Galatians 3:14": "that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.",
    "Galatians 3:15": "Brothers, speaking of human terms, though it is only a man’s covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void, or adds to it.",
    "Galatians 3:16": "Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He doesn’t say, “To seeds,” as of many, but as of one, “To your seed,” which is Christ.",
    "Galatians 3:17": "Now I say this. A covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ, the law, which came four hundred thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect.",
    "Galatians 3:18": "For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise.",
    "Galatians 3:19": "What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the seed should come to whom the promise has been made. It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.",
    "Galatians 3:20": "Now a mediator is not between one, but God is one.",
    "Galatians 3:21": "Is the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could make alive, most certainly righteousness would have been of the law.",
    "Galatians 3:22": "But the Scriptures imprisoned all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.",
    "Galatians 3:23": "But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, confined for the faith which should afterwards be revealed.",
    "Galatians 3:24": "So that the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.",
    "Galatians 3:25": "But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.",
    "Galatians 3:26": "For you are all children of God, through faith in Christ Jesus.",
    "Galatians 3:27": "For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.",
    "Galatians 3:28": "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.",
    "Galatians 3:29": "If you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s seed and heirs according to promise.",
    "Galatians 4:1": "But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a bondservant, though he is lord of all;",
    "Galatians 4:2": "but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed by the father.",
    "Galatians 4:3": "So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the elemental principles of the world.",
    "Galatians 4:4": "But when the fullness of the time came, God sent out his Son, born to a woman, born under the law,",
    "Galatians 4:5": "that he might redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of children.",
    "Galatians 4:6": "And because you are children, God sent out the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, “Abba, Father!”",
    "Galatians 4:7": "So you are no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.",
    "Galatians 4:8": "However at that time, not knowing God, you were in bondage to those who by nature are not gods.",
    "Galatians 4:9": "But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, why do you turn back again to the weak and miserable elemental principles, to which you desire to be in bondage all over again?",
    "Galatians 4:10": "You observe days, months, seasons, and years.",
    "Galatians 4:11": "I am afraid for you, that I might have wasted my labor for you.",
    "Galatians 4:12": "I beg you, brothers, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You did me no wrong,",
    "Galatians 4:13": "but you know that because of weakness of the flesh I preached the Good News to you the first time.",
    "Galatians 4:14": "That which was a temptation to you in my flesh, you didn’t despise nor reject; but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.",
    "Galatians 4:15": "What was the blessing you enjoyed? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.",
    "Galatians 4:16": "So then, have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?",
    "Galatians 4:17": "They zealously seek you in no good way. No, they desire to alienate you, that you may seek them.",
    "Galatians 4:18": "But it is always good to be zealous in a good cause, and not only when I am present with you.",
    "Galatians 4:19": "My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you—",
    "Galatians 4:20": "but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.",
    "Galatians 4:21": "Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, don’t you listen to the law?",
    "Galatians 4:22": "For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the free woman.",
    "Galatians 4:23": "However, the son by the handmaid was born according to the flesh, but the son by the free woman was born through promise.",
    "Galatians 4:24": "These things contain an allegory, for these are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children to bondage, which is Hagar.",
    "Galatians 4:25": "For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now, for she is in bondage with her children.",
    "Galatians 4:26": "But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is the mother of us all.",
    "Galatians 4:27": "For it is written, “Rejoice, you barren who don’t bear. Break forth and shout, you that don’t travail. For more are the children of the desolate than of her who has a husband.”",
    "Galatians 4:28": "Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are children of promise.",
    "Galatians 4:29": "But as then, he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now.",
    "Galatians 4:30": "However what does the Scripture say? “Throw out the handmaid and her son, for the son of the handmaid will not inherit with the son of the free woman.”",
    "Galatians 4:31": "So then, brothers, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the free woman.",
    "Galatians 5:1": "Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and don’t be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.",
    "Galatians 5:2": "Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.",
    "Galatians 5:3": "Yes, I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.",
    "Galatians 5:4": "You are alienated from Christ, you who desire to be justified by the law. You have fallen away from grace.",
    "Galatians 5:5": "For we, through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.",
    "Galatians 5:6": "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision amounts to anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love.",
    "Galatians 5:7": "You were running well! Who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth?",
    "Galatians 5:8": "This persuasion is not from him who calls you.",
    "Galatians 5:9": "A little yeast grows through the whole lump.",
    "Galatians 5:10": "I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way. But he who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he is.",
    "Galatians 5:11": "But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed.",
    "Galatians 5:12": "I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off.",
    "Galatians 5:13": "For you, brothers, were called for freedom. Only don’t use your freedom for gain to the flesh, but through love be servants to one another.",
    "Galatians 5:14": "For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”",
    "Galatians 5:15": "But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you don’t consume one another.",
    "Galatians 5:16": "But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you won’t fulfill the lust of the flesh.",
    "Galatians 5:17": "For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, that you may not do the things that you desire.",
    "Galatians 5:18": "But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.",
    "Galatians 5:19": "Now the works of the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness,",
    "Galatians 5:20": "idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies,",
    "Galatians 5:21": "envyings, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God.",
    "Galatians 5:22": "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,",
    "Galatians 5:23": "gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.",
    "Galatians 5:24": "Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.",
    "Galatians 5:25": "If we live by the Spirit, let’s also walk by the Spirit.",
    "Galatians 5:26": "Let’s not become conceited, provoking one another, and envying one another.",
    "Galatians 6:1": "Brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to yourself so that you also aren’t tempted.",
    "Galatians 6:2": "Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.",
    "Galatians 6:3": "For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.",
    "Galatians 6:4": "But let each man test his own work, and then he will take pride in himself and not in his neighbor.",
    "Galatians 6:5": "For each man will bear his own burden.",
    "Galatians 6:6": "But let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches.",
    "Galatians 6:7": "Don’t be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.",
    "Galatians 6:8": "For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.",
    "Galatians 6:9": "Let us not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season, if we don’t give up.",
    "Galatians 6:10": "So then, as we have opportunity, let’s do what is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith.",
    "Galatians 6:11": "See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand.",
    "Galatians 6:12": "As many as desire to look good in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.",
    "Galatians 6:13": "For even they who receive circumcision don’t keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.",
    "Galatians 6:14": "But far be it from me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.",
    "Galatians 6:15": "For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.",
    "Galatians 6:16": "As many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on God’s Israel.",
    "Galatians 6:17": "From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body.",
    "Galatians 6:18": "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.",
    "Ephesians 1:1": "Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, to the saints who are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus:",
    "Ephesians 1:2": "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "Ephesians 1:3": "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ;",
    "Ephesians 1:4": "even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and without blemish before him in love;",
    "Ephesians 1:5": "having predestined us for adoption as children through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his desire,",
    "Ephesians 1:6": "to the praise of the glory of his grace, by which he freely bestowed favor on us in the Beloved,",
    "Ephesians 1:7": "in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace,",
    "Ephesians 1:8": "which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,",
    "Ephesians 1:9": "making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him",
    "Ephesians 1:10": "to an administration of the fullness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things on the earth, in him;",
    "Ephesians 1:11": "in whom also we were assigned an inheritance, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will;",

    "Ephesians 1:13": "in whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the Good News of your salvation—in whom, having also believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,",
    "Ephesians 1:14": "who is a pledge of our inheritance, to the redemption of God’s own possession, to the praise of his glory.",
    "Ephesians 1:15": "For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and the love which you have toward all the saints,",
    "Ephesians 1:16": "don’t cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,",
    "Ephesians 1:17": "that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him;",
    "Ephesians 1:18": "having the eyes of your hearts enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,",
    "Ephesians 1:19": "and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might",
    "Ephesians 1:20": "which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places,",
    "Ephesians 1:21": "far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is to come.",
    "Ephesians 1:22": "He put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things for the assembly,",
    "Ephesians 1:23": "which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.",
    "Ephesians 2:1": "You were made alive when you were dead in transgressions and sins,",
    "Ephesians 2:2": "in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the children of disobedience;",
    "Ephesians 2:3": "among whom we also all once lived in the lust of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.",
    "Ephesians 2:4": "But God, being rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us,",
    "Ephesians 2:5": "even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),",
    "Ephesians 2:6": "and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,",
    "Ephesians 2:7": "that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus;",
    "Ephesians 2:8": "for by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,",
    "Ephesians 2:9": "not of works, that no one would boast.",
    "Ephesians 2:10": "For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared before that we would walk in them.",
    "Ephesians 2:11": "Therefore remember that once you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called “uncircumcision” by that which is called “circumcision,” (in the flesh, made by hands);",
    "Ephesians 2:12": "that you were at that time separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.",
    "Ephesians 2:13": "But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off are made near in the blood of Christ.",
    "Ephesians 2:14": "For he is our peace, who made both one, and broke down the middle wall of partition,",
    "Ephesians 2:15": "having abolished in the flesh the hostility, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man of the two, making peace;",
    "Ephesians 2:16": "and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, having killed the hostility thereby.",
    "Ephesians 2:17": "He came and preached peace to you who were far off and to those who were near.",
    "Ephesians 2:18": "For through him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.",
    "Ephesians 2:19": "So then you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God,",
    "Ephesians 2:20": "being built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief cornerstone;",
    "Ephesians 2:21": "in whom the whole building, fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord;",
    "Ephesians 2:22": "in whom you also are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit.",
    "Ephesians 3:1": "For this cause I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles,",
    "Ephesians 3:2": "if it is so that you have heard of the administration of that grace of God which was given me toward you;",
    "Ephesians 3:3": "how that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I wrote before in few words,",
    "Ephesians 3:4": "by which, when you read, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ;",
    "Ephesians 3:5": "which in other generations was not made known to the children of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;",
    "Ephesians 3:6": "that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of his promise in Christ Jesus through the Good News,",
    "Ephesians 3:7": "of which I was made a servant, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power.",
    "Ephesians 3:8": "To me, the very least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,",
    "Ephesians 3:9": "and to make all men see what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God, who created all things through Jesus Christ;",
    "Ephesians 3:10": "to the intent that now through the assembly the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places,",
    "Ephesians 3:11": "according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord;",
    "Ephesians 3:12": "in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.",
    "Ephesians 3:13": "Therefore I ask that you may not lose heart at my troubles for you, which are your glory.",

    "Ephesians 3:17": "that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that you, being rooted and grounded in love,",
    "Ephesians 3:18": "may be strengthened to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,",
    "Ephesians 3:19": "and to know Christ’s love which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.",
    "Ephesians 3:20": "Now to him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,",
    "Ephesians 3:21": "to him be the glory in the assembly and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen.",
    "Ephesians 4:1": "I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beg you to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called,",
    "Ephesians 4:2": "with all lowliness and humility, with patience, bearing with one another in love;",
    "Ephesians 4:3": "being eager to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.",

    "Ephesians 4:6": "one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in us all.",
    "Ephesians 4:7": "But to each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.",
    "Ephesians 4:8": "Therefore he says, “When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.”",
    "Ephesians 4:9": "Now this, “He ascended,” what is it but that he also first descended into the lower parts of the earth?",
    "Ephesians 4:10": "He who descended is the one who also ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.",
    "Ephesians 4:11": "He gave some to be apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, shepherds and teachers;",
    "Ephesians 4:12": "for the perfecting of the saints, to the work of serving, to the building up of the body of Christ;",
    "Ephesians 4:13": "until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a full grown man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;",
    "Ephesians 4:14": "that we may no longer be children, tossed back and forth and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error;",
    "Ephesians 4:15": "but speaking truth in love, we may grow up in all things into him, who is the head, Christ;",
    "Ephesians 4:16": "from whom all the body, being fitted and knit together through that which every joint supplies, according to the working in measure of each individual part, makes the body increase to the building up of itself in love.",
    "Ephesians 4:17": "This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,",
    "Ephesians 4:18": "being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their hearts;",
    "Ephesians 4:19": "who having become callous gave themselves up to lust, to work all uncleanness with greediness.",
    "Ephesians 4:20": "But you did not learn Christ that way;",
    "Ephesians 4:21": "if indeed you heard him, and were taught in him, even as truth is in Jesus:",
    "Ephesians 4:22": "that you put away, as concerning your former way of life, the old man, that grows corrupt after the lusts of deceit;",
    "Ephesians 4:23": "and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,",
    "Ephesians 4:24": "and put on the new man, who in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of truth.",
    "Ephesians 4:25": "Therefore, putting away falsehood, speak truth each one with his neighbor. For we are members of one another.",
    "Ephesians 4:26": "“Be angry, and don’t sin.” Don’t let the sun go down on your wrath,",
    "Ephesians 4:27": "neither give place to the devil.",
    "Ephesians 4:28": "Let him who stole steal no more; but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have something to give to him who has need.",
    "Ephesians 4:29": "Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth, but such as is good for building up as the need may be, that it may give grace to those who hear.",
    "Ephesians 4:30": "Don’t grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.",
    "Ephesians 4:31": "Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, outcry, and slander, be put away from you, with all malice.",
    "Ephesians 4:32": "And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, just as God also in Christ forgave you.",
    "Ephesians 5:1": "Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children.",
    "Ephesians 5:2": "Walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling fragrance.",
    "Ephesians 5:3": "But sexual immorality, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be mentioned among you, as becomes saints;",
    "Ephesians 5:4": "nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not appropriate; but rather giving of thanks.",
    "Ephesians 5:5": "Know this for sure, that no sexually immoral person, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God.",
    "Ephesians 5:6": "Let no one deceive you with empty words. For because of these things, the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience.",
    "Ephesians 5:7": "Therefore don’t be partakers with them.",
    "Ephesians 5:8": "For you were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,",
    "Ephesians 5:9": "for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth,",
    "Ephesians 5:10": "proving what is well pleasing to the Lord.",
    "Ephesians 5:11": "Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them.",
    "Ephesians 5:12": "For the things which are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.",
    "Ephesians 5:13": "But all things, when they are reproved, are revealed by the light, for everything that reveals is light.",
    "Ephesians 5:14": "Therefore he says, “Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.”",
    "Ephesians 5:15": "Therefore watch carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise;",
    "Ephesians 5:16": "redeeming the time, because the days are evil.",
    "Ephesians 5:17": "Therefore don’t be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.",
    "Ephesians 5:18": "Don’t be drunken with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,",
    "Ephesians 5:19": "speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; singing, and making melody in your heart to the Lord;",
    "Ephesians 5:20": "giving thanks always concerning all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God, even the Father;",
    "Ephesians 5:21": "subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.",
    "Ephesians 5:22": "Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.",
    "Ephesians 5:23": "For the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ also is the head of the assembly, being himself the savior of the body.",
    "Ephesians 5:24": "But as the assembly is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their own husbands in everything.",
    "Ephesians 5:25": "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the assembly, and gave himself up for it;",
    "Ephesians 5:26": "that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,",
    "Ephesians 5:27": "that he might present the assembly to himself gloriously, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.",
    "Ephesians 5:28": "Even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself.",
    "Ephesians 5:29": "For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord also does the assembly;",
    "Ephesians 5:30": "because we are members of his body, of his flesh and bones.",
    "Ephesians 5:31": "“For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will be joined to his wife. The two will become one flesh.”",
    "Ephesians 5:32": "This mystery is great, but I speak concerning Christ and of the assembly.",
    "Ephesians 5:33": "Nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she respects her husband.",
    "Ephesians 6:1": "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.",
