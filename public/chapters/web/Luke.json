    "Malachi 1:1": "An oracle: the word of Yahweh to Israel by Malachi.",
    "Malachi 1:2": "“I have loved you,” says Yahweh. Yet you say, “How have you loved us?” “Wasn’t Esau Jacob’s brother?” says Yahweh, “Yet I loved Jacob;",
    "Malachi 1:3": "but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and gave his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness.”",
    "Malachi 1:4": "Whereas Edom says, “We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places;” thus says Yahweh of Armies, “They shall build, but I will throw down; and men will call them ‘The Wicked Land,’ even the people against whom Yahweh shows wrath forever.”",
    "Malachi 1:5": "Your eyes will see, and you will say, “Yahweh is great—even beyond the border of Israel!”",
    "Malachi 1:6": "“A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If I am a father, then where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is the respect due me? Says Yahweh of Armies to you, priests, who despise my name. You say, ‘How have we despised your name?’",
    "Malachi 1:7": "You offer polluted bread on my altar. You say, ‘How have we polluted you?’ In that you say, ‘Yahweh’s table contemptible.’",
    "Malachi 1:8": "When you offer the blind for sacrifice, isn’t that evil? And when you offer the lame and sick, isn’t that evil? Present it now to your governor! Will he be pleased with you? Or will he accept your person?” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 1:9": "“Now, please entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us. With this, will he accept any of you?” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 1:10": "“Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might not kindle fire on my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you,” says Yahweh of Armies, “neither will I accept an offering at your hand.",
    "Malachi 1:11": "For from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same, my name is great among the nations, and in every place incense will be offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name is great among the nations,” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 1:12": "“But you profane it, in that you say, ‘Yahweh’s table is polluted, and its fruit, even its food, is contemptible.’",
    "Malachi 1:13": "You say also, ‘Behold, what a weariness it is!’ and you have sniffed at it,” says Yahweh of Armies; “and you have brought that which was taken by violence, the lame, and the sick; thus you bring the offering. Should I accept this at your hand?” says Yahweh.",
    "Malachi 1:14": "“But the deceiver is cursed, who has in his flock a male, and vows, and sacrifices to the Lord a blemished thing; for I am a great King,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and my name is awesome among the nations.”",
    "Malachi 2:1": "“Now, you priests, this commandment is for you.",
    "Malachi 2:2": "If you will not listen, and if you will not lay it to heart, to give glory to my name,” says Yahweh of Armies, “then will I send the curse on you, and I will curse your blessings. Indeed, I have cursed them already, because you do not lay it to heart.",
    "Malachi 2:3": "Behold, I will rebuke your seed, and will spread dung on your faces, even the dung of your feasts; and you will be taken away with it.",
    "Malachi 2:4": "You will know that I have sent this commandment to you, that my covenant may be with Levi,” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 2:5": "“My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him that he might be reverent toward me; and he was reverent toward me, and stood in awe of my name.",
    "Malachi 2:6": "The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity.",
    "Malachi 2:7": "For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 2:8": "But you have turned aside out of the way. You have caused many to stumble in the law. You have corrupted the covenant of Levi,” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 2:9": "“Therefore I have also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according to the way you have not kept my ways, but have had respect for persons in the law.",
    "Malachi 2:10": "Don’t we all have one father? Hasn’t one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?",
    "Malachi 2:11": "Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the holiness of Yahweh which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.",
    "Malachi 2:12": "Yahweh will cut off, to the man who does this, him who wakes and him who answers, out of the tents of Jacob, and him who offers an offering to Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 2:13": "This again you do: you cover the altar of Yahweh with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, because he doesn’t regard the offering any more, neither receives it with good will at your hand.",
    "Malachi 2:14": "Yet you say, ‘Why?’ Because Yahweh has been witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously, though she is your companion, and the wife of your covenant.",
    "Malachi 2:15": "Did he not make you one, although he had the residue of the Spirit? Why one? He sought a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let no one deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.",
    "Malachi 2:16": "For I hate divorce,” says Yahweh, the God of Israel, “and him who covers his garment with violence!” says Yahweh of Armies. “Therefore take heed to your spirit, that you don’t deal treacherously.",
    "Malachi 2:17": "You have wearied Yahweh with your words. Yet you say, ‘How have we wearied him?’ In that you say, ‘Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of Yahweh, and he delights in them;’ or ‘Where is the God of justice?’",
    "Malachi 3:1": "“Behold, I send my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me; and the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, behold, he comes!” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 3:2": "“But who can endure the day of his coming? And who will stand when he appears? For he is like a refiner’s fire, and like launderer’s soap;",
    "Malachi 3:3": "and he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and silver; and they shall offer to Yahweh offerings in righteousness.",
    "Malachi 3:4": "Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasant to Yahweh, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.",
    "Malachi 3:5": "I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against the perjurers, and against those who oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and who deprive the foreigner of justice, and don’t fear me,” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 3:6": "“For I, Yahweh, don’t change; therefore you, sons of Jacob, are not consumed.",
    "Malachi 3:7": "From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from my ordinances, and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you,” says Yahweh of Armies. “But you say, ‘How shall we return?’",
    "Malachi 3:8": "Will a man rob God? Yet you rob me! But you say, ‘How have we robbed you?’ In tithes and offerings.",
    "Malachi 3:9": "You are cursed with the curse; for you rob me, even this whole nation.",
    "Malachi 3:10": "Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house, and test me now in this,” says Yahweh of Armies, “if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough for.",
    "Malachi 3:11": "I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before its time in the field,” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 3:12": "“All nations shall call you blessed, for you will be a delightful land,” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 3:13": "“Your words have been stout against me,” says Yahweh. “Yet you say, ‘What have we spoken against you?’",
    "Malachi 3:14": "You have said, ‘It is vain to serve God;’ and ‘What profit is it that we have followed his instructions, and that we have walked mournfully before Yahweh of Armies?",
    "Malachi 3:15": "Now we call the proud happy; yes, those who work wickedness are built up; yes, they tempt God, and escape.’",
    "Malachi 3:16": "Then those who feared Yahweh spoke one with another; and Yahweh listened, and heard, and a book of memory was written before him, for those who feared Yahweh, and who honored his name.",
    "Malachi 3:17": "They shall be mine,” says Yahweh of Armies, “my own possession in the day that I make, and I will spare them, as a man spares his own son who serves him.",
    "Malachi 3:18": "Then you shall return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him who serves God and him who doesn’t serve him.",
    "Malachi 4:1": "“For, behold, the day comes, it burns as a furnace; and all the proud, and all who work wickedness, will be stubble; and the day that comes will burn them up,” says Yahweh of Armies, “that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.",
    "Malachi 4:2": "But to you who fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings. You will go out, and leap like calves of the stall.",
    "Malachi 4:3": "You shall tread down the wicked; for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I make,” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 4:4": "“Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded to him in Horeb for all Israel, even statutes and ordinances.",
    "Malachi 4:5": "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of Yahweh comes.",
    "Malachi 4:6": "He will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the earth with a curse.”",

    "Mark 6:49": "but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;",
    "Mark 6:50": "for they all saw him, and were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them, and said to them, “Cheer up! It is I! Don’t be afraid.”",
    "Mark 6:51": "He got into the boat with them; and the wind ceased, and they were very amazed among themselves, and marveled;",
    "Mark 6:52": "for they hadn’t understood about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.",
    "Mark 6:53": "When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore.",
    "Mark 6:54": "When they had come out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him,",
    "Mark 6:55": "and ran around that whole region, and began to bring those who were sick, on their mats, to where they heard he was.",
    "Mark 6:56": "Wherever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might touch just the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched him were made well.",
    "Mark 7:1": "Then the Pharisees, and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem.",
    "Mark 7:2": "Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is, unwashed, hands, they found fault.",

    "Mark 7:8": "“For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men—the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things.”",
    "Mark 7:9": "He said to them, “Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.",
    "Mark 7:10": "For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother;’ and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’",
    "Mark 7:11": "But you say, ‘If a man tells his father or his mother, “Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban, that is to say, given to God;”’",
    "Mark 7:12": "then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,",

    "Mark 7:14": "He called all the multitude to himself, and said to them, “Hear me, all of you, and understand.",
    "Mark 7:15": "There is nothing from outside of the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.",
    "Mark 7:16": "If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!”",
    "Mark 7:17": "When he had entered into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable.",
    "Mark 7:18": "He said to them, “Are you thus without understanding also? Don’t you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can’t defile him,",
    "Mark 7:19": "because it doesn’t go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, thus purifying all foods?”",
    "Mark 7:20": "He said, “That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.",
    "Mark 7:21": "For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts,",
    "Mark 7:22": "covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness.",
    "Mark 7:23": "All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.”",
    "Mark 7:24": "From there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house, and didn’t want anyone to know it, but he couldn’t escape notice.",
    "Mark 7:25": "For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.",
    "Mark 7:26": "Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.",
    "Mark 7:27": "But Jesus said to her, “Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”",
    "Mark 7:28": "But she answered him, “Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”",

    "Mark 7:33": "He took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue.",
    "Mark 7:34": "Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, “Ephphatha!” that is, “Be opened!”",
    "Mark 7:35": "Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly.",
    "Mark 7:36": "He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it.",

    "Mark 8:3": "If I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way, for some of them have come a long way.”",
    "Mark 8:4": "His disciples answered him, “From where could one satisfy these people with bread here in a deserted place?”",
    "Mark 8:5": "He asked them, “How many loaves do you have?” They said, “Seven.”",
    "Mark 8:6": "He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground, and he took the seven loaves. Having given thanks, he broke them, and gave them to his disciples to serve, and they served the multitude.",
    "Mark 8:7": "They had a few small fish. Having blessed them, he said to serve these also.",
    "Mark 8:8": "They ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over.",
    "Mark 8:9": "Those who had eaten were about four thousand. Then he sent them away.",
    "Mark 8:10": "Immediately he entered into the boat with his disciples, and came into the region of Dalmanutha.",
    "Mark 8:11": "The Pharisees came out and began to question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, and testing him.",
    "Mark 8:12": "He sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, “Why does this generation seek a sign? Most certainly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation.”",
    "Mark 8:13": "He left them, and again entering into the boat, departed to the other side.",
    "Mark 8:14": "They forgot to take bread; and they didn’t have more than one loaf in the boat with them.",

    "Mark 8:16": "They reasoned with one another, saying, “It’s because we have no bread.”",
    "Mark 8:17": "Jesus, perceiving it, said to them, “Why do you reason that it’s because you have no bread? Don’t you perceive yet, neither understand? Is your heart still hardened?",
    "Mark 8:18": "Having eyes, don’t you see? Having ears, don’t you hear? Don’t you remember?",

    "Mark 8:20": "“When the seven loaves fed the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?” They told him, “Seven.”",
    "Mark 8:21": "He asked them, “Don’t you understand, yet?”",
    "Mark 8:22": "He came to Bethsaida. They brought a blind man to him, and begged him to touch him.",
    "Mark 8:23": "He took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village. When he had spit on his eyes, and laid his hands on him, he asked him if he saw anything.",
    "Mark 8:24": "He looked up, and said, “I see men; for I see them like trees walking.”",
    "Mark 8:25": "Then again he laid his hands on his eyes. He looked intently, and was restored, and saw everyone clearly.",

    "Mark 8:32": "He spoke to them openly. Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.",
    "Mark 8:33": "But he, turning around, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and said, “Get behind me, Satan! For you have in mind not the things of God, but the things of men.”",
    "Mark 8:34": "He called the multitude to himself with his disciples, and said to them, “Whoever wants to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.",
    "Mark 8:35": "For whoever wants to save his life will lose it; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Good News will save it.",
    "Mark 8:36": "For what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life?",
    "Mark 8:37": "For what will a man give in exchange for his life?",
    "Mark 8:38": "For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.”",

    "Mark 9:10": "They kept this saying to themselves, questioning what the “rising from the dead” meant.",
    "Mark 9:11": "They asked him, saying, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”",
    "Mark 9:12": "He said to them, “Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things. How is it written about the Son of Man, that he should suffer many things and be despised?",

    "Mark 9:45": "If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life lame, rather than having your two feet to be cast into Gehenna, into the fire that will never be quenched—",

    "Luke 7:49": "Those who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”",
    "Luke 7:50": "He said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”",
    "Luke 8:1": "It happened soon afterwards, that he went about through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the good news of the Kingdom of God. With him were the twelve,",
    "Luke 8:2": "and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out;",
    "Luke 8:3": "and Joanna, the wife of Chuzas, Herod’s steward; Susanna; and many others; who served them from their possessions.",
    "Luke 8:4": "When a great multitude came together, and people from every city were coming to him, he spoke by a parable.",
    "Luke 8:5": "“The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell along the road, and it was trampled under foot, and the birds of the sky devoured it.",
    "Luke 8:6": "Other seed fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture.",
    "Luke 8:7": "Other fell amid the thorns, and the thorns grew with it, and choked it.",
    "Luke 8:8": "Other fell into the good ground, and grew, and brought forth fruit one hundred times.” As he said these things, he called out, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear!”",
    "Luke 8:9": "Then his disciples asked him, “What does this parable mean?”",
    "Luke 8:10": "He said, “To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables; that ‘seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.’",
    "Luke 8:11": "Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.",
    "Luke 8:12": "Those along the road are those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.",
    "Luke 8:13": "Those on the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root, who believe for a while, then fall away in time of temptation.",
    "Luke 8:14": "That which fell among the thorns, these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity.",
    "Luke 8:15": "That in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it tightly, and bring forth fruit with patience.",
    "Luke 8:16": "“No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a container, or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a stand, that those who enter in may see the light.",
    "Luke 8:17": "For nothing is hidden, that will not be revealed; nor anything secret, that will not be known and come to light.",
    "Luke 8:18": "Be careful therefore how you hear. For whoever has, to him will be given; and whoever doesn’t have, from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has.”",
    "Luke 8:19": "His mother and brothers came to him, and they could not come near him for the crowd.",
    "Luke 8:20": "It was told him by some saying, “Your mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see you.”",
    "Luke 8:21": "But he answered them, “My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God, and do it.”",
    "Luke 8:22": "Now it happened on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples, and he said to them, “Let’s go over to the other side of the lake.” So they launched out.",
    "Luke 8:23": "But as they sailed, he fell asleep. A wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water.",
    "Luke 8:24": "They came to him, and awoke him, saying, “Master, master, we are dying!” He awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it was calm.",
    "Luke 8:25": "He said to them, “Where is your faith?” Being afraid they marveled, saying one to another, “Who is this, then, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?”",
    "Luke 8:26": "They arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.",
    "Luke 8:27": "When Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met him. He wore no clothes, and didn’t live in a house, but in the tombs.",
    "Luke 8:28": "When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, “What do I have to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torment me!”",
    "Luke 8:29": "For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. He was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bands apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert.",
    "Luke 8:30": "Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” He said, “Legion,” for many demons had entered into him.",
    "Luke 8:31": "They begged him that he would not command them to go into the abyss.",
    "Luke 8:32": "Now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those. He allowed them.",
    "Luke 8:33": "The demons came out from the man, and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and were drowned.",
    "Luke 8:34": "When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.",
    "Luke 8:35": "People went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.",
    "Luke 8:36": "Those who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was healed.",
    "Luke 8:37": "All the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very much afraid. He entered into the boat, and returned.",
    "Luke 8:38": "But the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,",
    "Luke 8:39": "“Return to your house, and declare what great things God has done for you.” He went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.",
    "Luke 8:40": "It happened, when Jesus returned, that the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.",
    "Luke 8:41": "Behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus’ feet, and begged him to come into his house,",
    "Luke 8:42": "for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the multitudes pressed against him.",
    "Luke 8:43": "A woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, and could not be healed by any,",
    "Luke 8:44": "came behind him, and touched the fringe of his cloak, and immediately the flow of her blood stopped.",
    "Luke 8:45": "Jesus said, “Who touched me?” When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, “Master, the multitudes press and jostle you, and you say, ‘Who touched me?’”",
    "Luke 8:46": "But Jesus said, “Someone did touch me, for I perceived that power has gone out of me.”",
    "Luke 8:47": "When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.",
    "Luke 8:48": "He said to her, “Daughter, cheer up. Your faith has made you well. Go in peace.”",
    "Luke 8:49": "While he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house came, saying to him, “Your daughter is dead. Don’t trouble the Teacher.”",
    "Luke 8:50": "But Jesus hearing it, answered him, “Don’t be afraid. Only believe, and she will be healed.”",
    "Luke 8:51": "When he came to the house, he didn’t allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, John, James, the father of the child, and her mother.",
    "Luke 8:52": "All were weeping and mourning her, but he said, “Don’t weep. She isn’t dead, but sleeping.”",
    "Luke 8:53": "They were ridiculing him, knowing that she was dead.",
    "Luke 8:54": "But he put them all outside, and taking her by the hand, he called, saying, “Child, arise!”",
    "Luke 8:55": "Her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat.",
    "Luke 8:56": "Her parents were amazed, but he commanded them to tell no one what had been done.",
    "Luke 9:1": "He called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.",
    "Luke 9:2": "He sent them forth to preach the Kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.",
    "Luke 9:3": "He said to them, “Take nothing for your journey—neither staffs, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats apiece.",
    "Luke 9:4": "Into whatever house you enter, stay there, and depart from there.",
    "Luke 9:5": "As many as don’t receive you, when you depart from that city, shake off even the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.”",
    "Luke 9:6": "They departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the Good News, and healing everywhere.",
    "Luke 9:7": "Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him; and he was very perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,",
    "Luke 9:8": "and by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again.",
    "Luke 9:9": "Herod said, “John I beheaded, but who is this, about whom I hear such things?” He sought to see him.",
    "Luke 9:10": "The apostles, when they had returned, told him what things they had done. He took them, and withdrew apart to a deserted place of a city called Bethsaida.",
    "Luke 9:11": "But the multitudes, perceiving it, followed him. He welcomed them, and spoke to them of the Kingdom of God, and he cured those who needed healing.",
    "Luke 9:12": "The day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said to him, “Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and lodge, and get food, for we are here in a deserted place.”",
    "Luke 9:13": "But he said to them, “You give them something to eat.” They said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we should go and buy food for all these people.”",
    "Luke 9:14": "For they were about five thousand men. He said to his disciples, “Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”",
    "Luke 9:15": "They did so, and made them all sit down.",
    "Luke 9:16": "He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, he blessed them, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude.",
    "Luke 9:17": "They ate, and were all filled. They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over.",
    "Luke 9:18": "It happened, as he was praying alone, that the disciples were with him, and he asked them, “Who do the multitudes say that I am?”",
    "Luke 9:19": "They answered, “‘John the Baptizer,’ but others say, ‘Elijah,’ and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again.”",
    "Luke 9:20": "He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered, “The Christ of God.”",
    "Luke 9:21": "But he warned them, and commanded them to tell this to no one,",
    "Luke 9:22": "saying, “The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.”",
    "Luke 9:23": "He said to all, “If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.",
    "Luke 9:24": "For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life for my sake, the same will save it.",
    "Luke 9:25": "For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits his own self?",
    "Luke 9:26": "For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes in his glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels.",

    "Luke 9:33": "It happened, as they were parting from him, that Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah,” not knowing what he said.",
    "Luke 9:34": "While he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.",
    "Luke 9:35": "A voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!”",
    "Luke 9:36": "When the voice came, Jesus was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.",
    "Luke 9:37": "It happened on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, that a great multitude met him.",
    "Luke 9:38": "Behold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.",
    "Luke 9:39": "Behold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams, and it hardly departs from him, bruising him severely.",
    "Luke 9:40": "I begged your disciples to cast it out, and they couldn’t.”",
    "Luke 9:41": "Jesus answered, “Faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.”",
    "Luke 9:42": "While he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.",
    "Luke 9:43": "They were all astonished at the majesty of God. But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,",
    "Luke 9:44": "“Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men.”",
    "Luke 9:45": "But they didn’t understand this saying. It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.",
    "Luke 9:46": "There arose an argument among them about which of them was the greatest.",
    "Luke 9:47": "Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their hearts, took a little child, and set him by his side,",
    "Luke 9:48": "and said to them, “Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me. Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For whoever is least among you all, this one will be great.”",
    "Luke 9:49": "John answered, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he doesn’t follow with us.”",
    "Luke 9:50": "Jesus said to him, “Don’t forbid him, for he who is not against us is for us.”",
    "Luke 9:51": "It came to pass, when the days were near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem,",
    "Luke 9:52": "and sent messengers before his face. They went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, so as to prepare for him.",
    "Luke 9:53": "They didn’t receive him, because he was traveling with his face set towards Jerusalem.",
    "Luke 9:54": "When his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky, and destroy them, just as Elijah did?”",
    "Luke 9:55": "But he turned and rebuked them, “You don’t know of what kind of spirit you are.",
    "Luke 9:56": "For the Son of Man didn’t come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them.” They went to another village.",
    "Luke 9:57": "As they went on the way, a certain man said to him, “I want to follow you wherever you go, Lord.”",
    "Luke 9:58": "Jesus said to him, “The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”",
    "Luke 9:59": "He said to another, “Follow me!” But he said, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.”",
    "Luke 9:60": "But Jesus said to him, “Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and announce the Kingdom of God.”",
    "Luke 9:61": "Another also said, “I want to follow you, Lord, but first allow me to say good-bye to those who are at my house.”",
    "Luke 9:62": "But Jesus said to him, “No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of God.”",

    "Luke 10:21": "In that same hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, “I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.”",
    "Luke 10:22": "Turning to the disciples, he said, “All things have been delivered to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is, except the Father, and who the Father is, except the Son, and he to whomever the Son desires to reveal him.”",
    "Luke 10:23": "Turning to the disciples, he said privately, “Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see,",
