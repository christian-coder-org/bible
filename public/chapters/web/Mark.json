    "Malachi 1:1": "An oracle: the word of Yahweh to Israel by Malachi.",
    "Malachi 1:2": "“I have loved you,” says Yahweh. Yet you say, “How have you loved us?” “Wasn’t Esau Jacob’s brother?” says Yahweh, “Yet I loved Jacob;",
    "Malachi 1:3": "but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and gave his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness.”",
    "Malachi 1:4": "Whereas Edom says, “We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places;” thus says Yahweh of Armies, “They shall build, but I will throw down; and men will call them ‘The Wicked Land,’ even the people against whom Yahweh shows wrath forever.”",
    "Malachi 1:5": "Your eyes will see, and you will say, “Yahweh is great—even beyond the border of Israel!”",
    "Malachi 1:6": "“A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If I am a father, then where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is the respect due me? Says Yahweh of Armies to you, priests, who despise my name. You say, ‘How have we despised your name?’",
    "Malachi 1:7": "You offer polluted bread on my altar. You say, ‘How have we polluted you?’ In that you say, ‘Yahweh’s table contemptible.’",
    "Malachi 1:8": "When you offer the blind for sacrifice, isn’t that evil? And when you offer the lame and sick, isn’t that evil? Present it now to your governor! Will he be pleased with you? Or will he accept your person?” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 1:9": "“Now, please entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us. With this, will he accept any of you?” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 1:10": "“Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might not kindle fire on my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you,” says Yahweh of Armies, “neither will I accept an offering at your hand.",
    "Malachi 1:11": "For from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same, my name is great among the nations, and in every place incense will be offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name is great among the nations,” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 1:12": "“But you profane it, in that you say, ‘Yahweh’s table is polluted, and its fruit, even its food, is contemptible.’",
    "Malachi 1:13": "You say also, ‘Behold, what a weariness it is!’ and you have sniffed at it,” says Yahweh of Armies; “and you have brought that which was taken by violence, the lame, and the sick; thus you bring the offering. Should I accept this at your hand?” says Yahweh.",
    "Malachi 1:14": "“But the deceiver is cursed, who has in his flock a male, and vows, and sacrifices to the Lord a blemished thing; for I am a great King,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and my name is awesome among the nations.”",
    "Malachi 2:1": "“Now, you priests, this commandment is for you.",
    "Malachi 2:2": "If you will not listen, and if you will not lay it to heart, to give glory to my name,” says Yahweh of Armies, “then will I send the curse on you, and I will curse your blessings. Indeed, I have cursed them already, because you do not lay it to heart.",
    "Malachi 2:3": "Behold, I will rebuke your seed, and will spread dung on your faces, even the dung of your feasts; and you will be taken away with it.",
    "Malachi 2:4": "You will know that I have sent this commandment to you, that my covenant may be with Levi,” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 2:5": "“My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him that he might be reverent toward me; and he was reverent toward me, and stood in awe of my name.",
    "Malachi 2:6": "The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity.",
    "Malachi 2:7": "For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 2:8": "But you have turned aside out of the way. You have caused many to stumble in the law. You have corrupted the covenant of Levi,” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 2:9": "“Therefore I have also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according to the way you have not kept my ways, but have had respect for persons in the law.",
    "Malachi 2:10": "Don’t we all have one father? Hasn’t one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?",
    "Malachi 2:11": "Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the holiness of Yahweh which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.",
    "Malachi 2:12": "Yahweh will cut off, to the man who does this, him who wakes and him who answers, out of the tents of Jacob, and him who offers an offering to Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 2:13": "This again you do: you cover the altar of Yahweh with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, because he doesn’t regard the offering any more, neither receives it with good will at your hand.",
    "Malachi 2:14": "Yet you say, ‘Why?’ Because Yahweh has been witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously, though she is your companion, and the wife of your covenant.",
    "Malachi 2:15": "Did he not make you one, although he had the residue of the Spirit? Why one? He sought a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let no one deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.",
    "Malachi 2:16": "For I hate divorce,” says Yahweh, the God of Israel, “and him who covers his garment with violence!” says Yahweh of Armies. “Therefore take heed to your spirit, that you don’t deal treacherously.",
    "Malachi 2:17": "You have wearied Yahweh with your words. Yet you say, ‘How have we wearied him?’ In that you say, ‘Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of Yahweh, and he delights in them;’ or ‘Where is the God of justice?’",
    "Malachi 3:1": "“Behold, I send my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me; and the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, behold, he comes!” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 3:2": "“But who can endure the day of his coming? And who will stand when he appears? For he is like a refiner’s fire, and like launderer’s soap;",
    "Malachi 3:3": "and he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and silver; and they shall offer to Yahweh offerings in righteousness.",
    "Malachi 3:4": "Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasant to Yahweh, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.",
    "Malachi 3:5": "I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against the perjurers, and against those who oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and who deprive the foreigner of justice, and don’t fear me,” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 3:6": "“For I, Yahweh, don’t change; therefore you, sons of Jacob, are not consumed.",
    "Malachi 3:7": "From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from my ordinances, and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you,” says Yahweh of Armies. “But you say, ‘How shall we return?’",
    "Malachi 3:8": "Will a man rob God? Yet you rob me! But you say, ‘How have we robbed you?’ In tithes and offerings.",
    "Malachi 3:9": "You are cursed with the curse; for you rob me, even this whole nation.",
    "Malachi 3:10": "Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house, and test me now in this,” says Yahweh of Armies, “if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough for.",
    "Malachi 3:11": "I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before its time in the field,” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 3:12": "“All nations shall call you blessed, for you will be a delightful land,” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 3:13": "“Your words have been stout against me,” says Yahweh. “Yet you say, ‘What have we spoken against you?’",
    "Malachi 3:14": "You have said, ‘It is vain to serve God;’ and ‘What profit is it that we have followed his instructions, and that we have walked mournfully before Yahweh of Armies?",
    "Malachi 3:15": "Now we call the proud happy; yes, those who work wickedness are built up; yes, they tempt God, and escape.’",
    "Malachi 3:16": "Then those who feared Yahweh spoke one with another; and Yahweh listened, and heard, and a book of memory was written before him, for those who feared Yahweh, and who honored his name.",
    "Malachi 3:17": "They shall be mine,” says Yahweh of Armies, “my own possession in the day that I make, and I will spare them, as a man spares his own son who serves him.",
    "Malachi 3:18": "Then you shall return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him who serves God and him who doesn’t serve him.",
    "Malachi 4:1": "“For, behold, the day comes, it burns as a furnace; and all the proud, and all who work wickedness, will be stubble; and the day that comes will burn them up,” says Yahweh of Armies, “that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.",
    "Malachi 4:2": "But to you who fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings. You will go out, and leap like calves of the stall.",
    "Malachi 4:3": "You shall tread down the wicked; for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I make,” says Yahweh of Armies.",
    "Malachi 4:4": "“Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded to him in Horeb for all Israel, even statutes and ordinances.",
    "Malachi 4:5": "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of Yahweh comes.",
    "Malachi 4:6": "He will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the earth with a curse.”",

    "Mark 6:49": "but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;",
    "Mark 6:50": "for they all saw him, and were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them, and said to them, “Cheer up! It is I! Don’t be afraid.”",
    "Mark 6:51": "He got into the boat with them; and the wind ceased, and they were very amazed among themselves, and marveled;",
    "Mark 6:52": "for they hadn’t understood about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.",
    "Mark 6:53": "When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore.",
    "Mark 6:54": "When they had come out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him,",
    "Mark 6:55": "and ran around that whole region, and began to bring those who were sick, on their mats, to where they heard he was.",
    "Mark 6:56": "Wherever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might touch just the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched him were made well.",
    "Mark 7:1": "Then the Pharisees, and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem.",
    "Mark 7:2": "Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is, unwashed, hands, they found fault.",

    "Mark 7:8": "“For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men—the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things.”",
    "Mark 7:9": "He said to them, “Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.",
    "Mark 7:10": "For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother;’ and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’",
    "Mark 7:11": "But you say, ‘If a man tells his father or his mother, “Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban, that is to say, given to God;”’",
    "Mark 7:12": "then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,",

    "Mark 7:14": "He called all the multitude to himself, and said to them, “Hear me, all of you, and understand.",
    "Mark 7:15": "There is nothing from outside of the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.",
    "Mark 7:16": "If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!”",
    "Mark 7:17": "When he had entered into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable.",
    "Mark 7:18": "He said to them, “Are you thus without understanding also? Don’t you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can’t defile him,",
    "Mark 7:19": "because it doesn’t go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, thus purifying all foods?”",
    "Mark 7:20": "He said, “That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.",
    "Mark 7:21": "For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts,",
    "Mark 7:22": "covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness.",
    "Mark 7:23": "All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.”",
    "Mark 7:24": "From there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house, and didn’t want anyone to know it, but he couldn’t escape notice.",
    "Mark 7:25": "For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.",
    "Mark 7:26": "Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.",
    "Mark 7:27": "But Jesus said to her, “Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”",
    "Mark 7:28": "But she answered him, “Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”",

    "Mark 7:33": "He took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue.",
    "Mark 7:34": "Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, “Ephphatha!” that is, “Be opened!”",
    "Mark 7:35": "Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly.",
    "Mark 7:36": "He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it.",

    "Mark 8:3": "If I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way, for some of them have come a long way.”",
    "Mark 8:4": "His disciples answered him, “From where could one satisfy these people with bread here in a deserted place?”",
    "Mark 8:5": "He asked them, “How many loaves do you have?” They said, “Seven.”",
    "Mark 8:6": "He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground, and he took the seven loaves. Having given thanks, he broke them, and gave them to his disciples to serve, and they served the multitude.",
    "Mark 8:7": "They had a few small fish. Having blessed them, he said to serve these also.",
    "Mark 8:8": "They ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over.",
    "Mark 8:9": "Those who had eaten were about four thousand. Then he sent them away.",
    "Mark 8:10": "Immediately he entered into the boat with his disciples, and came into the region of Dalmanutha.",
    "Mark 8:11": "The Pharisees came out and began to question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, and testing him.",
    "Mark 8:12": "He sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, “Why does this generation seek a sign? Most certainly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation.”",
    "Mark 8:13": "He left them, and again entering into the boat, departed to the other side.",
    "Mark 8:14": "They forgot to take bread; and they didn’t have more than one loaf in the boat with them.",

    "Mark 8:16": "They reasoned with one another, saying, “It’s because we have no bread.”",
    "Mark 8:17": "Jesus, perceiving it, said to them, “Why do you reason that it’s because you have no bread? Don’t you perceive yet, neither understand? Is your heart still hardened?",
    "Mark 8:18": "Having eyes, don’t you see? Having ears, don’t you hear? Don’t you remember?",

    "Mark 8:20": "“When the seven loaves fed the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?” They told him, “Seven.”",
    "Mark 8:21": "He asked them, “Don’t you understand, yet?”",
    "Mark 8:22": "He came to Bethsaida. They brought a blind man to him, and begged him to touch him.",
    "Mark 8:23": "He took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village. When he had spit on his eyes, and laid his hands on him, he asked him if he saw anything.",
    "Mark 8:24": "He looked up, and said, “I see men; for I see them like trees walking.”",
    "Mark 8:25": "Then again he laid his hands on his eyes. He looked intently, and was restored, and saw everyone clearly.",

    "Mark 8:32": "He spoke to them openly. Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.",
    "Mark 8:33": "But he, turning around, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and said, “Get behind me, Satan! For you have in mind not the things of God, but the things of men.”",
    "Mark 8:34": "He called the multitude to himself with his disciples, and said to them, “Whoever wants to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.",
    "Mark 8:35": "For whoever wants to save his life will lose it; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Good News will save it.",
    "Mark 8:36": "For what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life?",
    "Mark 8:37": "For what will a man give in exchange for his life?",
    "Mark 8:38": "For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.”",

    "Mark 9:10": "They kept this saying to themselves, questioning what the “rising from the dead” meant.",
    "Mark 9:11": "They asked him, saying, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”",
    "Mark 9:12": "He said to them, “Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things. How is it written about the Son of Man, that he should suffer many things and be despised?",

    "Mark 9:45": "If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life lame, rather than having your two feet to be cast into Gehenna, into the fire that will never be quenched—",
