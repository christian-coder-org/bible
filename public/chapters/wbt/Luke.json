    "Malachi 1:1": "The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.",
    "Malachi 1:2": "I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, In what hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob’s brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,",
    "Malachi 1:3": "And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.",
    "Malachi 1:4": "Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.",
    "Malachi 1:5": "And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel.",
    "Malachi 1:6": "A son honoreth his father, and a servant his master: if then I am a father, where is my honor? and if I am a master, where is my fear? saith the LORD of hosts to you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, In what have we despised thy name?",
    "Malachi 1:7": "Ye offer polluted bread upon my altar? and ye say, In what have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD is contemptible.",
    "Malachi 1:8": "And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now to thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.",
    "Malachi 1:9": "And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious to us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your person? saith the LORD of hosts.",
    "Malachi 1:10": "Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought? neither do ye kindle fire on my altar for naught. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.",
    "Malachi 1:11": "For from the rising of the sun even to the setting of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts.",
    "Malachi 1:12": "But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD is polluted; and the fruit of it, even his provision, is contemptible.",
    "Malachi 1:13": "Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this from your hand? saith the LORD.",
    "Malachi 1:14": "But cursed be the deceiver, who hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth to the Lord a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen.",
    "Malachi 2:1": "And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.",
    "Malachi 2:2": "If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory to my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings; yes, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart.",
    "Malachi 2:3": "Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take you away with it.",
    "Malachi 2:4": "And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment to you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.",
    "Malachi 2:5": "My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear with which he feared me, and was afraid before my name.",
    "Malachi 2:6": "The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and turned many away from iniquity.",
    "Malachi 2:7": "For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.",
    "Malachi 2:8": "But ye have departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.",
    "Malachi 2:9": "Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.",
    "Malachi 2:10": "Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?",
    "Malachi 2:11": "Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the LORD whom he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god.",
    "Malachi 2:12": "The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering to the LORD of hosts.",
    "Malachi 2:13": "And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth it with good will at your hand.",
    "Malachi 2:14": "Yet ye say, Why? Because the LORD hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.",
    "Malachi 2:15": "And did he not make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And why one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.",
    "Malachi 2:16": "For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith, that he hateth putting away: for one covereth violence with his garment, saith the LORD of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.",
    "Malachi 2:17": "Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, In what have we wearied him? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of judgment?",
    "Malachi 3:1": "Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, will suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he will come, saith the LORD of hosts.",
    "Malachi 3:2": "But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner’s fire, and like fuller’s soap.",
    "Malachi 3:3": "And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer to the LORD an offering in righteousness.",
    "Malachi 3:4": "Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant to the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.",
    "Malachi 3:5": "And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.",
    "Malachi 3:6": "For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.",
    "Malachi 3:7": "Even from the days of your fathers ye have gone away from my ordinances, and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, In what shall we return?",
    "Malachi 3:8": "Will a man rob God? yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, In what have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.",
    "Malachi 3:9": "Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.",
    "Malachi 3:10": "Bring ye all the tithes into the store-house, that there may be food in my house, and prove me now with this, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.",
    "Malachi 3:11": "And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.",
    "Malachi 3:12": "And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.",
    "Malachi 3:13": "Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, What have we spoken so much against thee?",
    "Malachi 3:14": "Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hosts?",
    "Malachi 3:15": "And now we call the proud happy; yes, they that work wickedness are set up; even they that tempt God are delivered.",
    "Malachi 3:16": "Then they that feared the LORD spoke often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.",
    "Malachi 3:17": "And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.",
    "Malachi 3:18": "Then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.",
    "Malachi 4:1": "For behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.",
    "Malachi 4:2": "But to you that fear my name, shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.",
    "Malachi 4:3": "And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of hosts.",
    "Malachi 4:4": "Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded to him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments.",
    "Malachi 4:5": "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:",
    "Malachi 4:6": "And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.",
    "Matthew 1:1": "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.",
    "Matthew 1:2": "Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren;",
    "Matthew 1:3": "And Judah begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;",

    "Matthew 14:2": "And said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he hath risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.",
    "Matthew 14:3": "For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife.",
    "Matthew 14:4": "For John had said to him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.",
    "Matthew 14:5": "And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.",

    "Mark 4:27": "And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.",
    "Mark 4:28": "For the earth bringeth forth fruit of itself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.",
    "Mark 4:29": "But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.",
    "Mark 4:30": "And he said, To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?",
    "Mark 4:31": "It is like a grain of mustard-seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth.",

    "Mark 4:38": "And he was in the hinder part of the boat, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say to him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?",
    "Mark 4:39": "And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace, be still: and the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.",
    "Mark 4:40": "And he said to them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?",
    "Mark 4:41": "And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?",
    "Mark 5:1": "And they came over to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.",
    "Mark 5:2": "And when he had come out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,",
    "Mark 5:3": "Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:",
    "Mark 5:4": "For he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.",
    "Mark 5:5": "And always, night and day, he was on the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.",
    "Mark 5:6": "But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshiped him,",
    "Mark 5:7": "And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.",
    "Mark 5:8": "(For he said to him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.)",
    "Mark 5:9": "And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.",
    "Mark 5:10": "And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.",
    "Mark 5:11": "Now there was there nigh to the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.",
    "Mark 5:12": "And all the demons besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.",
    "Mark 5:13": "And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea (they were about two thousand) and were choked in the sea.",
    "Mark 5:14": "And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.",
    "Mark 5:15": "And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the demon, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.",
    "Mark 5:16": "And they that saw it told them how it befell him that was possessed with the demon, and also concerning the swine.",
    "Mark 5:17": "And they began to pray him to depart out of their borders.",
    "Mark 5:18": "And when he had come into the boat, he that had been possessed with the demon prayed him that he might be with him.",
    "Mark 5:19": "Yet Jesus suffered him not, but saith to him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.",
    "Mark 5:20": "And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him. And all men wondered.",
    "Mark 5:21": "And when Jesus had passed over again in a boat to the other side, much people gathered to him: and he was nigh to the sea.",
    "Mark 5:22": "And behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,",
    "Mark 5:23": "And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she will live.",
    "Mark 5:24": "And Jesus went with him; and many people followed him, and thronged him.",
    "Mark 5:25": "And a certain woman who had an issue of blood twelve years,",
    "Mark 5:26": "And had suffered many things from many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was not relieved, but rather grew worse,",
    "Mark 5:27": "When she had heard of Jesus, came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment.",
    "Mark 5:28": "For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.",
    "Mark 5:29": "And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that infirmity.",
    "Mark 5:30": "And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the throng, and said, Who touched my clothes?",
    "Mark 5:31": "And his disciples said to him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?",
    "Mark 5:32": "And he looked around, to see her that had done this thing.",
    "Mark 5:33": "But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.",
    "Mark 5:34": "And he said to her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be healed of thy infirmity.",
    "Mark 5:35": "While he was yet speaking, there came from the ruler of the synagogue’s house certain who said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?",
    "Mark 5:36": "As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith to the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe,",
    "Mark 5:37": "And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.",
    "Mark 5:38": "And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.",
    "Mark 5:39": "And when he had come in, he saith to them, Why make ye this tumult, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.",
    "Mark 5:40": "And they derided him: but when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.",
    "Mark 5:41": "And he took the damsel by the hand, and said to her, Talitha cumi: which is, being interpreted, Damsel (I say to thee) arise.",
    "Mark 5:42": "And forthwith the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.",
    "Mark 5:43": "And he charged them strictly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.",
    "Mark 6:1": "And he went out from thence, and came into his own country, and his disciples follow him.",
    "Mark 6:2": "And when the sabbath was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given to him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?",
    "Mark 6:3": "Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.",
    "Mark 6:4": "But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, but in his own country, and among his own kindred, and in his own house.",
    "Mark 6:5": "And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick persons, and healed them.",
    "Mark 6:6": "And he marveled because of their unbelief. And he went around the villages teaching.",
    "Mark 6:7": "And he calleth to him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;",
    "Mark 6:8": "And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no bag, no bread, no money in their purse:",
    "Mark 6:9": "But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.",
    "Mark 6:10": "And he said to them, In whatever place ye enter into a house, there abide till ye depart from that place.",
    "Mark 6:11": "And whoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence shake off the dust under your feet, for a testimony against them. Verily I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.",
    "Mark 6:12": "And they went out and preached that men should repent.",
    "Mark 6:13": "And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.",
    "Mark 6:14": "And king Herod heard of him (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist had risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.",
    "Mark 6:15": "Others said, That it is Elijah. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.",
    "Mark 6:16": "But when Herod heard of him, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he hath risen from the dead.",
    "Mark 6:17": "For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife: for he had married her.",
    "Mark 6:18": "For John had said to Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother’s wife.",
    "Mark 6:19": "Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:",
    "Mark 6:20": "For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just and holy man, and observed him: and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.",
    "Mark 6:21": "And when a convenient day had come, that Herod on his birth-day made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief men of Galilee;",

    "Mark 6:24": "And she went forth, and said to her mother, What shall I ask? and she said, The head of John the Baptist.",
    "Mark 6:25": "And she came in forthwith with haste to the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou shouldst give me, immediately, in a dish, the head of John the Baptist.",
    "Mark 6:26": "And the king was exceeding sorry: yet for his oath’s sake, and for their sakes who sat with him, he would not reject her.",
    "Mark 6:27": "And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,",
    "Mark 6:28": "And brought his head in a dish, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.",
    "Mark 6:29": "And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.",
    "Mark 6:30": "And the apostles assembled themselves to Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.",
    "Mark 6:31": "And he said to them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.",
    "Mark 6:32": "And they departed into a desert place in a boat privately.",
    "Mark 6:33": "And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran on foot thither out of all cities, and out went them, and came together to him.",
    "Mark 6:34": "And Jesus, when he came out, saw many people, and was moved with compassion towards them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.",

    "Mark 6:36": "Send them away, that they may go into the country around, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.",
    "Mark 6:37": "He answered and said to them, Give ye them to eat. And they say to him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?",
    "Mark 6:38": "He saith to them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.",
    "Mark 6:39": "And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.",
    "Mark 6:40": "And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.",
    "Mark 6:41": "And when he had taken the five loaves, and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes he divided among them all.",
    "Mark 6:42": "And they all ate, and were satisfied.",
    "Mark 6:43": "And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.",
    "Mark 6:44": "And they that ate of the loaves, were about five thousand men.",
    "Mark 6:45": "And immediately he constrained his disciples to get into the boat, and to go to the other side before to Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.",
    "Mark 6:46": "And when he had dismissed them, he departed to a mountain to pray.",
    "Mark 6:47": "And when evening was come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.",
    "Mark 6:48": "And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary to them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh to them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.",
    "Mark 6:49": "But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out.",
    "Mark 6:50": "(For they all saw him, and were troubled.) And immediately he talked with them, and saith to them, Be of good cheer: It is I; be not afraid.",
    "Mark 6:51": "And he went up to them into the boat; and the wind ceased: and they were greatly amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.",
    "Mark 6:52": "For they considered not the miracle of the loaves; for their heart was hardened.",
    "Mark 6:53": "And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.",
    "Mark 6:54": "And when they had come out of the boat forthwith they knew him,",
    "Mark 6:55": "And ran through that whole region around, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.",
    "Mark 6:56": "And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch, if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him, were healed.",
    "Mark 7:1": "Then came together to him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, who came from Jerusalem.",
    "Mark 7:2": "And when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled (that is to say with unwashed) hands, they found fault.",
    "Mark 7:3": "For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands often eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.",
    "Mark 7:4": "And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there are, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, and of brazen vessels, and tables.",
    "Mark 7:5": "Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?",
    "Mark 7:6": "He answered and said to them, Well hath Isaiah prophesied concerning you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoreth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.",
    "Mark 7:7": "But, in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.",
    "Mark 7:8": "For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.",
    "Mark 7:9": "And he said to them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition,",
    "Mark 7:10": "For Moses said, Honor thy father and thy mother; and, Whoever curseth father or mother, let him die the death:",
    "Mark 7:11": "But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.",
    "Mark 7:12": "And ye suffer him no more to do aught for his father or his mother;",
    "Mark 7:13": "Making the word of God of no effect through your traditions, which ye have delivered: and many such like things ye do.",
    "Mark 7:14": "And when he had called all the people to him, he said to them, Hearken to me every one of you, and understand.",
    "Mark 7:15": "There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him, can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.",
    "Mark 7:16": "If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear.",
    "Mark 7:17": "And when he had entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.",
    "Mark 7:18": "And he saith to them, Are ye so void of understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him.",
    "Mark 7:19": "Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all kinds of food.",
    "Mark 7:20": "And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.",
    "Mark 7:21": "For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,",
    "Mark 7:22": "Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness;",
    "Mark 7:23": "All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.",
    "Mark 7:24": "And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into a house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.",
    "Mark 7:25": "For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:",
    "Mark 7:26": "(The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation,) and she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter.",
    "Mark 7:27": "But Jesus said to her, Let the children first be satisfied: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it to the dogs.",
    "Mark 7:28": "And she answered and said to him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crums.",
    "Mark 7:29": "And he said to her, For this saying, depart; the demon is gone out of thy daughter.",
    "Mark 7:30": "And when she had come to her house, she found the demon had gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.",
    "Mark 7:31": "And again, departing from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis.",
    "Mark 7:32": "And they bring to him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.",
    "Mark 7:33": "And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue.",
    "Mark 7:34": "And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith to him, Effatha, that is, Be opened.",
    "Mark 7:35": "And immediately his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plain.",
    "Mark 7:36": "And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them; so much the more a great deal they published it;",
    "Mark 7:37": "And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well; he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.",
    "Mark 8:1": "In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples, and saith to them,",
    "Mark 8:2": "I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:",
    "Mark 8:3": "And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for some of them came from a distance.",
    "Mark 8:4": "And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?",
    "Mark 8:5": "And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.",
    "Mark 8:6": "And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and broke, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they set them before the people.",
    "Mark 8:7": "And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them.",
    "Mark 8:8": "So they ate, and were satisfied: and they took up of the fragments that were left, seven baskets.",
    "Mark 8:9": "And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he dismissed them.",
    "Mark 8:10": "And forthwith he entered into a boat with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.",
    "Mark 8:11": "And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, tempting him.",
    "Mark 8:12": "And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek for a sign? Verily I say to you, There shall no sign be given to this generation.",
    "Mark 8:13": "And he left them, and entering into the boat again, departed to the other side.",
    "Mark 8:14": "Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the boat with them more than one loaf.",
    "Mark 8:15": "And he charged them saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.",
    "Mark 8:16": "And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread.",
    "Mark 8:17": "And when Jesus knew it, he saith to them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?",
    "Mark 8:18": "Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?",
    "Mark 8:19": "When I divided the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say to him, Twelve.",
    "Mark 8:20": "And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.",
    "Mark 8:21": "And he said to them, How is it that ye do not understand?",
    "Mark 8:22": "And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man to him, and besought him to touch him.",
    "Mark 8:23": "And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw aught.",
    "Mark 8:24": "And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees walking.",
    "Mark 8:25": "After that, he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.",
    "Mark 8:26": "And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.",
    "Mark 8:27": "And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Cesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am?",
    "Mark 8:28": "And they answered, John the Baptist: but some say, Elijah; and others, One of the prophets,",
    "Mark 8:29": "And he saith to them, But who say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith to him, Thou art the Christ.",
    "Mark 8:30": "And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.",
    "Mark 8:31": "And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.",
    "Mark 8:32": "And he spoke that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.",
    "Mark 8:33": "But when he had turned about, and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savorest not the things that are of God, but the things that are of men.",
    "Mark 8:34": "And when he had called the people to him with his disciples also, he said to them, Whoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.",
    "Mark 8:35": "For whoever will save his life, shall lose it; but whoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, the same shall save it.",
    "Mark 8:36": "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul:",
    "Mark 8:37": "Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?",
    "Mark 8:38": "Whoever therefore shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also will the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.",
    "Mark 9:1": "And he said to them, Verily I say to you, that there are some of them that stand here who shall not taste death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.",
    "Mark 9:2": "And after six days, Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up upon a high mountain apart by themselves; and he was transfigured before them.",
    "Mark 9:3": "And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can whiten them.",
    "Mark 9:4": "And there appeared to them Elijah, with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.",
    "Mark 9:5": "And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.",
    "Mark 9:6": "For he knew not what to say: for they were greatly terrified.",
    "Mark 9:7": "And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.",
    "Mark 9:8": "And suddenly, when they had looked around, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.",
    "Mark 9:9": "And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.",
    "Mark 9:10": "And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean.",
    "Mark 9:11": "And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elijah must first come?",
    "Mark 9:12": "And he answered and told them, Elijah verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written concerning the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at naught.",
    "Mark 9:13": "But I say to you, that Elijah is indeed come, and they have done to him whatever they pleased, as it is written concerning him.",
    "Mark 9:14": "And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them.",
    "Mark 9:15": "And immediately all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him, saluted him.",
    "Mark 9:16": "And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?",
    "Mark 9:17": "And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought to thee my son, who hath a dumb spirit;",
    "Mark 9:18": "And wherever he taketh him, he teareth him; and he foameth and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away; and I spoke to thy disciples that they should cast him out, and they could not.",
    "Mark 9:19": "He answered him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you, how long shall I suffer you? bring him to me.",
    "Mark 9:20": "And they brought him to him: and when he saw him, immediately the spirit tore him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed, foaming.",
    "Mark 9:21": "And he asked his father, How long is it since this came to him? and he said, From a child.",
    "Mark 9:22": "And often it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.",
    "Mark 9:23": "Jesus said to him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.",
    "Mark 9:24": "And immediately the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou my unbelief.",
    "Mark 9:25": "When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying to him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.",
    "Mark 9:26": "And the spirit cried, and rent him severely, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; so that many said, He is dead.",
    "Mark 9:27": "But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.",
    "Mark 9:28": "And when he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?",
    "Mark 9:29": "And he said to them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.",
    "Mark 9:30": "And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it.",
    "Mark 9:31": "For he taught his disciples, and said to them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him; and after that he is killed, he will rise the third day.",
    "Mark 9:32": "But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.",
    "Mark 9:33": "And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house, he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?",
    "Mark 9:34": "But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest.",
    "Mark 9:35": "And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith to them, If any man desireth to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all.",
    "Mark 9:36": "And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said to them,",
    "Mark 9:37": "Whoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.",
    "Mark 9:38": "And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name, and he followeth not us; and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.",
    "Mark 9:39": "But Jesus said, Forbid him not; for there is no man who shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.",
    "Mark 9:40": "For he that is not against us, is on our part.",
    "Mark 9:41": "For whoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.",
    "Mark 9:42": "And whoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe in me, to fall into sin, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.",
    "Mark 9:43": "And if thy hand causeth thee to fall into sin, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:",
    "Mark 9:44": "Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.",
    "Mark 9:45": "And if thy foot causeth thee to fall into sin, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:",
    "Mark 9:46": "Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.",
    "Mark 9:47": "And if thy eye causeth thee to fall into sin, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes, to be cast into hell-fire.",
    "Mark 9:48": "Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.",
    "Mark 9:49": "For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.",
    "Mark 9:50": "Salt is good: but if the salt hath lost its saltness, with what will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.",
    "Mark 10:1": "And he arose from thence, and cometh into the borders of Judea, by the further side of Jordan: and the people resort to him again; and, as he was accustomed, he taught them again.",
    "Mark 10:2": "And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.",
    "Mark 10:3": "And he answered and said to them, What did Moses command you?",
    "Mark 10:4": "And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.",
    "Mark 10:5": "And Jesus answered and said to them, For the hardness of your heart, he wrote you this precept.",
    "Mark 10:6": "But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.",
    "Mark 10:7": "For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;",
    "Mark 10:8": "And they two shall be one flesh: so then they are no more two, but one flesh.",
    "Mark 10:9": "What therefore God hath joined together, let not man separate.",
    "Mark 10:10": "And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter.",
    "Mark 10:11": "And he saith to them, Whoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her.",
    "Mark 10:12": "And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.",
    "Mark 10:13": "And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them; and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.",
    "Mark 10:14": "But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said to them, Suffer the little children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.",
    "Mark 10:15": "Verily I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God, as a little child, he shall not enter it.",
    "Mark 10:16": "And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.",
    "Mark 10:17": "And when he had gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?",
    "Mark 10:18": "And Jesus said to him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good, but one, that is God.",
    "Mark 10:19": "Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honor thy father and mother.",
    "Mark 10:20": "And he answered and said to him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.",
    "Mark 10:21": "Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said to him, One thing thou lackest: go, sell whatever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, take up the cross, and follow me.",
    "Mark 10:22": "And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.",
    "Mark 10:23": "And Jesus looked around, and saith to his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!",
    "Mark 10:24": "And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith to them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!",
    "Mark 10:25": "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.",
    "Mark 10:26": "And they were astonished beyond measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?",
    "Mark 10:27": "And Jesus looking upon them, saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.",
    "Mark 10:28": "Then Peter began to say to him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.",
    "Mark 10:29": "Jesus answered and said, Verily I say to you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel’s,",
    "Mark 10:30": "But he shall receive a hundred-fold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come, eternal life.",
    "Mark 10:31": "But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.",
    "Mark 10:32": "And they were in the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen to him,",
    "Mark 10:33": "Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests, and to the scribes; and they will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles;",
    "Mark 10:34": "And they will mock him, and will scourge him, and will spit upon him, and will kill him: and the third day he will rise again.",
    "Mark 10:35": "And James and John the sons of Zebedee come to him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatever we shall desire.",
    "Mark 10:36": "And he said to them, What would ye that I should do for you?",
    "Mark 10:37": "They said to him, Grant to us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.",
    "Mark 10:38": "But Jesus said to them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?",
    "Mark 10:39": "And they said to him, We can. And Jesus said to them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of: and with the baptism that I am baptized with shalt ye be baptized;",
    "Mark 10:40": "But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand, is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.",
    "Mark 10:41": "And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.",
    "Mark 10:42": "But Jesus called them, and saith to them, Ye know that they who are accounted to rule over the Gentiles, exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.",
    "Mark 10:43": "But so it shall not be among you: but whoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:",
    "Mark 10:44": "And whoever of you will be the chief, shall be servant of all.",
    "Mark 10:45": "For even the son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.",
    "Mark 10:46": "And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples, and a great number of people, blind Bartimeus, the son of Timeus, sat by the highway-side begging.",
    "Mark 10:47": "And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.",

    "Mark 13:11": "But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, be not anxious beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Spirit.",

    "Mark 13:19": "For in those days shall be affliction, such as hath not been from the beginning of the creation which God created to this time, neither shall be.",
    "Mark 13:20": "And except the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh would be saved: but for the elect’s sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.",
    "Mark 13:21": "And then, if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or lo, he is there; believe him not.",
    "Mark 13:22": "For false Christs, and false prophets will rise, and will show signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.",

    "Mark 13:32": "But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.",
    "Mark 13:33": "Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.",
    "Mark 13:34": "For the son of man is as a man taking a long journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work; and commanded the porter to watch.",
    "Mark 13:35": "Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at evening, or at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning:",

    "Mark 14:4": "And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?",
    "Mark 14:5": "For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.",
    "Mark 14:6": "And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.",
    "Mark 14:7": "For ye have the poor with you always, and whenever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.",
    "Mark 14:8": "She hath done what she could: she is come beforehand to anoint my body to the burying.",
    "Mark 14:9": "Verily I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of, for a memorial of her.",

    "Mark 14:19": "And they began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?",
    "Mark 14:20": "And he answered and said to them, It is one of the twelve that dippeth with me in the dish.",
    "Mark 14:21": "The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written concerning him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.",

    "Luke 9:55": "But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.",
    "Luke 9:56": "For the Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.",
    "Luke 9:57": "And it came to pass, that as they were going in the way, a certain man said to him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.",

    "Luke 17:4": "And if he shall trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day shall turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.",
    "Luke 17:5": "And the apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith.",
    "Luke 17:6": "And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard-seed, ye might say to this sycamine-tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it would obey you.",
    "Luke 17:7": "But which of you having a servant plowing, or feeding cattle, will say to him immediately, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to eat?",

    "Luke 17:28": "Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;",
    "Luke 17:29": "But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all:",
    "Luke 17:30": "Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.",
    "Luke 17:31": "In that day, he who shall be upon the house-top, and his furniture in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.",
    "Luke 17:32": "Remember Lot’s wife.",

    "Luke 18:4": "And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;",
    "Luke 18:5": "Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.",
    "Luke 18:6": "And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.",
    "Luke 18:7": "And will not God avenge his own elect, who cry day and night to him, though he beareth long with them?",
    "Luke 18:8": "I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, will he find faith on the earth?",

    "Luke 18:23": "And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.",
    "Luke 18:24": "And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly will they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!",

    "Luke 18:26": "And they that heard it, said, Who then can be saved?",
    "Luke 18:27": "Then he said, The things which are impossible with men, are possible with God.",
    "Luke 18:28": "Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.",

    "Luke 20:3": "And he answered and said to them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:",
    "Luke 20:4": "The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?",
    "Luke 20:5": "And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?",
    "Luke 20:6": "But if we say, From men; all the people will stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.",
    "Luke 20:7": "And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.",
