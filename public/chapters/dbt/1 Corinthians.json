    "Malachi 1:1": "The burden of the word of Jehovah to Israel by Malachi.",
    "Malachi 1:2": "I have loved you, saith Jehovah; but ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob’s brother? saith Jehovah, and I loved Jacob,",
    "Malachi 1:3": "and I hated Esau; and made his mountains a desolation, and [gave] his inheritance to the jackals of the wilderness.",
    "Malachi 1:4": "If Edom say, We are broken down, but we will build again the ruined places,—thus saith Jehovah of hosts: They shall build, but I will throw down; and [men] shall call them the territory of wickedness, and the people against whom Jehovah hath indignation for ever.",
    "Malachi 1:5": "And your eyes shall see [it], and ye shall say, Jehovah is magnified beyond the border of Israel.",
    "Malachi 1:6": "A son honoureth [his] father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith Jehovah of hosts unto you, priests, that despise my name. But ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?",
    "Malachi 1:7": "Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of Jehovah is contemptible.",
    "Malachi 1:8": "And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? And if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? Present it now unto thy governor: will he be pleased with thee? or will he accept thy person? saith Jehovah of hosts.",
    "Malachi 1:9": "And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us. This hath been of your hand: will he accept any of your persons? saith Jehovah of hosts.",
    "Malachi 1:10": "Who is there among you that would even shut the doors? and ye would not kindle [fire] on mine altar for nothing. I have no delight in you, saith Jehovah of hosts, neither will I accept an oblation at your hand.",
    "Malachi 1:11": "For from the rising of the sun even unto its setting my name shall be great among the nations; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure oblation: for my name shall be great among the nations, saith Jehovah of hosts.",
    "Malachi 1:12": "But ye profane it, in that ye say, The table of the Lord is polluted; and the fruit thereof, his food, is contemptible.",
    "Malachi 1:13": "And ye say, Behold, what a weariness! And ye have puffed at it, saith Jehovah of hosts, and ye bring [that which was] torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye bring the oblation: should I accept this of your hand? saith Jehovah.",
    "Malachi 1:14": "Yea, cursed be the deceiver, who hath in his flock a male, and voweth and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing; for I am a great King, saith Jehovah of hosts, and my name is terrible among the nations.",
    "Malachi 2:1": "And now, ye priests, this commandment is for you.",
    "Malachi 2:2": "If ye do not hear, and if ye do not lay [it] to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith Jehovah of hosts, I will even send the curse among you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have already cursed them, because ye do not lay [it] to heart.",
    "Malachi 2:3": "Behold, I will rebuke your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, the dung of your feasts; and they shall take you away with it.",
    "Malachi 2:4": "And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith Jehovah of hosts.",
    "Malachi 2:5": "My covenant with him was of life and peace, and I gave them to him that he might fear; and he feared me, and trembled before my name.",
    "Malachi 2:6": "The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity.",
    "Malachi 2:7": "For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and at his mouth they seek the law; for he is the messenger of Jehovah of hosts.",
    "Malachi 2:8": "But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith Jehovah of hosts.",
    "Malachi 2:9": "And I also have made you contemptible and base before all the people, because ye have not kept my ways, but have respect of persons in [administering] the law.",
    "Malachi 2:10": "Have we not all one father? Hath not one God created us? Why do we deal unfaithfully every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?",
    "Malachi 2:11": "Judah hath dealt unfaithfully, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the sanctuary of Jehovah which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god.",
    "Malachi 2:12": "Jehovah will cut off from the tents of Jacob the man that doeth this, him that calleth and him that answereth; and him that offereth an oblation unto Jehovah of hosts.",
    "Malachi 2:13": "And further ye do this: ye cover the altar of Jehovah with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, insomuch that he regardeth not the oblation any more, nor receiveth [it] with satisfaction at your hand.",
    "Malachi 2:14": "Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because Jehovah hath been a witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt unfaithfully: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.",
    "Malachi 2:15": "And did not one make [them]? and the remnant of the Spirit was his. And wherefore the one? He sought a seed of God. Take heed then to your spirit, and let none deal unfaithfully against the wife of his youth,",
    "Malachi 2:16": "(for I hate putting away, saith Jehovah the God of Israel;) and he covereth with violence his garment, saith Jehovah of hosts: take heed then to your spirit, that ye deal not unfaithfully.",
    "Malachi 2:17": "Ye have wearied Jehovah with your words, and ye say, Wherein have we wearied [him]? In that ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of Jehovah, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of judgment?",
    "Malachi 3:1": "Behold, I send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me; and the Lord whom ye seek will suddenly come to his temple, and the Angel of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he cometh, saith Jehovah of hosts.",
    "Malachi 3:2": "But who shall endure the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? For he will be like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ lye.",
    "Malachi 3:3": "And he shall sit [as] a refiner and purifier of silver; and he will purify the children of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver; and they shall offer unto Jehovah an oblation in righteousness.",
    "Malachi 3:4": "Then shall the oblation of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in former years.",
    "Malachi 3:5": "And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against the false swearers, and against those that oppress the hired servant in [his] wages, the widow and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger [from his right], and fear not me, saith Jehovah of hosts.",
    "Malachi 3:6": "For I Jehovah change not, and ye, sons of Jacob, are not consumed.",
    "Malachi 3:7": "Since the days of your fathers have ye departed from my statutes, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith Jehovah of hosts. But ye say, Wherein shall we return?",
    "Malachi 3:8": "Will a man rob God? But ye rob me. And ye say, Wherein do we rob thee? [In] tithes and heave-offerings.",
    "Malachi 3:9": "Ye are cursed with a curse; and me ye rob, [even] this whole nation.",
    "Malachi 3:10": "Bring the whole tithe into the treasure-house, that there may be food in my house, and prove me now herewith, saith Jehovah of hosts, if I open not to you the windows of the heavens, and pour you out a blessing, till there be no place for it.",
    "Malachi 3:11": "And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before the time in the field, saith Jehovah of hosts.",
    "Malachi 3:12": "And all nations shall call you blessed; for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith Jehovah of hosts.",
    "Malachi 3:13": "Your words have been stout against me, saith Jehovah; but ye say, What have we been speaking against thee?",
    "Malachi 3:14": "Ye say, It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we keep his charge, and that we walk mournfully before Jehovah of hosts?",
    "Malachi 3:15": "And now we hold the proud for happy; yea, they that work wickedness are built up; yea, they tempt God, and they escape.",
    "Malachi 3:16": "Then they that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another; and Jehovah observed [it], and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared Jehovah, and that thought upon his name.",
    "Malachi 3:17": "And they shall be unto me a peculiar treasure, saith Jehovah of hosts, in the day that I prepare; and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.",
    "Malachi 3:18": "And ye shall return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.",
    "Malachi 4:1": "For behold, the day cometh, burning as a furnace; and all the proud and all that work wickedness shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith Jehovah of hosts, so that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.",
    "Malachi 4:2": "And unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth and leap like fatted calves.",
    "Malachi 4:3": "And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I prepare, saith Jehovah of hosts.",
    "Malachi 4:4": "Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, the statutes and ordinances.",
    "Malachi 4:5": "Behold, I send unto you Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and terrible day of Jehovah.",
    "Malachi 4:6": "And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.",

    "Matthew 1:19": "But Joseph, her husband, being [a] righteous [man], and unwilling to expose her publicly, purposed to have put her away secretly;",
    "Matthew 1:20": "but while he pondered on these things, behold, an angel of [the] Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, fear not to take to [thee] Mary, thy wife, for that which is begotten in her is of [the] Holy Spirit.",
    "Matthew 1:21": "And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.",

    "Matthew 5:36": "Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.",
    "Matthew 5:37": "But let your word be Yea, yea; Nay, nay; but what is more than these is from evil.",

    "Matthew 5:45": "that ye may be [the] sons of your Father who is in [the] heavens; for he makes his sun rise on evil and good, and sends rain on just and unjust.",
    "Matthew 5:46": "For if ye should love those who love you, what reward have ye? Do not also the tax-gatherers the same?",
    "Matthew 5:47": "And if ye should salute your brethren only, what do ye extraordinary? Do not also the Gentiles the same?",
    "Matthew 5:48": "Be ye therefore perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.",

    "Matthew 6:9": "Thus therefore pray ye: Our Father who art in the heavens, let thy name be sanctified,",
    "Matthew 6:10": "let thy kingdom come, let thy will be done as in heaven so upon the earth;",

    "Matthew 6:30": "But if God so clothe the herbage of the field, which is to-day, and to-morrow is cast into [the] oven, will he not much rather you, O [ye] of little faith?",
    "Matthew 6:31": "Be not therefore careful, saying, What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or What shall we put on?",
    "Matthew 6:32": "for all these things the nations seek after; for your heavenly Father knows that ye have need of all these things.",

    "Matthew 7:13": "Enter in through the narrow gate, for wide the gate and broad the way that leads to destruction, and many are they who enter in through it.",
    "Matthew 7:14": "For narrow the gate and straitened the way that leads to life, and they are few who find it.",
    "Matthew 7:15": "But beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but within are ravening wolves.",
    "Matthew 7:16": "By their fruits ye shall know them. Do [men] gather a bunch of grapes from thorns, or from thistles figs?",
    "Matthew 7:17": "So every good tree produces good fruits, but the worthless tree produces bad fruits.",
    "Matthew 7:18": "A good tree cannot produce bad fruits, nor a worthless tree produce good fruits.",

    "Matthew 8:9": "For I also am a man under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say to this [one], Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my bondman, Do this, and he does it.",
    "Matthew 8:10": "And when Jesus heard it, he wondered, and said to those who followed, Verily I say unto you, Not even in Israel have I found so great faith.",
    "Matthew 8:11": "But I say unto you, that many shall come from [the] rising and setting [sun], and shall lie down at table with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens;",
    "Matthew 8:12": "but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.",

    "Matthew 8:21": "But another of his disciples said to him, Lord, suffer me first to go away and bury my father.",
    "Matthew 8:22": "But Jesus said to him, Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.",
    "Matthew 8:23": "And he went on board ship and his disciples followed him;",
    "Matthew 8:24": "and behold, [the water] became very agitated on the sea, so that the ship was covered by the waves; but he slept.",
    "Matthew 8:25": "And the disciples came and awoke him, saying, Lord save: we perish.",

    "Matthew 11:11": "Verily I say to you, that there is not arisen among [the] born of women a greater than John the baptist. But he who is a little one in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.",
    "Matthew 11:12": "But from the days of John the baptist until now, the kingdom of the heavens is taken by violence, and [the] violent seize on it.",

    "Matthew 11:17": "say, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced: we have mourned to you, and ye have not wailed.",

    "Matthew 11:19": "The Son of man has come eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a man [that is] eating and wine-drinking, a friend of tax-gatherers, and of sinners:—and wisdom has been justified by her children.",
    "Matthew 11:20": "Then began he to reproach the cities in which most of his works of power had taken place, because they had not repented.",
    "Matthew 11:21": "Woe to thee, Chorazin! woe to thee Bethsaida! for if the works of power which have taken place in you, had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, they had long ago repented in sackcloth and ashes.",
    "Matthew 11:22": "But I say to you, that it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in judgment-day than for you.",
    "Matthew 11:23": "And thou, Capernaum, who hast been raised up to heaven, shalt be brought down even to hades. For if the works of power which have taken place in thee, had taken place in Sodom, it had remained until this day.",

    "Matthew 11:25": "At that time, Jesus answering said, I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes.",
    "Matthew 11:26": "Yea, Father, for thus has it been well-pleasing in thy sight.",
    "Matthew 11:27": "All things have been delivered to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son but the Father, nor does any one know the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son may be pleased to reveal [him].",

    "Matthew 12:2": "But the Pharisees, seeing [it], said to him, Behold, thy disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on sabbath.",
    "Matthew 12:3": "But he said to them, Have ye not read what David did when he was hungry, and they that were with him?",
    "Matthew 12:4": "How he entered into the house of God, and ate the shewbread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those with him, but for the priests only?",
    "Matthew 12:5": "Or have ye not read in the law that on the sabbaths the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?",
    "Matthew 12:6": "But I say unto you, that there is here what is greater than the temple.",
    "Matthew 12:7": "But if ye had known what is: I will have mercy and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.",
    "Matthew 12:8": "For the Son of man is Lord of the sabbath.",
    "Matthew 12:9": "And, going away from thence, he came into their synagogue.",
    "Matthew 12:10": "And behold, there was a man having his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath? that they might accuse him.",
    "Matthew 12:11": "But he said to them, What man shall there be of you who has one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the sabbath, will not lay hold of it and raise [it] up?",
    "Matthew 12:12": "How much better then is a man than a sheep! So that it is lawful to do well on the sabbath.",
    "Matthew 12:13": "Then he says to the man, Stretch out thy hand. And he stretched [it] out, and it was restored sound as the other.",
    "Matthew 12:14": "But the Pharisees, having gone out, took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.",
    "Matthew 12:15": "But Jesus knowing [it], withdrew thence, and great crowds followed him; and he healed them all:",
    "Matthew 12:16": "and charged them strictly that they should not make him publicly known:",
    "Matthew 12:17": "that that might be fulfilled which was spoken through Esaias the prophet, saying,",
    "Matthew 12:18": "Behold my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul has found its delight. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall shew forth judgment to the nations.",
    "Matthew 12:19": "He shall not strive or cry out, nor shall any one hear his voice in the streets;",

    "Matthew 12:25": "But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not subsist.",
    "Matthew 12:26": "And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom subsist?",
    "Matthew 12:27": "And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, your sons, by whom do they cast [them] out? For this reason they shall be your judges.",
    "Matthew 12:28": "But if I by [the] Spirit of God cast out demons, then indeed the kingdom of God is come upon you.",
    "Matthew 12:29": "Or how can any one enter into the house of the strong [man] and plunder his goods, unless first he bind the strong [man]? and then he will plunder his house.",

    "Matthew 12:38": "Then answered him some of the scribes and Pharisees, saying, Teacher, we desire to see a sign from thee.",
    "Matthew 12:39": "But he, answering, said to them, A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it save the sign of Jonas the prophet.",
    "Matthew 12:40": "For even as Jonas was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, thus shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.",
    "Matthew 12:41": "Ninevites shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and behold, more than Jonas [is] here.",
    "Matthew 12:42": "A queen of [the] south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, more than Solomon [is] here.",

    "Matthew 12:44": "Then he says, I will return to my house whence I came out; and having come, he finds [it] unoccupied, swept, and adorned.",
    "Matthew 12:45": "Then he goes and takes with himself seven other spirits worse than himself, and entering in, they dwell there; and the last condition of that man becomes worse than the first. Thus shall it be to this wicked generation also.",
    "Matthew 12:46": "But while he was yet speaking to the crowds, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him.",
    "Matthew 12:47": "Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren are standing without, seeking to speak to thee.",
    "Matthew 12:48": "But he answering said to him that spoke to him, Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?",
    "Matthew 12:49": "And, stretching out his hand to his disciples, he said, Behold my mother and my brethren;",
    "Matthew 12:50": "for whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in [the] heavens, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.",
    "Matthew 13:1": "And that [same] day Jesus went out from the house and sat down by the sea.",
    "Matthew 13:2": "And great crowds were gathered together to him, so that going on board ship himself he sat down, and the whole crowd stood on the shore.",
    "Matthew 13:3": "And he spoke to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went out to sow:",
    "Matthew 13:4": "and as he sowed, some [grains] fell along the way, and the birds came and devoured them;",
    "Matthew 13:5": "and others fell upon the rocky places where they had not much earth, and immediately they sprang up out of [the ground] because of not having [any] depth of earth,",
    "Matthew 13:6": "but when the sun rose they were burned up, and because of not having [any] root were dried up;",
    "Matthew 13:7": "and others fell upon the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them;",
    "Matthew 13:8": "and others fell upon the good ground, and produced fruit, one a hundred, one sixty, and one thirty.",
    "Matthew 13:9": "He that has ears, let him hear.",
    "Matthew 13:10": "And the disciples came up and said to him, Why speakest thou to them in parables?",
    "Matthew 13:11": "And he answering said to them, Because to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it is not given;",
    "Matthew 13:12": "for whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall be caused to be in abundance; but he who has not, even what he has shall be taken away from him.",
    "Matthew 13:13": "For this cause I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear nor understand;",
    "Matthew 13:14": "and in them is filled up the prophecy of Esaias, which says, Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand, and beholding ye shall behold and not see;",
    "Matthew 13:15": "for the heart of this people has grown fat, and they have heard heavily with their ears, and they have closed their eyes as asleep, lest they should see with the eyes, and hear with the ears, and understand with the heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.",
    "Matthew 13:16": "But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear;",
    "Matthew 13:17": "for verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous [men] have desired to see the things which ye behold and did not see [them], and to hear the things which ye hear and did not hear [them].",
    "Matthew 13:18": "Ye, therefore, hear the parable of the sower.",
    "Matthew 13:19": "From every one who hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand [it], the wicked one comes and catches away what was sown in his heart: this is he that is sown by the wayside.",
    "Matthew 13:20": "But he that is sown on the rocky places—this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy,",
    "Matthew 13:21": "but has no root in himself, but is for a time only; and when tribulation or persecution happens on account of the word, he is immediately offended.",
    "Matthew 13:22": "And he that is sown among the thorns—this is he who hears the word, and the anxious care of this life, and the deceit of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.",
    "Matthew 13:23": "But he that is sown upon the good ground—this is he who hears and understands the word, who bears fruit also, and produces, one a hundred, one sixty, and one thirty.",
    "Matthew 13:24": "Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field;",
    "Matthew 13:25": "but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel amongst the wheat, and went away.",
    "Matthew 13:26": "But when the blade shot up and produced fruit, then appeared the darnel also.",
    "Matthew 13:27": "And the bondmen of the householder came up and said to him, Sir, hast thou not sown good seed in thy field? whence then has it darnel?",
    "Matthew 13:28": "And he said to them, A man [that is] an enemy has done this. And the bondmen said to him, Wilt thou then that we should go and gather it [up]?",
    "Matthew 13:29": "But he said, No; lest [in] gathering the darnel ye should root up the wheat with it.",
    "Matthew 13:30": "Suffer both to grow together unto the harvest, and in time of the harvest I will say to the harvestmen, Gather first the darnel, and bind it into bundles to burn it; but the wheat bring together into my granary.",
    "Matthew 13:31": "Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a grain of mustard [seed] which a man took and sowed in his field;",
    "Matthew 13:32": "which is less indeed than all seeds, but when it is grown is greater than herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches.",
    "Matthew 13:33": "He spoke another parable to them: The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until it had been all leavened.",
    "Matthew 13:34": "All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and without a parable he did not speak to them,",
    "Matthew 13:35": "so that that should be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from [the] world’s foundation.",
    "Matthew 13:36": "Then, having dismissed the crowds, he went into the house; and his disciples came to him, saying, Expound to us the parable of the darnel of the field.",
    "Matthew 13:37": "But he answering said, He that sows the good seed is the Son of man,",
    "Matthew 13:38": "and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom, but the darnel are the sons of the evil [one];",
    "Matthew 13:39": "and the enemy who has sowed it is the devil; and the harvest is [the] completion of [the] age, and the harvestmen are angels.",
    "Matthew 13:40": "As then the darnel is gathered and is burned in the fire, thus it shall be in the completion of the age.",
    "Matthew 13:41": "The Son of man shall send his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all offences, and those that practise lawlessness;",
    "Matthew 13:42": "and they shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.",
    "Matthew 13:43": "Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that has ears, let him hear.",
    "Matthew 13:44": "The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hid in the field, which a man having found has hid, and for the joy of it goes and sells all whatever he has, and buys that field.",
    "Matthew 13:45": "Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls;",
    "Matthew 13:46": "and having found one pearl of great value, he went and sold all whatever he had and bought it.",
    "Matthew 13:47": "Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a seine which has been cast into the sea, and which has gathered together of every kind,",
    "Matthew 13:48": "which, when it has been filled, having drawn up on the shore and sat down, they gathered the good into vessels and cast the worthless out.",
    "Matthew 13:49": "Thus shall it be in the completion of the age: the angels shall go forth and sever the wicked from the midst of the just,",
    "Matthew 13:50": "and shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.",
    "Matthew 13:51": "Jesus says to them, Have ye understood all these things? They say to him, Yea, [Lord].",
    "Matthew 13:52": "And he said to them, For this reason every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man [that is] a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old.",
    "Matthew 13:53": "And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these parables he withdrew thence.",
    "Matthew 13:54": "And having come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, Whence has this [man] this wisdom and these works of power?",
    "Matthew 13:55": "Is not this the son of the carpenter? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brethren James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?",
    "Matthew 13:56": "And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then has this [man] all these things?",
    "Matthew 13:57": "And they were offended in him. And Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honour, unless in his country and in his house.",
    "Matthew 13:58": "And he did not there many works of power, because of their unbelief.",
    "Matthew 14:1": "At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,",
    "Matthew 14:2": "and said to his servants, This is John the baptist: he is risen from the dead, and because of this these works of power display their force in him.",
    "Matthew 14:3": "For Herod had seized John, and had bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother.",
    "Matthew 14:4": "For John said to him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.",
    "Matthew 14:5": "And [while] desiring to kill him, he feared the crowd, because they held him for a prophet.",
    "Matthew 14:6": "But when Herod’s birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod;",
    "Matthew 14:7": "whereupon he promised with oath to give her whatsoever she should ask.",
    "Matthew 14:8": "But she, being set on by her mother, says, Give me here upon a dish the head of John the baptist.",
    "Matthew 14:9": "And the king was grieved; but on account of the oaths, and those lying at table with [him], he commanded [it] to be given.",
    "Matthew 14:10": "And he sent and beheaded John in the prison;",
    "Matthew 14:11": "and his head was brought upon a dish, and was given to the damsel, and she carried [it] to her mother.",
    "Matthew 14:12": "And his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and came and brought word to Jesus.",
    "Matthew 14:13": "And Jesus, having heard it, went away thence by ship to a desert place apart. And the crowds having heard [of it] followed him on foot from the cities.",
    "Matthew 14:14": "And going out he saw a great crowd, and was moved with compassion about them, and healed their infirm.",
    "Matthew 14:15": "But when even was come, his disciples came to him saying, The place is desert, and [much of] the [day] time already gone by; dismiss the crowds, that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.",
    "Matthew 14:16": "But Jesus said to them, They have no need to go: give ye them to eat.",
    "Matthew 14:17": "But they say to him, We have not here save five loaves and two fishes.",
    "Matthew 14:18": "And he said, Bring them here to me.",
    "Matthew 14:19": "And having commanded the crowds to recline upon the grass, having taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed: and having broken the loaves, he gave [them] to the disciples, and the disciples [gave them] to the crowds.",
    "Matthew 14:20": "And all ate and were filled, and they took up what was over and above of fragments twelve hand-baskets full.",
    "Matthew 14:21": "But those that had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.",
    "Matthew 14:22": "And immediately he compelled the disciples to go on board ship, and to go on before him to the other side, until he should have dismissed the crowds.",
    "Matthew 14:23": "And having dismissed the crowds, he went up into the mountain apart to pray. And when even was come, he was alone there,",
    "Matthew 14:24": "but the ship was already in the middle of the sea tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.",
    "Matthew 14:25": "But in the fourth watch of the night he went off to them, walking on the sea.",
    "Matthew 14:26": "And the disciples, seeing him walking on the sea, were troubled, saying, It is an apparition. And they cried out through fear.",
    "Matthew 14:27": "But Jesus immediately spoke to them, saying, Take courage; it is I: be not afraid.",
    "Matthew 14:28": "And Peter answering him said, Lord, if it be thou, command me to come to thee upon the waters.",
    "Matthew 14:29": "And he said, Come. And Peter, having descended from the ship, walked upon the waters to go to Jesus.",
    "Matthew 14:30": "But seeing the wind strong he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.",
    "Matthew 14:31": "And immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and caught hold of him, and says to him, O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt?",
    "Matthew 14:32": "And when they had gone up into the ship, the wind fell.",
    "Matthew 14:33": "But those in the ship came and did homage to him, saying, Truly thou art God’s Son.",
    "Matthew 14:34": "And having crossed over they came to the land of Gennesaret.",
    "Matthew 14:35": "And when the men of that place recognised him, they sent to that whole country around, and they brought to him all that were ill,",
    "Matthew 14:36": "and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment; and as many as touched were made thoroughly well.",
    "Matthew 15:1": "Then the scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem come up to Jesus, saying,",
    "Matthew 15:2": "Why do thy disciples transgress what has been delivered by the ancients? for they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.",
    "Matthew 15:3": "But he answering said to them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God on account of your traditional teaching?",
    "Matthew 15:4": "For God commanded saying, Honour father and mother; and, He that speaks ill of father or mother, let him die the death.",
    "Matthew 15:5": "But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or mother, It is a gift, whatsoever [it be] by which [received] from me thou wouldest be profited:",
    "Matthew 15:6": "and he shall in no wise honour his father or his mother; and ye have made void the commandment of God on account of your traditional teaching.",
    "Matthew 15:7": "Hypocrites! well has Esaias prophesied about you, saying,",
    "Matthew 15:8": "This people honour me with the lips, but their heart is far away from me;",
    "Matthew 15:9": "but in vain do they worship me, teaching [as] teachings commandments of men.",
    "Matthew 15:10": "And having called to [him] the crowd, he said to them, Hear and understand:",
    "Matthew 15:11": "Not what enters into the mouth defiles the man; but what goes forth out of the mouth, this defiles the man.",
    "Matthew 15:12": "Then his disciples, coming up, said to him, Dost thou know that the Pharisees, having heard this word, have been offended?",
    "Matthew 15:13": "But he answering said, Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up.",
    "Matthew 15:14": "Leave them alone; they are blind leaders of blind: but if blind lead blind, both will fall into a ditch.",
    "Matthew 15:15": "And Peter answering said to him, Expound to us this parable.",
    "Matthew 15:16": "But he said, Are ye also still without intelligence?",
    "Matthew 15:17": "Do ye not yet apprehend, that everything that enters into the mouth finds its way into the belly, and is cast forth into the draught?",
    "Matthew 15:18": "but the things which go forth out of the mouth come out of the heart, and those defile man.",
    "Matthew 15:19": "For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnessings, blasphemies;",
    "Matthew 15:20": "these are the things which defile man; but the eating with unwashen hands does not defile man.",
    "Matthew 15:21": "And Jesus, going forth from thence, went away into the parts of Tyre and Sidon;",
    "Matthew 15:22": "and lo, a Canaanitish woman, coming out from those borders, cried [to him] saying, Have pity on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is miserably possessed by a demon.",
    "Matthew 15:23": "But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came to [him] and asked him, saying, Dismiss her, for she cries after us.",

    "Matthew 15:25": "But she came and did him homage, saying, Lord, help me.",
    "Matthew 15:26": "But he answering said, It is not well to take the bread of the children and cast it to the dogs.",
    "Matthew 15:27": "But she said, Yea, Lord; for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the table of their masters.",
    "Matthew 15:28": "Then Jesus answering said to her, O woman, thy faith [is] great. Be it to thee as thou desirest. And her daughter was healed from that hour.",
    "Matthew 15:29": "And Jesus, going away from thence, came towards the sea of Galilee, and he went up into the mountain and sat down there;",
    "Matthew 15:30": "and great crowds came to him, having with them lame, blind, dumb, crippled, and many others, and they cast them at his feet, and he healed them:",
    "Matthew 15:31": "so that the crowds wondered, seeing dumb speaking, crippled sound, lame walking, and blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.",
    "Matthew 15:32": "But Jesus, having called his disciples to [him], said, I have compassion on the crowd, because they have stayed with me already three days and they have not anything they can eat, and I would not send them away fasting lest they should faint on the way.",
    "Matthew 15:33": "And his disciples say to him, Whence should we have so many loaves in [the] wilderness as to satisfy so great a crowd?",
    "Matthew 15:34": "And Jesus says to them, How many loaves have ye? But they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.",
    "Matthew 15:35": "And he commanded the crowds to lie down on the ground;",

    "Matthew 16:10": "nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took [up]?",
    "Matthew 16:11": "How do ye not understand that [it was] not concerning bread I said to you, Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?",
    "Matthew 16:12": "Then they comprehended that he did not speak of being beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees.",
    "Matthew 16:13": "But when Jesus was come into the parts of Caesarea-Philippi, he demanded of his disciples, saying, Who do men say that I the Son of man am?",

    "Matthew 16:15": "He says to them, But ye, who do ye say that I am?",
    "Matthew 16:16": "And Simon Peter answering said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.",
    "Matthew 16:17": "And Jesus answering said to him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for flesh and blood has not revealed [it] to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens.",

    "Matthew 16:25": "For whosoever shall desire to save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it.",
    "Matthew 16:26": "For what does a man profit, if he should gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?",
    "Matthew 16:27": "For the Son of man is about to come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will render to each according to his doings.",

    "Matthew 17:11": "And he answering said to them, Elias indeed comes first and will restore all things.",
    "Matthew 17:12": "But I say unto you that Elias has already come, and they have not known him, but have done unto him whatever they would. Thus also the Son of man is about to suffer from them.",
    "Matthew 17:13": "Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the baptist.",
    "Matthew 17:14": "And when they came to the crowd, a man came to him, falling on his knees before him, and saying,",

    "Matthew 17:19": "Then the disciples, coming to Jesus apart, said [to him], Why were not we able to cast him out?",
    "Matthew 17:20": "And he says to them, Because of your unbelief; for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard [seed], ye shall say to this mountain, Be transported hence there, and it shall transport itself; and nothing shall be impossible to you.",
    "Matthew 17:21": "But this kind does not go out but by prayer and fasting.",
    "Matthew 17:22": "And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man is about to be delivered up into [the] hands of men,",

    "Matthew 17:26": "Peter says to him, From strangers. Jesus said to him, Then are the sons free.",
    "Matthew 17:27": "But that we may not be an offence to them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up, and when thou hast opened its mouth thou wilt find a stater; take that and give it to them for me and thee.",
    "Matthew 18:1": "In that hour the disciples came to Jesus saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?",
    "Matthew 18:2": "And Jesus having called a little child to [him], set it in their midst,",
    "Matthew 18:3": "and said, Verily I say to you, Unless ye are converted and become as little children, ye will not at all enter into the kingdom of the heavens.",
    "Matthew 18:4": "Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens;",
    "Matthew 18:5": "and whosoever shall receive one such little child in my name, receives me.",
    "Matthew 18:6": "But whosoever shall offend one of these little ones who believe in me, it were profitable for him that a great millstone had been hanged upon his neck and he be sunk in the depths of the sea.",
    "Matthew 18:7": "Woe to the world because of offences! For it must needs be that offences come; yet woe to that man by whom the offence comes!",
    "Matthew 18:8": "And if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut it off and cast [it] from thee; it is good for thee to enter into life lame or maimed, [rather] than having two hands or two feet to be cast into eternal fire.",

    "Matthew 18:12": "What think ye? If a certain man should have a hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, does he not, leaving the ninety and nine on the mountains, go and seek the one that has gone astray?",
    "Matthew 18:13": "And if it should come to pass that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoices more because of it than because of the ninety and nine not gone astray.",
    "Matthew 18:14": "So it is not the will of your Father who is in [the] heavens that one of these little ones should perish.",
    "Matthew 18:15": "But if thy brother sin against thee, go, reprove him between thee and him alone. If he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.",

    "Matthew 18:30": "But he would not, but went away and cast him into prison, until he should pay what was owing.",
    "Matthew 18:31": "But his fellow-bondmen, having seen what had taken place, were greatly grieved, and went and recounted to their lord all that had taken place.",
    "Matthew 18:32": "Then his lord, having called him to [him], says to him, Wicked bondman! I forgave thee all that debt because thou besoughtest me;",
    "Matthew 18:33": "shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow-bondman, as I also had compassion on thee?",
    "Matthew 18:34": "And his lord being angry delivered him to the tormentors till he paid all that was owing to him.",
    "Matthew 18:35": "Thus also my heavenly Father shall do to you if ye forgive not from your hearts every one his brother.",
    "Matthew 19:1": "And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these words, he withdrew from Galilee, and came to the coasts of Judaea beyond the Jordan;",
    "Matthew 19:2": "and great crowds followed him, and he healed them there.",
    "Matthew 19:3": "And the Pharisees came to him tempting him, and saying, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?",
    "Matthew 19:4": "But he answering said [to them], Have ye not read that he who made [them], from the beginning made them male and female,",
    "Matthew 19:5": "and said, On account of this a man shall leave father and mother, and shall be united to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh?",
    "Matthew 19:6": "so that they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.",
    "Matthew 19:7": "They say to him, Why then did Moses command to give a letter of divorce and to send [her] away?",
    "Matthew 19:8": "He says to them, Moses, in view of your hardheartedness, allowed you to put away your wives; but from the beginning it was not thus.",
    "Matthew 19:9": "But I say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, not for fornication, and shall marry another, commits adultery; and he who marries one put away commits adultery.",

    "Matthew 19:15": "and having laid his hands upon them, he departed thence.",
    "Matthew 19:16": "And lo, one coming up said to him, Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have life eternal?",
    "Matthew 19:17": "And he said to him, What askest thou me concerning goodness? one is good. But if thou wouldest enter into life, keep the commandments.",
    "Matthew 19:18": "He says to him, Which? And Jesus said, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,",

    "Matthew 19:28": "And Jesus said to them, Verily I say unto you, That ye who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit down upon his throne of glory, ye also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.",
    "Matthew 19:29": "And every one who has left houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit life eternal.",
    "Matthew 19:30": "But many first shall be last, and last first.",
    "Matthew 20:1": "For the kingdom of the heavens is like a householder who went out with the early morn to hire workmen for his vineyard.",
    "Matthew 20:2": "And having agreed with the workmen for a denarius the day, he sent them into his vineyard.",
    "Matthew 20:3": "And having gone out about [the] third hour, he saw others standing in the market-place idle;",

    "Matthew 20:8": "But when the evening was come, the lord of the vineyard says to his steward, Call the workmen and pay [them] their wages, beginning from the last even to the first.",
    "Matthew 20:9": "And when they [who came to work] about the eleventh hour came, they received each a denarius.",
    "Matthew 20:10": "And when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more, and they received also themselves each a denarius.",
    "Matthew 20:11": "And on receiving it they murmured against the master of the house,",
    "Matthew 20:12": "saying, These last have worked one hour, and thou hast made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the heat.",
    "Matthew 20:13": "But he answering said to one of them, [My] friend, I do not wrong thee. Didst thou not agree with me for a denarius?",
    "Matthew 20:14": "Take what is thine and go. But it is my will to give to this last even as to thee:",
    "Matthew 20:15": "is it not lawful for me to do what I will in my own affairs? Is thine eye evil because I am good?",
    "Matthew 20:16": "Thus shall the last be first, and the first last; for many are called ones, but few chosen ones.",
    "Matthew 20:17": "And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples with [him] apart in the way, and said to them,",
    "Matthew 20:18": "Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be delivered up to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death;",

    "Matthew 20:22": "And Jesus answering said, Ye know not what ye ask. Can ye drink the cup which I am about to drink? They say to him, We are able.",
    "Matthew 20:23": "[And] he says to them, Ye shall drink indeed my cup, but to sit on my right hand and on [my] left, is not mine to give, but to those for whom it is prepared of my Father.",
    "Matthew 20:24": "And the ten, having heard [of it], were indignant about the two brothers.",
    "Matthew 20:25": "But Jesus having called them to [him], said, Ye know that the rulers of the nations exercise lordship over them, and the great exercise authority over them.",
    "Matthew 20:26": "It shall not be thus amongst you, but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your servant;",
    "Matthew 20:27": "and whosoever will be first among you, let him be your bondman;",
    "Matthew 20:28": "as indeed the Son of man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.",
    "Matthew 20:29": "And as they went out from Jericho a great crowd followed him.",

    "Matthew 21:3": "And if any one say anything to you, ye shall say, The Lord has need of them, and straightway he will send them.",
    "Matthew 21:4": "But all this came to pass, that that might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,",
    "Matthew 21:5": "Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold thy King cometh to thee, meek, and mounted upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.",
    "Matthew 21:6": "But the disciples, having gone and done as Jesus had ordered them,",

    "Matthew 21:18": "But early in the morning, as he came back into the city, he hungered.",
    "Matthew 21:19": "And seeing one fig-tree in the way, he came to it and found on it nothing but leaves only. And he says to it, Let there be never more fruit of thee for ever. And the fig-tree was immediately dried up.",
    "Matthew 21:20": "And when the disciples saw [it], they wondered, saying, How immediately is the fig-tree dried up!",
    "Matthew 21:21": "And Jesus answering said to them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and do not doubt, not only shall ye do what [is done] to the fig-tree, but even if ye should say to this mountain, Be thou taken away and be thou cast into the sea, it shall come to pass.",

    "Mark 1:38": "And he says to them, Let us go elsewhere into the neighbouring country towns, that I may preach there also, for for this purpose am I come forth.",
    "Mark 1:39": "And he was preaching in their synagogues in the whole of Galilee, and casting out demons.",
    "Mark 1:40": "And there comes to him a leper, beseeching him, and falling on his knees to him, and saying to him, If thou wilt thou canst cleanse me.",
    "Mark 1:41": "But Jesus, moved with compassion, having stretched out his hand, touched him, and says to him, I will, be thou cleansed.",
    "Mark 1:42": "And as he spoke straightway the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed.",
    "Mark 1:43": "And having sharply charged him, he straightway sent him away,",
    "Mark 1:44": "and says to him, See thou say nothing to any one, but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing what Moses ordained, for a testimony to them.",
    "Mark 1:45": "But he, having gone forth, began to proclaim [it] much, and to spread the matter abroad, so that he could no longer enter openly into the city, but was without in desert places, and they came to him from every side.",

    "Mark 2:2": "and straightway many were gathered together, so that there was no longer any room, not even at the door; and he spoke the word to them.",
    "Mark 2:3": "And there come to him [men] bringing a paralytic, borne by four;",
    "Mark 2:4": "and, not being able to get near to him on account of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was, and having dug [it] up they let down the couch on which the paralytic lay.",
    "Mark 2:5": "But Jesus, seeing their faith, says to the paralytic, Child, thy sins are forgiven [thee].",
    "Mark 2:6": "But certain of the scribes were there sitting, and reasoning in their hearts,",
    "Mark 2:7": "Why does this [man] thus speak? he blasphemes. Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?",
    "Mark 2:8": "And straightway Jesus, knowing in his spirit that they are reasoning thus within themselves, said to them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?",
    "Mark 2:9": "Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, [Thy] sins are forgiven [thee]; or to say, Arise, and take up thy couch and walk?",
    "Mark 2:10": "But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, he says to the paralytic,",
    "Mark 2:11": "To thee I say, Arise, take up thy couch and go to thine house.",
    "Mark 2:12": "And he rose up straightway, and, having taken up his couch, went out before [them] all, so that all were amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it thus.",
    "Mark 2:13": "And he went out again by the sea, and all the crowd came to him, and he taught them.",
    "Mark 2:14": "And passing by, he saw Levi the [son] of Alphaeus sitting at the tax-office, and says to him, Follow me. And he rose up and followed him.",
    "Mark 2:15": "And it came to pass as he lay at table in his house, that many tax-gatherers and sinners lay at table with Jesus and his disciples; for they were many, and they followed him.",
    "Mark 2:16": "And the scribes and the Pharisees, seeing him eating with sinners and tax-gatherers, said to his disciples, Why [is it] that he eats and drinks with tax-gatherers and sinners?",
    "Mark 2:17": "And Jesus having heard [it] says to them, They that are strong have not need of a physician, but those who are ill. I have not come to call righteous [men], but sinners.",
    "Mark 2:18": "And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting; and they come and say to him, Why do the disciples of John and [the disciples] of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?",
    "Mark 2:19": "And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bride-chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast.",
    "Mark 2:20": "But days will come when the bridegroom shall have been taken away from them, and then shall they fast in that day.",
    "Mark 2:21": "No one sews a patch of new cloth on an old garment: otherwise its new filling-up takes from the old [stuff], and there is a worse rent.",
    "Mark 2:22": "And no one puts new wine into old skins; otherwise the wine bursts the skins, and the wine is poured out, and the skins will be destroyed; but new wine is to be put into new skins.",
    "Mark 2:23": "And it came to pass that he went on the sabbath through the cornfields; and his disciples began to walk on, plucking the ears.",
    "Mark 2:24": "And the Pharisees said to him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath what is not lawful?",
    "Mark 2:25": "And he said to them, Have ye never read what David did when he had need and hungered, he and those with him,",
    "Mark 2:26": "how he entered into the house of God, in [the section of] Abiathar [the] high priest, and ate the shew-bread, which it is not lawful unless for the priests to eat, and gave even to those that were with him?",
    "Mark 2:27": "And he said to them, The sabbath was made on account of man, not man on account of the sabbath;",
    "Mark 2:28": "so that the Son of man is lord of the sabbath also.",
    "Mark 3:1": "And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was there a man having his hand dried up.",
    "Mark 3:2": "And they watched him if he would heal him on the sabbath, that they might accuse him.",
    "Mark 3:3": "And he says to the man who had his hand dried up, Rise up [and come] into the midst.",
    "Mark 3:4": "And he says to them, Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill? But they were silent.",
    "Mark 3:5": "And looking round upon them with anger, distressed at the hardening of their heart, he says to the man, Stretch out thy hand. And he stretched [it] out, and his hand was restored.",
    "Mark 3:6": "And the Pharisees going out straightway with the Herodians took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.",
    "Mark 3:7": "And Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea; and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,",
    "Mark 3:8": "and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea and beyond the Jordan; and they of around Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, having heard what things he did, came to him.",
    "Mark 3:9": "And he spoke to his disciples, in order that a little ship should wait upon him on account of the crowd, that they might not press upon him.",
    "Mark 3:10": "For he healed many, so that they beset him that they might touch him, as many as had plagues.",
    "Mark 3:11": "And the unclean spirits, when they beheld him, fell down before him, and cried saying, Thou art the Son of God.",
    "Mark 3:12": "And he rebuked them much, that they might not make him manifest.",
    "Mark 3:13": "And he goes up into the mountain, and calls whom he himself would, and they went to him.",
    "Mark 3:14": "And he appointed twelve that they might be with him, and that he might send them to preach,",
    "Mark 3:15": "and to have power [to heal diseases, and] to cast out demons.",
    "Mark 3:16": "And he gave to Simon the surname of Peter;",
    "Mark 3:17": "and James the [son] of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, and he gave them the surname of Boanerges, that is, Sons of thunder;",
    "Mark 3:18": "and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the [son] of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean,",

    "Mark 3:23": "And having called them to [him], he said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?",
    "Mark 3:24": "And if a kingdom has become divided against itself, that kingdom cannot subsist.",
    "Mark 3:25": "And if a house has become divided against itself, that house cannot subsist.",
    "Mark 3:26": "And if Satan rise up against himself, and is divided, he cannot subsist, but has an end.",
    "Mark 3:27": "But no one can, having entered into his house, plunder the goods of the strong [man] unless he first bind the strong [man], and then he will plunder his house.",
    "Mark 3:28": "Verily I say unto you, that all sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and all the injurious speeches [with] which they may speak injuriously;",
    "Mark 3:29": "but whosoever shall speak injuriously against the Holy Spirit, to eternity has no forgiveness; but lies under the guilt of an everlasting sin;",
    "Mark 3:30": "because they said, he has an unclean spirit.",
    "Mark 3:31": "And his brethren and his mother come, and standing without sent to him calling him.",
    "Mark 3:32": "And a crowd sat around him. And they said to him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren seek thee without.",
    "Mark 3:33": "And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother or my brethren?",
    "Mark 3:34": "And looking around in a circuit at those that were sitting around him, he says, Behold my mother and my brethren:",
    "Mark 3:35": "for whosoever shall do the will of God, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.",
    "Mark 4:1": "And again he began to teach by the sea. And a great crowd was gathered together to him, so that going on board ship he sat in the sea, and all the crowd were close to the sea on the land.",
    "Mark 4:2": "And he taught them many things in parables. And he said to them in his doctrine,",
    "Mark 4:3": "Hearken: Behold, the sower went forth to sow.",
    "Mark 4:4": "And it came to pass as he sowed, one fell by the wayside, and the birds came and devoured it.",
    "Mark 4:5": "And another fell on the rocky ground, where it had not much earth, and immediately it sprung up out [of the ground] because it had no depth of earth;",
    "Mark 4:6": "and when the sun arose it was burnt up, and because of its not having any root, it withered.",
    "Mark 4:7": "And another fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.",
    "Mark 4:8": "And another fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing; and bore, one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.",
    "Mark 4:9": "And he said, He that has ears to hear, let him hear.",
    "Mark 4:10": "And when he was alone, those about him with the twelve asked him [as to] the parables.",
    "Mark 4:11": "And he said to them, To you is given [to know] the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to them who are without, all things are done in parables,",
    "Mark 4:12": "that beholding they may behold and not see, and hearing they may hear and not understand, lest it may be, they should be converted and they should be forgiven.",
    "Mark 4:13": "And he says to them, Do ye not know this parable? and how will ye be acquainted with all the parables?",
    "Mark 4:14": "The sower sows the word:",
    "Mark 4:15": "and these are they by the wayside where the word is sown, and when they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.",
    "Mark 4:16": "And these are they in like manner who are sown upon the rocky places, who when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy,",
    "Mark 4:17": "and they have no root in themselves, but are for a time: then, tribulation arising, or persecution on account of the word, immediately they are offended.",
    "Mark 4:18": "And others are they who are sown among the thorns: these are they who have heard the word,",
    "Mark 4:19": "and the cares of life, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things, entering in, choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.",
    "Mark 4:20": "And these are they who have been sown on the good ground, such as hear the word and receive it, and bear fruit; one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred [fold].",
    "Mark 4:21": "And he said to them, Does the lamp come that it should be put under the bushel or under the couch? [Is it] not that it should be set upon the lamp-stand?",
    "Mark 4:22": "For there is nothing hidden which shall not be made manifest; nor does any secret thing take place, but that it should come to light.",
    "Mark 4:23": "If any one have ears to hear, let him hear.",
    "Mark 4:24": "And he said to them, Take heed what ye hear; with what measure ye mete, it shall be meted to you; and there shall be [more] added to you.",
    "Mark 4:25": "For whosoever has, to him shall be given; and he who has not, even what he has shall be taken from him.",
    "Mark 4:26": "And he said, Thus is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast the seed upon the earth,",
    "Mark 4:27": "and should sleep and rise up night and day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he does not know how.",
    "Mark 4:28": "The earth bears fruit of itself, first [the] blade, then an ear, then full corn in the ear.",
    "Mark 4:29": "But when the fruit is produced, immediately he sends the sickle, for the harvest is come.",
    "Mark 4:30": "And he said, How should we liken the kingdom of God, or with what comparison should we compare it?",
    "Mark 4:31": "As to a grain of mustard [seed], which, when it is sown upon the earth, is less than all seeds which are upon the earth,",
    "Mark 4:32": "and when it has been sown, mounts up and becomes greater than all herbs, and produces great branches, so that the birds of heaven can roost under its shadow.",
    "Mark 4:33": "And with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear,",
    "Mark 4:34": "but without a parable spoke he not to them; and in private he explained all things to his disciples.",
    "Mark 4:35": "And on that day, when evening was come, he says to them, Let us go over to the other side:",
    "Mark 4:36": "and having sent away the crowd, they take him with [them], as he was, in the ship. But other ships also were with him.",
    "Mark 4:37": "And there comes a violent gust of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it already filled.",
    "Mark 4:38": "And he was in the stern sleeping on the cushion. And they awake him up and say to him, Teacher, dost thou not care that we are perishing?",
    "Mark 4:39": "And awaking up he rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Silence; be mute. And the wind fell, and there was a great calm.",
    "Mark 4:40": "And he said to them, Why are ye [thus] fearful? how [is it] ye have not faith?",
    "Mark 4:41": "And they feared [with] great fear, and said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?",
    "Mark 5:1": "And they came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gadarenes.",
    "Mark 5:2": "And immediately on his going out of the ship there met him out of the tombs a man possessed by an unclean spirit,",
    "Mark 5:3": "who had his dwelling in the tombs; and no one was able to bind him, not even with chains;",
    "Mark 5:4": "because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn asunder by him, and the fetters were shattered; and no one was able to subdue him.",
    "Mark 5:5": "And continually night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying and cutting himself with stones.",
    "Mark 5:6": "But seeing Jesus from afar off, he ran and did him homage,",
    "Mark 5:7": "and crying with a loud voice he says, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure thee by God, torment me not.",
    "Mark 5:8": "For he said to him, Come forth, unclean spirit, out of the man.",
    "Mark 5:9": "And he asked him, What is thy name? And he says to him, Legion is my name, because we are many.",
    "Mark 5:10": "And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.",
    "Mark 5:11": "Now there was there just at the mountain a great herd of swine feeding;",
    "Mark 5:12": "and they besought him, saying, Send us into the swine that we may enter into them.",
    "Mark 5:13": "And Jesus [immediately] allowed them. And the unclean spirits going out entered into the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep slope, into the sea (about two thousand), and were choked in the sea.",
    "Mark 5:14": "And those that were feeding them fled and reported it in the city and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that had taken place.",
    "Mark 5:15": "And they come to Jesus, and they see the possessed of demons sitting [and] clothed and sensible, [him] that had had the legion: and they were afraid.",
    "Mark 5:16": "And they that had seen [it] related to them how it had happened to the [man] possessed by demons, and concerning the swine.",
    "Mark 5:17": "And they began to beg him to depart from their coasts.",
    "Mark 5:18": "And as he went on board ship, the man that had been possessed by demons besought him that he might be with him.",
    "Mark 5:19": "And he suffered him not, but says to him, Go to thine home to thine own people, and tell them how great things the Lord has done for thee, and has had mercy on thee.",
    "Mark 5:20": "And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him; and all wondered.",
    "Mark 5:21": "And Jesus having passed over in the ship again to the other side, a great crowd gathered to him; and he was by the sea.",
    "Mark 5:22": "And [behold] there comes one of the rulers of the synagogue, by name Jairus, and seeing him, falls down at his feet;",
    "Mark 5:23": "and he besought him much, saying, My little daughter is at extremity; [I pray] that thou shouldest come and lay thy hands upon her so that she may be healed, and may live.",
    "Mark 5:24": "And he went with him, and a large crowd followed him and pressed on him.",
    "Mark 5:25": "And a certain woman who had had a flux of blood twelve years,",
    "Mark 5:26": "and had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent everything she had and had found no advantage from it, but had rather got worse,",
    "Mark 5:27": "having heard concerning Jesus, came in the crowd behind and touched his clothes;",
    "Mark 5:28": "for she said, If I shall touch but his clothes I shall be healed.",
    "Mark 5:29": "And immediately her fountain of blood was dried up, and she knew in her body that she was cured from the scourge.",
    "Mark 5:30": "And immediately Jesus, knowing in himself the power that had gone out of him, turning round in the crowd said, Who has touched my clothes?",
    "Mark 5:31": "And his disciples said to him, Thou seest the crowd pressing on thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?",
    "Mark 5:32": "And he looked round about to see her who had done this.",
    "Mark 5:33": "But the woman, frightened and trembling, knowing what had taken place in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.",
    "Mark 5:34": "And he said to her, Daughter, thy faith has healed thee; go in peace, and be well of thy scourge.",
    "Mark 5:35": "While he was yet speaking, they come from the ruler of the synagogue’s [house], saying, Thy daughter has died, why troublest thou the teacher any further?",
    "Mark 5:36": "But Jesus [immediately], having heard the word spoken, says to the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not; only believe.",
    "Mark 5:37": "And he suffered no one to accompany him save Peter and James, and John the brother of James.",
    "Mark 5:38": "And he comes to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and sees the tumult, and people weeping and wailing greatly.",
    "Mark 5:39": "And entering in he says to them, Why do ye make a tumult and weep? the child has not died, but sleeps.",
    "Mark 5:40": "And they derided him. But he, having put [them] all out, takes with [him] the father of the child, and the mother, and those that were with him, and enters in where the child was lying.",
    "Mark 5:41": "And having laid hold of the hand of the child, he says to her, Talitha koumi, which is, interpreted, Damsel, I say to thee, Arise.",
    "Mark 5:42": "And immediately the damsel arose and walked, for she was twelve years old. And they were astonished with great astonishment.",
    "Mark 5:43": "And he charged them much that no one should know this; and he desired that [something] should be given her to eat.",
    "Mark 6:1": "And he went out thence and came to his own country, and his disciples follow him.",
    "Mark 6:2": "And when sabbath was come he began to teach in the synagogue, and many hearing were amazed, saying, Whence [has] this [man] these things? and what [is] the wisdom that is given to him, and such works of power are done by his hands?",
    "Mark 6:3": "Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended in him.",
    "Mark 6:4": "But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not despised save in his own country, and among [his] kinsmen, and in his own house.",
    "Mark 6:5": "And he could not do any work of power there, save that laying his hands on a few infirm persons he healed [them].",
    "Mark 6:6": "And he wondered because of their unbelief. And he went round the villages in a circuit, teaching.",
    "Mark 6:7": "And he calls the twelve to [him]; and he began to send them out two [and] two, and gave to them power over the unclean spirits;",
    "Mark 6:8": "and he commanded them that they should take nothing for the way, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their belt;",
    "Mark 6:9": "but be shod with sandals, and put not on two body-coats.",
    "Mark 6:10": "And he said to them, Wheresoever ye shall enter into a house, there remain till ye shall go thence.",
    "Mark 6:11": "And whatsoever place shall not receive you nor hear you, departing thence, shake off the dust which is under your feet for a testimony to them.",
    "Mark 6:12": "And they went forth and preached that they should repent;",
    "Mark 6:13": "and they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many infirm, and healed them.",
    "Mark 6:14": "And Herod the king heard [of him] (for his name had become public), and said, John the baptist is risen from among [the] dead, and on this account works of power are wrought by him.",
    "Mark 6:15": "And others said, It is Elias; and others said, It is a prophet, as one of the prophets.",
    "Mark 6:16": "But Herod when he heard [it] said, John whom I beheaded, he it is; he is risen [from among the dead].",
    "Mark 6:17": "For the same Herod had sent and seized John, and had bound him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother, because he had married her.",
    "Mark 6:18": "For John said to Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have the wife of thy brother.",
    "Mark 6:19": "But Herodias kept it [in her mind] against him, and wished to kill him, and could not:",
    "Mark 6:20": "for Herod feared John knowing that he was a just and holy man, and kept him safe; and having heard him, did many things, and heard him gladly.",
    "Mark 6:21": "And a holiday being come, when Herod, on his birthday, made a supper to his grandees, and to the chiliarchs, and the chief [men] of Galilee;",
    "Mark 6:22": "and the daughter of the same Herodias having come in, and danced, pleased Herod and those that were with [him] at table; and the king said to the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt and I will give it thee.",
    "Mark 6:23": "And he swore to her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask me I will give thee, to half of my kingdom.",
    "Mark 6:24": "And she went out, and said to her mother, What should I ask? And she said, The head of John the baptist.",
    "Mark 6:25": "And immediately going in with haste to the king, she asked saying, I desire that thou give me directly upon a dish the head of John the baptist.",
    "Mark 6:26": "And the king, [while] made very sorry, on account of the oaths and those lying at table with [him] would not break his word with her.",
    "Mark 6:27": "And immediately the king, having sent one of the guard, ordered his head to be brought. And he went out and beheaded him in the prison,",
    "Mark 6:28": "and brought his head upon a dish, and gave it to the damsel, and the damsel gave it to her mother.",
    "Mark 6:29": "And his disciples having heard [it], came and took up his body, and laid it in a tomb.",
    "Mark 6:30": "And the apostles are gathered together to Jesus. And they related to him all things, [both] what they had done and what they had taught.",
    "Mark 6:31": "And he said to them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a little. For those coming and those going were many, and they had not leisure even to eat.",
    "Mark 6:32": "And they went away apart into a desert place by ship.",
    "Mark 6:33": "And many saw them going, and recognised them, and ran together there on foot, out of all the cities, and got [there] before them.",
    "Mark 6:34": "And on leaving [the ship] [Jesus] saw a great crowd, and he was moved with compassion for them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd. And he began to teach them many things.",

    "Mark 6:37": "And he answering said to them, Give ye them to eat. And they say to him, Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give them to eat?",
    "Mark 6:38": "And he says to them, How many loaves have ye? Go [and] see. And when they knew they say, Five, and two fishes.",
    "Mark 6:39": "And he ordered them to make them all sit down by companies on the green grass.",
    "Mark 6:40": "And they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties.",
    "Mark 6:41": "And having taken the five loaves and the two fishes, looking up to heaven, he blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave [them] to his disciples that they might set [them] before them. And the two fishes he divided among all.",
    "Mark 6:42": "And they all ate and were satisfied.",
    "Mark 6:43": "And they took up of fragments the fillings of twelve hand-baskets, and of the fishes.",
    "Mark 6:44": "And those that ate of the loaves were five thousand men.",
    "Mark 6:45": "And immediately he compelled his disciples to go on board ship, and to go on before to the other side to Bethsaida, while he sends the crowd away.",
    "Mark 6:46": "And, having dismissed them, he departed into the mountain to pray.",
    "Mark 6:47": "And when evening was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone upon the land.",
    "Mark 6:48": "And seeing them labouring in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the night he comes to them walking on the sea, and would have passed them by.",
    "Mark 6:49": "But they, seeing him walking on the sea, thought that it was an apparition, and cried out.",
    "Mark 6:50": "For all saw him and were troubled. And immediately he spoke with them, and says to them, Be of good courage: it is I; be not afraid.",
    "Mark 6:51": "And he went up to them into the ship, and the wind fell. And they were exceedingly beyond measure astonished in themselves and wondered;",
    "Mark 6:52": "for they understood not through the loaves: for their heart was hardened.",
    "Mark 6:53": "And having passed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret and made the shore.",
    "Mark 6:54": "And on their coming out of the ship, immediately recognising him,",
    "Mark 6:55": "they ran through that whole country around, and began to carry about those that were ill on couches, where they heard that he was.",
    "Mark 6:56": "And wherever he entered into villages, or cities, or the country, they laid the sick in the market-places, and besought him that they might touch if it were only the hem of his garment; and as many as touched him were healed.",
    "Mark 7:1": "And the Pharisees and some of the scribes, coming from Jerusalem, are gathered together to him,",
    "Mark 7:2": "and seeing some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is, unwashed, hands,",
    "Mark 7:3": "(for the Pharisees and all the Jews, unless they wash their hands diligently, do not eat, holding what has been delivered by the ancients;",
    "Mark 7:4": "and [on coming] from the market-place, unless they are washed, they do not eat; and there are many other things which they have received to hold, the washing of cups and vessels, and brazen utensils, and couches),",
    "Mark 7:5": "then the Pharisees and the scribes ask him, Why do thy disciples not walk according to what has been delivered by the ancients, but eat the bread with defiled hands?",
    "Mark 7:6": "But he answering said to them, Well did Esaias prophesy concerning you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honour me with their lips, but their heart is far away from me.",
    "Mark 7:7": "But in vain do they worship me, teaching [as their] teachings commandments of men.",
    "Mark 7:8": "[For], leaving the commandment of God, ye hold what is delivered by men [to keep]—washings of vessels and cups, and many other such like things ye do.",
    "Mark 7:9": "And he said to them, Well do ye set aside the commandment of God, that ye may observe what is delivered by yourselves [to keep].",
    "Mark 7:10": "For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, he who speaks ill of father or mother, let him surely die.",
    "Mark 7:11": "But ye say, If a man say to his father or his mother, [It is] corban (that is, gift), whatsoever thou mightest have profit from me by...",
    "Mark 7:12": "And ye no longer suffer him to do anything for his father or his mother;",
    "Mark 7:13": "making void the word of God by your traditional teaching which ye have delivered; and many such like things ye do.",
    "Mark 7:14": "And having called again the crowd, he said to them, Hear me, all [of you], and understand:",
    "Mark 7:15": "There is nothing from outside a man entering into him which can defile him; but the things which go out from him, those it is which defile the man.",
    "Mark 7:16": "If any one have ears to hear, let him hear.",
    "Mark 7:17": "And when he went indoors from the crowd, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.",
    "Mark 7:18": "And he says to them, Are ye also thus unintelligent? Do ye not perceive that all that is outside entering into the man cannot defile him,",
    "Mark 7:19": "because it does not enter into his heart but into his belly, and goes out into the draught, purging all meats?",
    "Mark 7:20": "And he said, That which goes forth out of the man, that defiles the man.",
    "Mark 7:21": "For from within, out of the heart of men, go forth evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,",
    "Mark 7:22": "thefts, covetousness, wickednesses, deceit, licentiousness, a wicked eye, injurious language, haughtiness, folly;",
    "Mark 7:23": "all these wicked things go forth from within and defile the man.",
    "Mark 7:24": "And he rose up and went away thence into the borders of Tyre and Sidon; and having entered into a house he would not have any one know [it], and he could not be hid.",
    "Mark 7:25": "But immediately a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell at his feet",
    "Mark 7:26": "(and the woman was a Greek, Syrophenician by race), and asked him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.",
    "Mark 7:27": "But [Jesus] said to her, Suffer the children to be first filled; for it is not right to take the children’s bread and cast it to the dogs.",
    "Mark 7:28": "But she answered and says to him, Yea, Lord; for even the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.",
    "Mark 7:29": "And he said to her, Because of this word, go thy way, the demon is gone out of thy daughter.",
    "Mark 7:30": "And having gone away to her house she found the demon gone out, and her daughter lying on the bed.",
    "Mark 7:31": "And again having left the borders of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.",
    "Mark 7:32": "And they bring to him a deaf [man] who could not speak right, and they beseech him that he might lay his hand on him.",
    "Mark 7:33": "And having taken him away from the crowd apart, he put his fingers to his ears; and having spit, he touched his tongue;",
    "Mark 7:34": "and looking up to heaven he groaned, and says to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.",
    "Mark 7:35": "And immediately his ears were opened, and the band of his tongue was loosed and he spoke right.",
    "Mark 7:36": "And he charged them that they should speak to no one [of it]. But so much the more he charged them, so much the more abundantly they proclaimed it;",
    "Mark 7:37": "and they were astonished above measure, saying, He does all things well; he makes both the deaf to hear, and the speechless to speak.",
    "Mark 8:1": "In those days, there being again a great crowd, and they having nothing that they could eat, having called his disciples to [him], he says to them,",
    "Mark 8:2": "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have stayed with me already three days and they have not anything they can eat,",
    "Mark 8:3": "and if I should dismiss them to their home fasting, they will faint on the way; for some of them are come from far.",
    "Mark 8:4": "And his disciples answered him, Whence shall one be able to satisfy these with bread here in a desert place?",
    "Mark 8:5": "And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.",
    "Mark 8:6": "And he commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground. And having taken the seven loaves, he gave thanks, and broke [them] and gave [them] to his disciples, that they might set [them] before [them]; and they set [them] before the crowd.",
    "Mark 8:7": "And they had a few small fishes, and having blessed them, he desired these also to be set before [them].",
    "Mark 8:8": "And they ate and were satisfied. And they took up of fragments that remained seven baskets.",
    "Mark 8:9": "And they [that had eaten] were about four thousand; and he sent them away.",
    "Mark 8:10": "And immediately going on board ship with his disciples, he came into the parts of Dalmanutha.",
    "Mark 8:11": "And the Pharisees went out and began to dispute against him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, tempting him.",
    "Mark 8:12": "And groaning in his spirit, he says, Why does this generation seek a sign? Verily I say unto you, A sign shall in no wise be given to this generation.",
    "Mark 8:13": "And he left them, and going again on board ship, went away to the other side.",
    "Mark 8:14": "And they forgot to take bread, and save one loaf, they had not [any] with them in the ship.",
    "Mark 8:15": "And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and [of] the leaven of Herod.",
    "Mark 8:16": "And they reasoned with one another, [saying], It is because we have no bread.",
    "Mark 8:17": "And Jesus knowing [it], says to them, Why reason ye because ye have no bread? Do ye not yet perceive nor understand? Have ye your heart [yet] hardened?",
    "Mark 8:18": "Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?",
    "Mark 8:19": "When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many hand-baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say to him, Twelve.",
    "Mark 8:20": "And when the seven for the four thousand, the filling of how many baskets of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.",
    "Mark 8:21": "And he said to them, How do ye not yet understand?",
    "Mark 8:22": "And he comes to Bethsaida; and they bring him a blind man, and beseech him that he might touch him.",
    "Mark 8:23": "And taking hold of the hand of the blind man he led him forth out of the village, and having spit upon his eyes, he laid his hands upon him, and asked him if he beheld anything.",
    "Mark 8:24": "And having looked up, he said, I behold men, for I see [them], as trees, walking.",
    "Mark 8:25": "Then he laid his hands again upon his eyes, and he saw distinctly, and was restored and saw all things clearly.",
    "Mark 8:26": "And he sent him to his house, saying, Neither enter into the village, nor tell [it] to any one in the village.",
    "Mark 8:27": "And Jesus went forth and his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea-Philippi. And by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Who do men say that I am?",
    "Mark 8:28": "And they answered him, saying, John the baptist; and others, Elias; but others, One of the prophets.",
    "Mark 8:29": "And he asked them, But ye, who do ye say that I am? And Peter answering says to him, Thou art the Christ.",
    "Mark 8:30": "And he charged them straitly, in order that they should tell no man about him.",
    "Mark 8:31": "And he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and of the chief priests and of the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise [again].",
    "Mark 8:32": "And he spoke the thing openly. And Peter, taking him to [him], began to rebuke him.",
    "Mark 8:33": "But he, turning round and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, saying, Get away behind me, Satan, for thy mind is not on the things that are of God, but on the things that are of men.",
    "Mark 8:34": "And having called the crowd with his disciples, he said to them, Whoever desires to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me.",
    "Mark 8:35": "For whosoever shall desire to save his life shall lose it, but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s shall save it.",
    "Mark 8:36": "For what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his soul?",
    "Mark 8:37": "for what should a man give in exchange for his soul?",
    "Mark 8:38": "For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him shall the Son of man also be ashamed when he shall come in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.",
    "Mark 9:1": "And he said to them, Verily I say unto you, There are some of those standing here that shall not taste death until they shall have seen the kingdom of God come in power.",
    "Mark 9:2": "And after six days Jesus takes with [him] Peter and James and John, and takes them up on a high mountain by themselves apart. And he was transfigured before them:",
    "Mark 9:3": "and his garments became shining, exceeding white [as snow], such as fuller on earth could not whiten [them].",
    "Mark 9:4": "And there appeared to them Elias with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.",
    "Mark 9:5": "And Peter answering says to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good that we should be here; and let us make three tabernacles, for thee one, and for Moses one, and for Elias one.",
    "Mark 9:6": "For he knew not what he should say, for they were filled with fear.",
    "Mark 9:7": "And there came a cloud overshadowing them, and there came a voice out of the cloud, This is my beloved Son: hear him.",
    "Mark 9:8": "And suddenly having looked around, they no longer saw any one, but Jesus alone with themselves.",
    "Mark 9:9": "And as they descended from the mountain, he charged them that they should relate to no one what they had seen, unless when the Son of man should be risen from among [the] dead.",
    "Mark 9:10": "And they kept that saying, questioning among themselves, what rising from among [the] dead was.",
    "Mark 9:11": "And they asked him saying, Why do the scribes say that Elias must first have come?",
    "Mark 9:12": "And he answering said to them, Elias indeed, having first come, restores all things; and how is it written of the Son of man that he must suffer much, and be set at nought:",
    "Mark 9:13": "but I say unto you that Elias also is come, and they have done to him whatever they would, as it is written of him.",
    "Mark 9:14": "And when he came to the disciples he saw a great crowd around them, and scribes disputing against them.",
    "Mark 9:15": "And immediately all the crowd seeing him were amazed, and running to [him], saluted him.",
    "Mark 9:16": "And he asked them, What do ye question with them about?",
    "Mark 9:17": "And one out of the crowd answered him, Teacher, I brought to thee my son, who has a dumb spirit;",
    "Mark 9:18": "and wheresoever it seizes him it tears him, and he foams and gnashes his teeth, and he is withering away. And I spoke to thy disciples, that they might cast him out, and they could not.",
    "Mark 9:19": "But he answering them says, O unbelieving generation! how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him to me.",
    "Mark 9:20": "And they brought him to him. And seeing him the spirit immediately tore him; and falling upon the earth he rolled foaming.",
    "Mark 9:21": "And he asked his father, How long a time is it that it has been like this with him? And he said, From childhood;",
    "Mark 9:22": "and often it has cast him both into fire and into waters that it might destroy him: but if thou couldst [do] anything, be moved with pity on us, and help us.",
    "Mark 9:23": "And Jesus said to him, The ‘if thou couldst’ is [if thou couldst] believe: all things are possible to him that believes.",
    "Mark 9:24": "And immediately the father of the young child crying out said [with tears], I believe, help mine unbelief.",
    "Mark 9:25": "But Jesus, seeing that [the] crowd was running up together, rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.",
    "Mark 9:26": "And having cried out and torn [him] much, he came out; and he became as if dead, so that the most said, He is dead.",
    "Mark 9:27": "But Jesus, having taken hold of him by the hand, lifted him up, and he arose.",
    "Mark 9:28": "And when he was entered into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Wherefore could not we cast him out?",
    "Mark 9:29": "And he said to them, This kind can go out by nothing but by prayer and fasting.",
    "Mark 9:30": "And going forth from thence they went through Galilee; and he would not that any one knew it;",
    "Mark 9:31": "for he taught his disciples and said to them, The Son of man is delivered into men’s hands, and they shall kill him; and having been killed, after three days he shall rise again.",
    "Mark 9:32": "But they understood not the saying, and feared to ask him.",
    "Mark 9:33": "And he came to Capernaum, and being in the house, he asked them, Of what were ye reasoning by the way?",
    "Mark 9:34": "And they remained silent, for by the way they had been reasoning with one another who [was] greatest.",
    "Mark 9:35": "And sitting down he called the twelve; and he says to them, If any one would be first, he shall be last of all, and minister of all.",
    "Mark 9:36": "And taking a little child he set it in their midst, and having taken it in his arms he said to them,",
    "Mark 9:37": "Whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name, receives me; and whosoever shall receive me, does not receive me, but him who sent me.",
    "Mark 9:38": "And John answered him saying, Teacher, we saw some one casting out demons in thy name, who does not follow us, and we forbad him, because he does not follow us.",
    "Mark 9:39": "But Jesus said, Forbid him not; for there is no one who shall do a miracle in my name, and be able soon [after] to speak ill of me;",
    "Mark 9:40": "for he who is not against us is for us.",
    "Mark 9:41": "For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in [my] name, because ye are Christ’s, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.",
    "Mark 9:42": "And whosoever shall be a snare to one of the little ones who believe [in me], it were better for him if a millstone were hung about his neck, and he cast into the sea.",
    "Mark 9:43": "And if thy hand serve as a snare to thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having thy two hands to go away into hell, into the fire unquenchable;",
    "Mark 9:44": "[where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched].",
    "Mark 9:45": "And if thy foot serve as a snare to thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life lame, than having thy two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire unquenchable;",
    "Mark 9:46": "[where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched].",
    "Mark 9:47": "And if thine eye serve as a snare to thee, cast it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire,",
    "Mark 9:48": "where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.",
    "Mark 9:49": "For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.",
    "Mark 9:50": "Salt [is] good, but if the salt is become saltless, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.",
    "Mark 10:1": "And rising up thence he comes into the coasts of Judaea, and the other side of the Jordan. And again crowds come together to him, and, as he was accustomed, again he taught them.",
    "Mark 10:2": "And Pharisees coming to [him] asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away [his] wife? (tempting him).",
    "Mark 10:3": "But he answering said to them, What did Moses command you?",
    "Mark 10:4": "And they said, Moses allowed to write a bill of divorce, and to put away.",
    "Mark 10:5": "And Jesus answering said to them, In view of your hard-heartedness he wrote this commandment for you;",
    "Mark 10:6": "but from [the] beginning of [the] creation God made them male and female.",
    "Mark 10:7": "For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be united to his wife,",
    "Mark 10:8": "and the two shall be one flesh: so that they are no longer two but one flesh.",
    "Mark 10:9": "What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.",
    "Mark 10:10": "And again in the house the disciples asked him concerning this.",

    "Mark 10:15": "Verily I say to you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, shall in no wise enter into it.",
    "Mark 10:16": "And having taken them in his arms, having laid his hands on them, he blessed them.",
    "Mark 10:17": "And as he went forth into the way, a person ran up to [him], and kneeling to him asked him, Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?",
    "Mark 10:18": "But Jesus said to him, Why callest thou me good? no one is good but one, [that is] God.",
    "Mark 10:19": "Thou knowest the commandments: Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honour thy father and mother.",
    "Mark 10:20": "And he answering said to him, Teacher, all these things have I kept from my youth.",
    "Mark 10:21": "And Jesus looking upon him loved him, and said to him, One thing lackest thou: go, sell whatever thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, [taking up the cross].",
    "Mark 10:22": "But he, sad at the word, went away grieved, for he had large possessions.",
    "Mark 10:23": "And Jesus looking around says to his disciples, How difficultly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!",
    "Mark 10:24": "And the disciples were amazed at his words. And Jesus again answering says to them, Children, how difficult it is that those who trust in riches should enter into the kingdom of God!",
    "Mark 10:25": "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.",
    "Mark 10:26": "And they were exceedingly astonished, saying to one another, And who can be saved?",
    "Mark 10:27": "But Jesus looking on them says, With men it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God.",
    "Mark 10:28": "Peter began to say to him, Behold, we have left all things and have followed thee.",
    "Mark 10:29": "Jesus answering said, Verily I say to you, There is no one who has left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, [or wife], or children, or lands, for my sake and for the sake of the gospel,",
    "Mark 10:30": "that shall not receive a hundredfold now in this time: houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions, and in the coming age life eternal.",
    "Mark 10:31": "But many first shall be last, and the last first.",
    "Mark 10:32": "And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going on before them; and they were amazed, and were afraid as they followed. And taking the twelve again to [him], he began to tell them what was going to happen to him:",
    "Mark 10:33": "Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be delivered up to the chief priests and to the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him up to the nations:",

    "Mark 10:38": "And Jesus said to them, Ye do not know what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup which I drink, or be baptised with the baptism that I am baptised with?",
    "Mark 10:39": "And they said to him, We are able. And Jesus said to them, The cup that I drink ye will drink and with the baptism that I am baptised with ye will be baptised,",
    "Mark 10:40": "but to sit on my right hand or on my left is not mine to give, but for those for whom it is prepared.",
    "Mark 10:41": "And the ten having heard [of it], began to be indignant about James and John.",
    "Mark 10:42": "But Jesus having called them to [him], says to them, Ye know that those who are esteemed to rule over the nations exercise lordship over them; and their great men exercise authority over them;",

    "Mark 10:50": "And, throwing away his garment, he started up and came to Jesus.",
    "Mark 10:51": "And Jesus answering says to him, What wilt thou that I shall do to thee? And the blind [man] said to him, Rabboni, that I may see.",

    "Mark 11:6": "And they said to them as Jesus had commanded. And they let them [do it].",
    "Mark 11:7": "And they led the colt to Jesus, and cast their clothes upon it, and he sat on it;",
    "Mark 11:8": "and many strewed their clothes on the way, and others cut down branches from the trees [and went on strewing them on the way].",
    "Mark 11:9": "And those going on before and those following cried out, Hosanna! blessed [be] he that comes in [the] Lord’s name.",
    "Mark 11:10": "Blessed [be] the coming kingdom of our father David. Hosanna in the highest!",
    "Mark 11:11": "And he entered into Jerusalem and into the temple; and having looked round on all things, the hour being already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.",
    "Mark 11:12": "And on the morrow, when they were gone out of Bethany, he hungered.",
    "Mark 11:13": "And seeing from afar off a fig-tree which had leaves, he came, if perhaps he might find something on it. And having come up to it he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the time of figs.",
    "Mark 11:14": "And answering he said to it, Let no one eat fruit of thee any more for ever. And his disciples heard [it].",
    "Mark 11:15": "And they come to Jerusalem, and entering into the temple, he began to cast out those who sold and who bought in the temple, and he overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of the dove-sellers,",
    "Mark 11:16": "and suffered not that any one should carry any package through the temple.",

    "Mark 11:20": "And passing by early in the morning they saw the fig-tree dried up from the roots.",
    "Mark 11:21": "And Peter, remembering [what Jesus had said], says to him, Rabbi, see, the fig-tree which thou cursedst is dried up.",
    "Mark 11:22": "And Jesus answering says to them, Have faith in God.",
    "Mark 11:23": "Verily I say to you, that whosoever shall say to this mountain, Be thou taken away and cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but believe that what he says takes place, whatever he shall say shall come to pass for him.",
    "Mark 11:24": "For this reason I say to you, All things whatsoever ye pray for and ask, believe that ye receive it, and it shall come to pass for you.",
    "Mark 11:25": "And when ye stand praying, forgive if ye have anything against any one, that your Father also who is in the heavens may forgive you your offences.",

    "Mark 11:27": "And they come again to Jerusalem. And as he walked about in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders come to him,",
    "Mark 11:28": "and they say to him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority, that thou shouldest do these things?",
    "Mark 11:29": "And Jesus answering said to them, I also will ask you one thing, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things:",
    "Mark 11:30": "The baptism of John, was it of heaven, or of men? answer me.",
    "Mark 11:31": "And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we should say, Of heaven, he will say, Why [then] have ye not believed him?",
    "Mark 11:32": "but should we say, Of men—they feared the people; for all held of John that he was truly a prophet.",
    "Mark 11:33": "And they answering say to Jesus, We do not know. And Jesus [answering] says to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.",
    "Mark 12:1": "And he began to say to them in parables, A man planted a vineyard, and made a fence round [it] and dug a wine-vat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and left the country.",
    "Mark 12:2": "And he sent a bondman to the husbandmen at the season, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.",
    "Mark 12:3": "But they took him, and beat [him], and sent [him] away empty.",
    "Mark 12:4": "And again he sent to them another bondman; and [at] him they [threw stones, and] struck [him] on the head, and sent [him] away with insult.",
    "Mark 12:5": "And [again] he sent another, and him they killed; and many others, beating some and killing some.",

    "Mark 12:9": "What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others.",
    "Mark 12:10": "Have ye not even read this scripture, The stone which they that builded rejected, this has become the corner-stone:",
    "Mark 12:11": "this is of [the] Lord, and it is wonderful in our eyes?",
    "Mark 12:12": "And they sought to lay hold of him, and they feared the crowd; for they knew that he had spoken the parable of them. And they left him and went away.",
    "Mark 12:13": "And they send to him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that they might catch him in speaking.",
    "Mark 12:14": "And they come and say to him, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and carest not for any one; for thou regardest not men’s person, but teachest the way of God with truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not?",
    "Mark 12:15": "Should we give, or should we not give? But he knowing their hypocrisy said unto them, Why tempt ye me? Bring me a denarius that I may see [it].",
    "Mark 12:16": "And they brought [it]. And he says to them, Whose [is] this image and superscription? And they said to him, Caesar’s.",
    "Mark 12:17": "And Jesus answering said to them, Pay what is Caesar’s to Caesar, and what is God’s to God. And they wondered at him.",
    "Mark 12:18": "And Sadducees come to him, that say there is no resurrection; and they demanded of him saying,",
    "Mark 12:19": "Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if any one’s brother die, and leave a wife behind, and leave no children, that his brother shall take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.",
    "Mark 12:20": "There were seven brethren; and the first took a wife, and dying did not leave seed;",
    "Mark 12:21": "and the second took her and died, and neither did he leave seed; and the third likewise.",
    "Mark 12:22": "And the seven [took her and] did not leave seed. Last of all the woman also died.",
    "Mark 12:23": "In the resurrection, when they shall rise again, of which of them shall she be wife, for the seven had her as wife?",
    "Mark 12:24": "And Jesus answering said to them, Do not ye therefore err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God?",
    "Mark 12:25": "For when they rise from among [the] dead they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as angels [who are] in the heavens.",
    "Mark 12:26": "But concerning the dead that they rise, have ye not read in the book of Moses, in [the section of] the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, I [am] the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?",
    "Mark 12:27": "He is not the God of [the] dead, but of [the] living. Ye therefore greatly err.",
    "Mark 12:28": "And one of the scribes who had come up, and had heard them reasoning together, perceiving that he had answered them well, demanded of him, Which is [the] first commandment of all?",
    "Mark 12:29": "And Jesus answered him, [The] first commandment of all [is], Hear, Israel: the Lord our God is one Lord;",
    "Mark 12:30": "and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thine understanding, and with all thy strength. This is [the] first commandment.",
    "Mark 12:31": "And a second like it [is] this: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is not another commandment greater than these.",
    "Mark 12:32": "And the scribe said to him, Right, teacher; thou hast spoken according to [the] truth. For he is one, and there is none other besides him;",
    "Mark 12:33": "and to love him with all the heart, and with all the intelligence, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love one’s neighbour as one’s self, is more than all the burnt-offerings and sacrifices.",
    "Mark 12:34": "And Jesus, seeing that he had answered intelligently, said to him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no one dared question him any more.",
    "Mark 12:35": "And Jesus answering said [as he was] teaching in the temple, How do the scribes say that the Christ is son of David?",
    "Mark 12:36": "[for] David himself said [speaking] in the Holy Spirit, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand until I put thine enemies [as] footstool of thy feet.",
    "Mark 12:37": "David himself [therefore] calls him Lord, and whence is he his son? And the mass of the people heard him gladly.",
    "Mark 12:38": "And he said to them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, who like to walk about in long robes, and salutations in the marketplaces,",
    "Mark 12:39": "and first seats in the synagogues, and first places at suppers;",
    "Mark 12:40": "who devour the houses of widows, and as a pretext make long prayers. These shall receive a severer judgment.",
    "Mark 12:41": "And Jesus, having sat down opposite the treasury, saw how the crowd was casting money into the treasury; and many rich cast in much.",
    "Mark 12:42": "And a poor widow came and cast in two mites, which is a farthing.",
    "Mark 12:43": "And having called his disciples to [him] he said to them, Verily I say unto you, This poor widow has cast in more than all who have cast into the treasury:",
    "Mark 12:44": "for all have cast in of that which they had in abundance, but she of her destitution has cast in all that she had, the whole of her living.",
    "Mark 13:1": "And as he was going out of the temple, one of his disciples says to him, Teacher, see what stones and what buildings!",
    "Mark 13:2": "And Jesus answering said to him, Seest thou these great buildings? not a stone shall be left upon a stone, which shall not be thrown down.",
    "Mark 13:3": "And as he sat on the mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,",
    "Mark 13:4": "Tell us, when shall these things be, and what is the sign when all these things are going to be fulfilled?",
    "Mark 13:5": "And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any one mislead you.",
    "Mark 13:6": "For many shall come in my name, saying, It is I, and shall mislead many.",
    "Mark 13:7": "But when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be not disturbed, for [this] must happen, but the end is not yet.",
    "Mark 13:8": "For nation shall rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be earthquakes in [different] places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these things [are the] beginnings of throes.",
    "Mark 13:9": "But ye, take heed to yourselves, for they shall deliver you up to sanhedrims and to synagogues: ye shall be beaten and brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them;",
    "Mark 13:10": "and the gospel must first be preached to all the nations.",
    "Mark 13:11": "But when they shall lead you away to deliver you up, be not careful beforehand as to what ye shall say, [nor prepare your discourse]: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak; for ye are not the speakers, but the Holy Spirit.",
    "Mark 13:12": "But brother shall deliver up brother to death, and father child; and children shall rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.",
    "Mark 13:13": "And ye will be hated of all on account of my name; but he that has endured to the end, he shall be saved.",
    "Mark 13:14": "But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not, (he that reads let him consider [it],) then let those in Judaea flee to the mountains;",
    "Mark 13:15": "and him that is upon the housetop not come down into the house, nor enter [into it] to take away anything out of his house;",
    "Mark 13:16": "and him that is in the field not return back to take his garment.",
    "Mark 13:17": "But woe to those that are with child and to those that give suck in those days!",
    "Mark 13:18": "And pray that it may not be in winter time;",
    "Mark 13:19": "for those days shall be distress such as there has not been the like since [the] beginning of creation which God created, until now, and never shall be;",
    "Mark 13:20": "and if [the] Lord had not cut short those days, no flesh should have been saved; but on account of the elect whom he has chosen, he has cut short those days.",
    "Mark 13:21": "And then if any one say to you, Lo, here [is] the Christ, or Lo, there, believe [it] not.",
    "Mark 13:22": "For false Christs and false prophets will arise, and give signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.",
    "Mark 13:23": "But do ye take heed: behold, I have told you all things beforehand.",
    "Mark 13:24": "But in those days, after that distress, the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give its light;",
    "Mark 13:25": "and the stars of heaven shall be falling down, and the powers which are in the heavens shall be shaken;",
    "Mark 13:26": "and then shall they see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory;",
    "Mark 13:27": "and then shall he send his angels and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from end of earth to end of heaven.",
    "Mark 13:28": "But learn the parable from the fig-tree: when its branch already becomes tender and puts forth the leaves, ye know that the summer is near.",
    "Mark 13:29": "Thus also ye, when ye see these things happening, know that it is near, at the doors.",
    "Mark 13:30": "Verily I say unto you, This generation shall in no wise pass away, till all these things take place.",
    "Mark 13:31": "The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but my words shall in no wise pass away.",
    "Mark 13:32": "But of that day or of that hour no one knows, neither the angels who are in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father.",
    "Mark 13:33": "Take heed, watch and pray, for ye do not know when the time is:",
    "Mark 13:34": "[it is] as a man gone out of the country, having left his house and given to his bondmen the authority, and to each one his work, and commanded the doorkeeper that he should watch.",
    "Mark 13:35": "Watch therefore, for ye do not know when the master of the house comes: evening, or midnight, or cock-crow, or morning;",
    "Mark 13:36": "lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.",
    "Mark 13:37": "But what I say to you, I say to all, Watch.",
    "Mark 14:1": "Now the passover and the [feast of] unleavened bread was after two days. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might seize him by subtlety and kill him.",
    "Mark 14:2": "For they said, Not in the feast, lest perhaps there be a tumult of the people.",
    "Mark 14:3": "And when he was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he lay at table, there came a woman having an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard, very costly; and having broken the alabaster flask, she poured it out upon his head.",
    "Mark 14:4": "And there were some indignant in themselves, and saying, Why has this waste been made of the ointment?",
    "Mark 14:5": "for this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor. And they spoke very angrily at her.",
    "Mark 14:6": "But Jesus said, Let her alone; why do ye trouble her? she has wrought a good work as to me;",
    "Mark 14:7": "for ye have the poor always with you, and whenever ye would ye can do them good; but me ye have not always.",
    "Mark 14:8": "What she could she has done. She has beforehand anointed my body for the burial.",
    "Mark 14:9": "And verily I say unto you, Wheresoever these glad tidings may be preached in the whole world, what this [woman] has done shall be also spoken of for a memorial of her.",
    "Mark 14:10": "And Judas Iscariote, one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests that he might deliver him up to them;",
    "Mark 14:11": "and they, when they heard it, rejoiced, and promised him to give money. And he sought how he could opportunely deliver him up.",
    "Mark 14:12": "And the first day of unleavened bread, when they slew the passover, his disciples say to him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare, that thou mayest eat the passover?",
    "Mark 14:13": "And he sends two of his disciples, and says to them, Go into the city, and a man shall meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him.",
    "Mark 14:14": "And wheresoever he enters, say to the master of the house, The Teacher says, Where is my guest-chamber where I may eat the passover with my disciples?",
    "Mark 14:15": "and he will shew you a large upper room furnished ready. There make ready for us.",
    "Mark 14:16": "And his disciples went away and came into the city, and found as he had said to them; and they made ready the passover.",
    "Mark 14:17": "And when evening was come, he comes with the twelve.",
    "Mark 14:18": "And as they lay at table and were eating, Jesus said, Verily I say to you, One of you shall deliver me up; he who is eating with me.",
    "Mark 14:19": "And they began to be grieved, and to say to him, one by one, Is it I? [and another, Is it I?]",
    "Mark 14:20": "But he answered and said to them, One of the twelve, he who dips with me in the dish.",
    "Mark 14:21": "The Son of man goes indeed as it is written concerning him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is delivered up; [it were] good for that man if he had not been born.",
    "Mark 14:22": "And as they were eating, Jesus, having taken bread, when he had blessed, broke [it], and gave [it] to them, and said, Take [this]: this is my body.",
    "Mark 14:23": "And having taken [the] cup, when he had given thanks, he gave [it] to them, and they all drank out of it.",
    "Mark 14:24": "And he said to them, This is my blood, that of the [new] covenant, that shed for many.",
    "Mark 14:25": "Verily I say to you, I will no more drink at all of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.",
    "Mark 14:26": "And having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.",
    "Mark 14:27": "And Jesus says to them, All ye shall be offended, for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered abroad.",
    "Mark 14:28": "But after I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.",
    "Mark 14:29": "But Peter said to him, Even if all should be offended, yet not I.",
    "Mark 14:30": "And Jesus says to him, Verily I say to thee, that thou to-day, in this night, before [the] cock shall crow twice, thou shalt thrice deny me.",
    "Mark 14:31": "But he said [so much] exceedingly the more, If I should have to die with thee, I will in no wise deny thee. And likewise said they all too.",
    "Mark 14:32": "And they come to a place of which the name [is] Gethsemane, and he says to his disciples, Sit here while I shall pray.",
    "Mark 14:33": "And he takes with him Peter and James and John, and he began to be amazed and oppressed in spirit.",
    "Mark 14:34": "And he says to them, My soul is full of grief even unto death; abide here and watch.",
    "Mark 14:35": "And, going forward a little, he fell upon the earth; and he prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him.",
    "Mark 14:36": "And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee: take away this cup from me; but not what I will, but what thou [wilt].",
    "Mark 14:37": "And he comes and finds them sleeping. And he says to Peter, Simon, dost thou sleep? Hast thou not been able to watch one hour?",
    "Mark 14:38": "Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed [is] willing, but the flesh weak.",
    "Mark 14:39": "And going away, he prayed again, saying the same thing.",
    "Mark 14:40": "And returning, he found them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy; and they knew not what they should answer him.",
    "Mark 14:41": "And he comes the third time and says to them, Sleep on now, and take your rest. It is enough; the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is delivered up into the hands of sinners.",
    "Mark 14:42": "Arise, let us go; behold, he that delivers me up has drawn nigh.",
    "Mark 14:43": "And immediately, while he was yet speaking, Judas comes up, [being] one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd, with swords and sticks, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.",
    "Mark 14:44": "Now he that delivered him up had given them a sign between them, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he; seize him, and lead [him] away safely.",
    "Mark 14:45": "And being come, straightway coming up to him, he says, Rabbi, Rabbi; and he covered him with kisses.",
    "Mark 14:46": "And they laid their hands upon him and seized him.",
    "Mark 14:47": "But a certain one of those who stood by, having drawn his sword, struck the bondman of the high priest, and took off his ear.",
    "Mark 14:48": "And Jesus answering said to them, Are ye come out as against a robber, with swords and sticks to take me?",
    "Mark 14:49": "I was daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye did not seize me; but [it is] that the scriptures may be fulfilled.",
    "Mark 14:50": "And all left him and fled.",
    "Mark 14:51": "And a certain young man followed him with a linen cloth cast about his naked [body]; and [the young men] seize him;",
    "Mark 14:52": "but he, leaving the linen cloth behind [him], fled from them naked.",
    "Mark 14:53": "And they led away Jesus to the high priest. And there come together to him all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.",
    "Mark 14:54": "And Peter followed him at a distance, till [he was] within the court of the high priest’s palace; and he was sitting with the officers and warming himself in the light [of the fire].",
    "Mark 14:55": "And the chief priests and the whole sanhedrim sought testimony against Jesus to cause him to be put to death, and did not find [any].",
    "Mark 14:56": "For many bore false witness against him, and their testimony did not agree.",
    "Mark 14:57": "And certain persons rose up and bore false witness against him, saying,",
    "Mark 14:58": "We heard him saying, I will destroy this temple which is made with hands, and in the course of three days I will build another not made with hands.",
    "Mark 14:59": "And neither thus did their testimony agree.",
    "Mark 14:60": "And the high priest, rising up before them all, asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? What do these testify against thee?",
    "Mark 14:61": "But he was silent, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and says to him, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?",

    "Mark 14:69": "And the maid, seeing him, again began to say to those that stood by, This is [one] of them.",
    "Mark 14:70": "And he again denied. And again, after a little, those that stood by said to Peter, Truly thou art [one] of them, for also thou art a Galilean.",
    "Mark 14:71": "But he began to curse and to swear, I know not this man of whom ye speak.",
    "Mark 14:72": "And the second time a cock crew. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus said to him, Before [the] cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice; and when he thought thereon he wept.",

    "Mark 15:3": "And the chief priests accused him urgently.",
    "Mark 15:4": "And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? See of how many things they bear witness against thee.",
    "Mark 15:5": "But Jesus still answered nothing, so that Pilate marvelled.",
    "Mark 15:6": "But at [the] feast he released to them one prisoner, whomsoever they begged [of him].",
    "Mark 15:7": "Now there was the [person] named Barabbas bound with those who had made insurrection with [him], [and] that had committed murder in the insurrection.",
    "Mark 15:8": "And the crowd crying out began to beg [that he would do] to them as he had always done.",

    "Luke 9:21": "But, earnestly charging them, he enjoined [them] to say this to no man,",
    "Luke 9:22": "saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.",
    "Luke 9:23": "And he said to [them] all, If any one will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me;",
    "Luke 9:24": "for whosoever shall desire to save his life shall lose it, but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, he shall save it.",
    "Luke 9:25": "For what shall a man profit if he shall have gained the whole world, and have destroyed, or come under the penalty of the loss of himself?",
    "Luke 9:26": "For whosoever shall have been ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of man be ashamed when he shall come in his glory, and [in that] of the Father, and of the holy angels.",

    "Luke 9:34": "But as he was saying these things, there came a cloud and overshadowed them, and they feared as they entered into the cloud:",
    "Luke 9:35": "and there was a voice out of the cloud saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.",
    "Luke 9:36": "And as the voice was [heard] Jesus was found alone: and they kept silence, and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen.",
    "Luke 9:37": "And it came to pass on the following day, when they came down from the mountain, a great crowd met him.",
    "Luke 9:38": "And lo, a man from the crowd cried out saying, Teacher, I beseech thee look upon my son, for he is mine only child:",

    "Luke 9:40": "And I besought thy disciples that they might cast him out, and they could not.",
    "Luke 9:41": "And Jesus answering said, O unbelieving and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you and suffer you? Bring hither thy son.",
    "Luke 9:42": "But as he was yet coming, the demon tore him and dragged him all together. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child and gave him back to his father.",
    "Luke 9:43": "And all were astonished at the glorious greatness of God. And as all wondered at all the things which [Jesus] did, he said to his disciples,",
    "Luke 9:44": "Do ye let these words sink into your ears. For the Son of man is about to be delivered into men’s hands.",
    "Luke 9:45": "But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them that they should not perceive it. And they feared to ask him concerning this saying.",
    "Luke 9:46": "And a reasoning came in amongst them, who should be [the] greatest of them.",
    "Luke 9:47": "And Jesus, seeing the reasoning of their heart, having taken a little child set it by him,",
    "Luke 9:48": "and said to them, Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receives me, and whosoever shall receive me receives him that sent me. For he who is the least among you all, he is great.",
    "Luke 9:49": "And John answering said, Master, we saw some one casting out demons in thy name, and we forbad him, because he follows not with us.",
    "Luke 9:50": "And Jesus said to him, Forbid [him] not, for he that is not against you is for you.",
    "Luke 9:51": "And it came to pass when the days of his receiving up were fulfilled, that he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem.",
    "Luke 9:52": "And he sent messengers before his face. And having gone they entered into a village of the Samaritans that they might make ready for him.",
    "Luke 9:53": "And they did not receive him, because his face was [turned as] going to Jerusalem.",
    "Luke 9:54": "And his disciples James and John seeing [it] said, Lord, wilt thou that we speak [that] fire come down from heaven and consume them, as also Elias did?",
    "Luke 9:55": "But turning he rebuked them [and said, Ye know not of what spirit ye are].",
    "Luke 9:56": "And they went to another village.",
    "Luke 9:57": "And it came to pass as they went in the way, one said to him, I will follow thee wheresoever thou goest, Lord.",
    "Luke 9:58": "And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes and the birds of the heaven roosting-places, but the Son of man has not where he may lay his head.",
    "Luke 9:59": "And he said to another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, allow me to go first and bury my father.",
    "Luke 9:60": "But Jesus said to him, Suffer the dead to bury their own dead, but do thou go and announce the kingdom of God.",
    "Luke 9:61": "And another also said, I will follow thee, Lord, but first allow me to bid adieu to those at my house.",
    "Luke 9:62": "But Jesus said to him, No one having laid his hand on [the] plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God.",

    "Luke 10:7": "And in the same house abide, eating and drinking such things as they have; for the workman is worthy of his hire. Remove not from house to house.",
    "Luke 10:8": "And into whatsoever city ye may enter and they receive you, eat what is set before you,",
    "Luke 10:9": "and heal the sick in it, and say to them, The kingdom of God is come nigh to you.",
    "Luke 10:10": "But into whatsoever city ye may have entered and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say,",

    "Luke 10:29": "But he, desirous of justifying himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbour?",
    "Luke 10:30": "And Jesus replying said, A certain man descended from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell into [the hands of] robbers, who also, having stripped him and inflicted wounds, went away leaving him in a half-dead state.",
    "Luke 10:31": "And a certain priest happened to go down that way, and seeing him, passed on on the opposite side;",
    "Luke 10:32": "and in like manner also a Levite, being at the spot, came and looked [at him] and passed on on the opposite side.",

    "Luke 18:10": "Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax-gatherer.",
    "Luke 18:11": "The Pharisee, standing, prayed thus to himself: God, I thank thee that I am not as the rest of men, rapacious, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax-gatherer.",

    "Luke 18:23": "But when he heard this he became very sorrowful, for he was very rich.",
    "Luke 18:24": "But when Jesus saw that he became very sorrowful, he said, How difficultly shall those who have riches enter into the kingdom of God;",

    "Luke 19:9": "And Jesus said to him, To-day salvation is come to this house, inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham;",
    "Luke 19:10": "for the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which is lost.",
    "Luke 19:11": "But as they were listening to these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem and they thought that the kingdom of God was about to be immediately manifested.",
    "Luke 19:12": "He said therefore, A certain high-born man went to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and return.",
    "Luke 19:13": "And having called his own ten bondmen, he gave to them ten minas, and said to them, Trade while I am coming.",

    "Luke 19:20": "And another came, saying, [My] Lord, lo, [there is] thy mina, which I have kept laid up in a towel.",
    "Luke 19:21": "For I feared thee because thou art a harsh man: thou takest up what thou hast not laid down, and thou reapest what thou hast not sowed.",
    "Luke 19:22": "He says to him, Out of thy mouth will I judge thee, wicked bondman: thou knewest that I am a harsh man, taking up what I have not laid down and reaping what I have not sowed.",
    "Luke 19:23": "And why didst thou not give my money to [the] bank; and I should have received it, at my coming, with interest?",

    "Luke 20:4": "The baptism of John, was it of heaven or of men?",
    "Luke 20:5": "And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we should say, Of heaven, he will say, Why have ye not believed him?",

    "John 4:7": "A woman comes out of Samaria to draw water. Jesus says to her, Give me to drink",
    "John 4:8": "(for his disciples had gone away into the city that they might buy provisions).",
    "John 4:9": "The Samaritan woman therefore says to him, How dost thou, being a Jew, ask to drink of me who am a Samaritan woman? for Jews have no intercourse with Samaritans.",
    "John 4:10": "Jesus answered and said to her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.",
    "John 4:11": "The woman says to him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou the living water?",
    "John 4:12": "Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his sons, and his cattle?",
    "John 4:13": "Jesus answered and said to her, Every one who drinks of this water shall thirst again;",
    "John 4:14": "but whosoever drinks of the water which I shall give him shall never thirst for ever, but the water which I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life.",
    "John 4:15": "The woman says to him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst nor come here to draw.",
    "John 4:16": "Jesus says to her, Go, call thy husband, and come here.",
    "John 4:17": "The woman answered and said, I have not a husband. Jesus says to her, Thou hast well said, I have not a husband;",
    "John 4:18": "for thou hast had five husbands, and he whom now thou hast is not thy husband: this thou hast spoken truly.",
    "John 4:19": "The woman says to him, Sir, I see that thou art a prophet.",
    "John 4:20": "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where one must worship.",
    "John 4:21": "Jesus says to her, Woman, believe me, [the] hour is coming when ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father.",
    "John 4:22": "Ye worship ye know not what; we worship what we know, for salvation is of the Jews.",
    "John 4:23": "But [the] hour is coming and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth; for also the Father seeks such as his worshippers.",

    "John 4:31": "But meanwhile the disciples asked him saying, Rabbi, eat.",
    "John 4:32": "But he said to them, I have food to eat which ye do not know.",
    "John 4:33": "The disciples therefore said to one another, Has any one brought him [anything] to eat?",
    "John 4:34": "Jesus says to them, My food is that I should do the will of him that has sent me, and that I should finish his work.",
    "John 4:35": "Do not ye say, that there are yet four months and the harvest comes? Behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes and behold the fields, for they are already white to harvest.",
    "John 4:36": "He that reaps receives wages and gathers fruit unto life eternal, that both he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together.",
    "John 4:37": "For in this is [verified] the true saying, It is one who sows and another who reaps.",

    "John 4:41": "And more a great deal believed on account of his word;",
    "John 4:42": "and they said to the woman, [It is] no longer on account of thy saying that we believe, for we have heard him ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.",
    "John 4:43": "But after the two days he went forth thence and went away into Galilee,",
    "John 4:44": "for Jesus himself bore witness that a prophet has no honour in his own country.",
    "John 4:45": "When therefore he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem during the feast, for they also went to the feast.",
    "John 4:46": "He came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain courtier in Capernaum whose son was sick.",
    "John 4:47": "He, having heard that Jesus had come out of Judaea into Galilee, went to him and asked [him] that he would come down and heal his son, for he was about to die.",
    "John 4:48": "Jesus therefore said to him, Unless ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe.",
    "John 4:49": "The courtier says to him, Sir, come down ere my child die.",
    "John 4:50": "Jesus says to him, Go, thy son lives. And the man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and went his way.",
    "John 4:51": "But already, as he was going down, his servants met him and brought [him] word saying, Thy child lives.",
    "John 4:52": "He inquired therefore from them the hour at which he got better. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.",
    "John 4:53": "The father therefore knew that [it was] in that hour in which Jesus said to him, Thy son lives; and he believed, himself and his whole house.",
    "John 4:54": "This second sign again did Jesus, being come out of Judaea into Galilee.",
    "John 5:1": "After these things was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.",
    "John 5:2": "Now there is in Jerusalem, at the sheepgate, a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches.",
    "John 5:3": "In these lay a multitude of sick, blind, lame, withered, [awaiting the moving of the water.",
    "John 5:4": "For an angel descended at a certain season in the pool and troubled the water. Whoever therefore first went in after the troubling of the water became well, whatever disease he laboured under.]",
    "John 5:5": "But there was a certain man there who had been suffering under his infirmity thirty and eight years.",
    "John 5:6": "Jesus seeing this [man] lying [there], and knowing that he was [in that state] now a great length of time, says to him, Wouldest thou become well?",
    "John 5:7": "The infirm [man] answered him, Sir, I have not a man, in order, when the water has been troubled, to cast me into the pool; but while I am coming another descends before me.",
    "John 5:8": "Jesus says to him, Arise, take up thy couch and walk.",
    "John 5:9": "And immediately the man became well, and took up his couch and walked: and on that day was sabbath.",
    "John 5:10": "The Jews therefore said to the healed [man], It is sabbath, it is not permitted thee to take up thy couch.",
    "John 5:11": "He answered them, He that made me well, he said to me, Take up thy couch and walk.",
    "John 5:12": "They asked him [therefore], Who is the man who said to thee, Take up thy couch and walk?",
    "John 5:13": "But he that had been healed knew not who it was, for Jesus had slidden away, there being a crowd in the place.",
    "John 5:14": "After these things Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, thou art become well: sin no more, that something worse do not happen to thee.",
    "John 5:15": "The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.",
    "John 5:16": "And for this the Jews persecuted Jesus [and sought to kill him], because he had done these things on sabbath.",
    "John 5:17": "But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto and I work.",
    "John 5:18": "For this therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he had not only violated the sabbath, but also said that God was his own Father, making himself equal with God.",
    "John 5:19": "Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself save whatever he sees the Father doing: for whatever things he does, these things also the Son does in like manner.",
    "John 5:20": "For the Father loves the Son and shews him all things which he himself does; and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may wonder.",
    "John 5:21": "For even as the Father raises the dead and quickens [them], thus the Son also quickens whom he will:",
    "John 5:22": "for neither does the Father judge any one, but has given all judgment to the Son;",
    "John 5:23": "that all may honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He who honours not the Son, honours not the Father who has sent him.",
    "John 5:24": "Verily, verily, I say unto you, that he that hears my word, and believes him that has sent me, has life eternal, and does not come into judgment, but is passed out of death into life.",
    "John 5:25": "Verily, verily, I say unto you, that an hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that have heard shall live.",
    "John 5:26": "For even as the Father has life in himself, so he has given to the Son also to have life in himself,",
    "John 5:27": "and has given him authority to execute judgment [also], because he is Son of man.",
    "John 5:28": "Wonder not at this, for an hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs shall hear his voice,",
    "John 5:29": "and shall go forth; those that have practised good, to resurrection of life, and those that have done evil, to resurrection of judgment.",
    "John 5:30": "I cannot do anything of myself; as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous, because I do not seek my will, but the will of him that has sent me.",
    "John 5:31": "If I bear witness concerning myself, my witness is not true.",
    "John 5:32": "It is another who bears witness concerning me, and I know that the witness which he bears concerning me is true.",
    "John 5:33": "Ye have sent unto John, and he has borne witness to the truth.",
    "John 5:34": "But I do not receive witness from man, but I say this that ye might be saved.",
    "John 5:35": "He was the burning and shining lamp, and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.",
    "John 5:36": "But I have the witness [that is] greater than [that] of John; for the works which the Father has given me that I should complete them, the works themselves which I do, bear witness concerning me that the Father has sent me.",
    "John 5:37": "And the Father who has sent me himself has borne witness concerning me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor have seen his shape,",
    "John 5:38": "and ye have not his word abiding in you; for whom he hath sent, him ye do not believe.",
    "John 5:39": "Ye search the scriptures, for ye think that in them ye have life eternal, and they it is which bear witness concerning me;",
    "John 5:40": "and ye will not come to me that ye might have life.",
    "John 5:41": "I do not receive glory from men,",
    "John 5:42": "but I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.",
    "John 5:43": "I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not; if another come in his own name, him ye will receive.",
    "John 5:44": "How can ye believe, who receive glory one of another, and seek not the glory which [comes] from God alone?",
    "John 5:45": "Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is [one] who accuses you, Moses, on whom ye trust;",
    "John 5:46": "for if ye had believed Moses, ye would have believed me, for he wrote of me.",
    "John 5:47": "But if ye do not believe his writings, how shall ye believe my words?",
    "John 6:1": "After these things Jesus went away beyond the sea of Galilee, [or] of Tiberias,",
    "John 6:2": "and a great crowd followed him, because they saw the signs which he wrought upon the sick.",
    "John 6:3": "And Jesus went up into the mountain, and there sat with his disciples:",
    "John 6:4": "but the passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.",
    "John 6:5": "Jesus then, lifting up his eyes and seeing that a great crowd is coming to him, says to Philip, Whence shall we buy loaves that these may eat?",
    "John 6:6": "But this he said trying him, for he knew what he was going to do.",
    "John 6:7": "Philip answered him, Loaves for two hundred denarii are not sufficient for them, that each may have some little [portion].",
    "John 6:8": "One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, says to him,",
    "John 6:9": "There is a little boy here who has five barley loaves and two small fishes; but this, what is it for so many?",
    "John 6:10": "[And] Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place: the men therefore sat down, in number about five thousand.",
    "John 6:11": "And Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks, distributed [them] to those that were set down; and in like manner of the small fishes as much as they would.",
    "John 6:12": "And when they had been filled, he says to his disciples, Gather together the fragments which are over and above, that nothing may be lost.",
    "John 6:13": "They gathered [them] therefore together, and filled twelve hand-baskets full of fragments of the five barley loaves, which were over and above to those that had eaten.",
    "John 6:14": "The men therefore, having seen the sign which Jesus had done, said, This is truly the prophet which is coming into the world.",
    "John 6:15": "Jesus therefore knowing that they were going to come and seize him, that they might make [him] king, departed again to the mountain himself alone.",
    "John 6:16": "But when evening was come, his disciples went down to the sea,",
    "John 6:17": "and having gone on board ship, they went over the sea to Capernaum. And it had already become dark, and Jesus had not come to them,",
    "John 6:18": "and the sea was agitated by a strong wind blowing.",
    "John 6:19": "Having rowed then about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they see Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the ship; and they were frightened.",
    "John 6:20": "But he says to them, It is I: be not afraid.",
    "John 6:21": "They were willing therefore to receive him into the ship; and immediately the ship was at the land to which they went.",
    "John 6:22": "On the morrow the crowd which stood on the other side of the sea, having seen that there was no other little ship there except that into which his disciples had got, and that Jesus had not gone with his disciples into the ship, but [that] his disciples had gone away alone;",
    "John 6:23": "(but other little ships out of Tiberias came near to the place where they ate bread after the Lord had given thanks;)",
    "John 6:24": "when therefore the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they got into the ships, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.",
    "John 6:25": "And having found him the other side of the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when art thou arrived here?",
    "John 6:26": "Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say to you, Ye seek me not because ye have seen signs, but because ye have eaten of the loaves and been filled.",
    "John 6:27": "Work not [for] the food which perishes, but [for] the food which abides unto life eternal, which the Son of man shall give to you; for him has the Father sealed, [even] God.",
    "John 6:28": "They said therefore to him, What should we do that we may work the works of God?",
    "John 6:29": "Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he has sent.",
    "John 6:30": "They said therefore to him, What sign then doest thou that we may see and believe thee? what dost thou work?",
    "John 6:31": "Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.",
    "John 6:32": "Jesus therefore said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, [It is] not Moses that has given you the bread out of heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.",
    "John 6:33": "For the bread of God is he who comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world.",
    "John 6:34": "They said therefore to him, Lord, ever give to us this bread.",
    "John 6:35": "[And] Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he that comes to me shall never hunger, and he that believes on me shall never thirst at any time.",
    "John 6:36": "But I have said to you, that ye have also seen me and do not believe.",
    "John 6:37": "All that the Father gives me shall come to me, and him that comes to me I will not at all cast out.",
    "John 6:38": "For I am come down from heaven, not that I should do my will, but the will of him that has sent me.",
    "John 6:39": "And this is the will of him that has sent me, that of all that he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up in the last day.",
    "John 6:40": "For this is the will of my Father, that every one who sees the Son, and believes on him, should have life eternal; and I will raise him up at the last day.",
    "John 6:41": "The Jews therefore murmured about him, because he said, I am the bread which has come down out of heaven.",
    "John 6:42": "And they said, Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we have known? how then does he say, I am come down out of heaven?",
    "John 6:43": "Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Murmur not among yourselves.",
    "John 6:44": "No one can come to me except the Father who has sent me draw him, and I will raise him up in the last day.",
    "John 6:45": "It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every one that has heard from the Father [himself], and has learned [of him], comes to me;",
    "John 6:46": "not that any one has seen the Father, except he who is of God, he has seen the Father.",
    "John 6:47": "Verily, verily, I say to you, He that believes [on me] has life eternal.",
    "John 6:48": "I am the bread of life.",
    "John 6:49": "Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and died.",
    "John 6:50": "This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that one may eat of it and not die.",
    "John 6:51": "I am the living bread which has come down out of heaven: if any one shall have eaten of this bread he shall live for ever; but the bread withal which I shall give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.",
    "John 6:52": "The Jews therefore contended among themselves, saying, How can he give us this flesh to eat?",
    "John 6:53": "Jesus therefore said to them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Unless ye shall have eaten the flesh of the Son of man, and drunk his blood, ye have no life in yourselves.",
    "John 6:54": "He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has life eternal, and I will raise him up at the last day:",
    "John 6:55": "for my flesh is truly food and my blood is truly drink.",
    "John 6:56": "He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood dwells in me and I in him.",
    "John 6:57": "As the living Father has sent me and I live on account of the Father, he also who eats me shall live also on account of me.",
    "John 6:58": "This is the bread which has come down out of heaven. Not as the fathers ate and died: he that eats this bread shall live for ever.",
    "John 6:59": "These things he said in [the] synagogue, teaching in Capernaum.",
    "John 6:60": "Many therefore of his disciples having heard [it] said, This word is hard; who can hear it?",
    "John 6:61": "But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples murmur concerning this, said to them, Does this offend you?",
    "John 6:62": "If then ye see the Son of man ascending up where he was before?",
    "John 6:63": "It is the Spirit which quickens, the flesh profits nothing: the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.",
    "John 6:64": "But there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who would deliver him up.",
    "John 6:65": "And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no one can come to me unless it be given to him from the Father.",
    "John 6:66": "From that [time] many of his disciples went away back and walked no more with him.",
    "John 6:67": "Jesus therefore said to the twelve, Will ye also go away?",
    "John 6:68": "Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal;",
    "John 6:69": "and we have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God.",
    "John 6:70": "Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you the twelve? and of you one is a devil.",
    "John 6:71": "Now he spoke of Judas [the son] of Simon, Iscariote, for he [it was who] should deliver him up, being one of the twelve.",
    "John 7:1": "And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for he would not walk in Judaea, because the Jews sought to kill him.",
    "John 7:2": "Now the tabernacles, the feast of the Jews, was near.",
    "John 7:3": "His brethren therefore said to him, Remove hence and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou doest;",
    "John 7:4": "for no one does anything in secret and himself seeks to be [known] in public. If thou doest these things, manifest thyself to the world:",
    "John 7:5": "for neither did his brethren believe on him.",
    "John 7:6": "Jesus therefore says to them, My time is not yet come, but your time is always ready.",
    "John 7:7": "The world cannot hate you, but me it hates, because I bear witness concerning it that its works are evil.",
    "John 7:8": "Ye, go ye up to this feast. I go not up to this feast, for my time is not yet fulfilled.",
    "John 7:9": "Having said these things to them he abode in Galilee.",
    "John 7:10": "But when his brethren had gone up, then he himself also went up to the feast, not openly, but as in secret.",
    "John 7:11": "The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?",
    "John 7:12": "And there was much murmuring concerning him among the crowds. Some said, He is [a] good [man]; others said, No; but he deceives the crowd.",
    "John 7:13": "However, no one spoke openly concerning him on account of [their] fear of the Jews.",
    "John 7:14": "But when it was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.",
    "John 7:15": "The Jews therefore wondered, saying, How knows this [man] letters, having never learned?",
    "John 7:16": "Jesus therefore answered them and said, My doctrine is not mine, but [that] of him that has sent me.",
    "John 7:17": "If any one desire to practise his will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is of God, or [that] I speak from myself.",
    "John 7:18": "He that speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but he that seeks the glory of him that has sent him, he is true, and unrighteousness is not in him.",
    "John 7:19": "Has not Moses given you the law, and no one of you practises the law? Why do ye seek to kill me?",
    "John 7:20": "The crowd answered [and said], Thou hast a demon: who seeks to kill thee?",
    "John 7:21": "Jesus answered and said to them, I have done one work, and ye all wonder.",
    "John 7:22": "Therefore Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and ye circumcise a man on sabbath.",
    "John 7:23": "If a man receives circumcision on sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be violated, are ye angry with me because I have made a man entirely sound on sabbath?",
    "John 7:24": "Judge not according to sight, but judge righteous judgment.",
    "John 7:25": "Some therefore of those of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?",
    "John 7:26": "and behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Have the rulers then indeed recognised that this is the Christ?",
    "John 7:27": "But [as to] this [man] we know whence he is. Now [as to] the Christ, when he comes, no one knows whence he is.",
    "John 7:28": "Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me and ye know whence I am; and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye do not know.",
    "John 7:29": "I know him, because I am from him, and he has sent me.",
    "John 7:30": "They sought therefore to take him; and no one laid his hand upon him, because his hour had not yet come.",
    "John 7:31": "But many of the crowd believed on him, and said, Will the Christ, when he comes, do more signs than those which this [man] has done?",
    "John 7:32": "The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things concerning him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers that they might take him.",
    "John 7:33": "Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while I am with you, and I go to him that has sent me.",
    "John 7:34": "Ye shall seek me and shall not find [me], and where I am ye cannot come.",
    "John 7:35": "The Jews therefore said to one another, Where is he about to go that we shall not find him? Is he about to go to the dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?",
    "John 7:36": "What word is this which he said, Ye shall seek me and shall not find [me]; and where I am ye cannot come?",
    "John 7:37": "In the last, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried saying, If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink.",
    "John 7:38": "He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.",
    "John 7:39": "But this he said concerning the Spirit, which they that believed on him were about to receive; for [the] Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.",
    "John 7:40": "[Some] out of the crowd therefore, having heard this word, said, This is truly the prophet.",
    "John 7:41": "Others said, This is the Christ. Others said, Does then the Christ come out of Galilee?",
    "John 7:42": "Has not the scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David, and from the village of Bethlehem, where David was?",
    "John 7:43": "There was a division therefore in the crowd on account of him.",
    "John 7:44": "But some of them desired to take him, but no one laid hands upon him.",
    "John 7:45": "The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, Why have ye not brought him?",
    "John 7:46": "The officers answered, Never man spoke thus, as this man [speaks].",
    "John 7:47": "The Pharisees therefore answered them, Are ye also deceived?",
    "John 7:48": "Has any one of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees?",
    "John 7:49": "But this crowd, which does not know the law, are accursed.",
    "John 7:50": "Nicodemus says to them (being one of themselves),",
    "John 7:51": "Does our law judge a man before it have first heard from himself, and know what he does?",
    "John 7:52": "They answered and said to him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search and look, that no prophet arises out of Galilee.",
    "John 7:53": "And every one went to his home.",
    "John 8:1": "But Jesus went to the mount of Olives.",
    "John 8:2": "And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him; and he sat down and taught them.",
    "John 8:3": "And the scribes and the Pharisees bring [to him] a woman taken in adultery, and having set her in the midst,",
    "John 8:4": "they say to him, Teacher, this woman has been taken in the very act, committing adultery.",
    "John 8:5": "Now in the law Moses has commanded us to stone such; thou therefore, what sayest thou?",
    "John 8:6": "But this they said proving him, that they might have [something] to accuse him [of]. But Jesus, having stooped down, wrote with his finger on the ground.",
    "John 8:7": "But when they continued asking him, he lifted himself up and said to them, Let him that is without sin among you first cast the stone at her.",
    "John 8:8": "And again stooping down he wrote on the ground.",
    "John 8:9": "But they, having heard [that], went out one by one beginning from the elder ones until the last; and Jesus was left alone and the woman standing there.",
    "John 8:10": "And Jesus, lifting himself up and seeing no one but the woman, said to her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? Has no one condemned thee?",
    "John 8:11": "And she said, No one, sir. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.",
    "John 8:12": "Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.",
    "John 8:13": "The Pharisees therefore said to him, Thou bearest witness concerning thyself; thy witness is not true.",
    "John 8:14": "Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I bear witness concerning myself, my witness is true, because I know whence I came and whither I go: but ye know not whence I come and whither I go.",
    "John 8:15": "Ye judge according to the flesh, I judge no one.",
    "John 8:16": "And if also I judge, my judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who has sent me.",
    "John 8:17": "And in your law too it is written that the testimony of two men is true:",
    "John 8:18": "I am [one] who bear witness concerning myself, and the Father who has sent me bears witness concerning me.",
    "John 8:19": "They said to him therefore, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me nor my Father. If ye had known me, ye would have known also my Father.",
    "John 8:20": "These words spoke he in the treasury, teaching in the temple; and no one took him, for his hour was not yet come.",
    "John 8:21": "He said therefore again to them, I go away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin; where I go ye cannot come.",
    "John 8:22": "The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he says, Where I go ye cannot come?",
    "John 8:23": "And he said to them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above. Ye are of this world; I am not of this world.",
    "John 8:24": "I said therefore to you, that ye shall die in your sins; for unless ye shall believe that I am [he], ye shall die in your sins.",
    "John 8:25": "They said therefore to him, Who art thou? [And] Jesus said to them, Altogether that which I also say to you.",
    "John 8:26": "I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but he that has sent me is true, and I, what I have heard from him, these things I say to the world.",
    "John 8:27": "They knew not that he spoke to them of the Father.",
    "John 8:28": "Jesus therefore said to them, When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man, then ye shall know that I am [he], and [that] I do nothing of myself, but as the Father has taught me I speak these things.",
    "John 8:29": "And he that has sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, because I do always the things that are pleasing to him.",
    "John 8:30": "As he spoke these things many believed on him.",
    "John 8:31": "Jesus therefore said to the Jews who believed him, If ye abide in my word, ye are truly my disciples;",
    "John 8:32": "and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.",
    "John 8:33": "They answered him, We are Abraham’s seed, and have never been under bondage to any one; how sayest thou, Ye shall become free?",
    "John 8:34": "Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Every one that practises sin is the bondman of sin.",
    "John 8:35": "Now the bondman abides not in the house for ever: the son abides for ever.",
    "John 8:36": "If therefore the Son shall set you free, ye shall be really free.",
    "John 8:37": "I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word has no entrance in you.",

    "John 8:41": "Ye do the works of your father. They said [therefore] to him, We are not born of fornication; we have one father, God.",
    "John 8:42": "Jesus said to them, If God were your father ye would have loved me, for I came forth from God and am come [from him]; for neither am I come of myself, but he has sent me.",
    "John 8:43": "Why do ye not know my speech? Because ye cannot hear my word.",
    "John 8:44": "Ye are of the devil, as [your] father, and ye desire to do the lusts of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks falsehood, he speaks of what is his own; for he is a liar and its father:",
    "John 8:45": "and because I speak the truth, ye do not believe me.",
    "John 8:46": "Which of you convinces me of sin? If I speak truth, why do ye not believe me?",
    "John 8:47": "He that is of God hears the words of God: therefore ye hear [them] not, because ye are not of God.",
    "John 8:48": "The Jews answered and said to him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan and hast a demon?",
    "John 8:49": "Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honour my Father, and ye dishonour me.",
    "John 8:50": "But I do not seek my own glory: there is he that seeks and judges.",
    "John 8:51": "Verily, verily, I say unto you, If any one shall keep my word, he shall never see death.",
    "John 8:52": "The Jews therefore said to him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham has died, and the prophets, and thou sayest, If any one keep my word, he shall never taste death.",
    "John 8:53": "Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who has died? and the prophets have died: whom makest thou thyself?",
    "John 8:54": "Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father who glorifies me, [of] whom ye say, He is our God.",
    "John 8:55": "And ye know him not; but I know him; and if I said, I know him not, I should be like you, a liar. But I know him, and I keep his word.",
    "John 8:56": "Your father Abraham exulted in that he should see my day, and he saw and rejoiced.",
    "John 8:57": "The Jews therefore said to him, Thou hast not yet fifty years, and hast thou seen Abraham?",

    "John 9:6": "Having said these things, he spat on the ground and made mud of the spittle, and put the mud, as ointment, on his eyes.",
    "John 9:7": "And he said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, which is interpreted, Sent. He went therefore and washed, and came seeing.",
    "John 9:8": "The neighbours therefore, and those who used to see him before, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that was sitting and begging?",
    "John 9:9": "Some said, It is he; others said, No, but he is like him: he said, It is I.",
    "John 9:10": "They said therefore to him, How have thine eyes been opened?",
    "John 9:11": "He answered [and said], A man called Jesus made mud and anointed mine eyes, and said to me, Go to Siloam and wash: and having gone and washed, I saw.",
    "John 9:12": "They said therefore to him, Where is he? He says, I do not know.",
    "John 9:13": "They bring him who was before blind to the Pharisees.",
    "John 9:14": "Now it was sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.",

    "John 9:16": "Some of the Pharisees therefore said, This man is not of God, for he does not keep the sabbath. Others said, How can a sinful man perform such signs? And there was a division among them.",
    "John 9:17": "They say therefore again to the blind [man], What dost thou say of him, that he has opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.",
    "John 9:18": "The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him that he was blind and had received sight, until they had called the parents of him that had received sight.",
    "John 9:19": "And they asked them saying, This is your son, of whom ye say that he was born blind: how then does he now see?",
    "John 9:20": "His parents answered [them] and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;",
    "John 9:21": "but how he now sees we do not know, or who has opened his eyes we do not know. He is of age: ask him; he will speak concerning himself.",
    "John 9:22": "His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if any one confessed him [to be the] Christ, he should be excommunicated from the synagogue.",
    "John 9:23": "On this account his parents said, He is of age: ask him.",
    "John 9:24": "They called therefore a second time the man who had been blind, and said to him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is sinful.",
    "John 9:25": "He answered therefore, If he is sinful I know not. One thing I know, that, being blind [before], now I see.",
    "John 9:26": "And they said to him again, What did he do to thee? how opened he thine eyes?",
    "John 9:27": "He answered them, I told you already and ye did not hear: why do ye desire to hear again? do ye also wish to become his disciples?",
    "John 9:28": "They railed at him, and said, Thou art his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.",
    "John 9:29": "We know that God spoke to Moses; but [as to] this [man], we know not whence he is.",
    "John 9:30": "The man answered and said to them, Now in this is a wonderful thing, that ye do not know whence he is, and he has opened mine eyes.",
    "John 9:31": "[But] we know that God does not hear sinners; but if any one be God-fearing and do his will, him he hears.",
    "John 9:32": "Since time was, it has not been heard that any one opened the eyes of one born blind.",
    "John 9:33": "If this [man] were not of God he would be able to do nothing.",
    "John 9:34": "They answered and said to him, Thou hast been wholly born in sins, and thou teachest us? And they cast him out.",
    "John 9:35": "Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him, he said to him, Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God?",
    "John 9:36": "He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?",
    "John 9:37": "And Jesus said to him, Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he.",
    "John 9:38": "And he said, I believe, Lord: and he did him homage.",
    "John 9:39": "And Jesus said, For judgment am I come into this world, that they which see not may see, and they which see may become blind.",
    "John 9:40": "And [some] of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and they said to him, Are we blind also?",
    "John 9:41": "Jesus said to them, If ye were blind ye would not have sin; but now ye say, We see, your sin remains.",
    "John 10:1": "Verily, verily, I say to you, He that enters not in by the door to the fold of the sheep, but mounts up elsewhere, he is a thief and a robber;",
    "John 10:2": "but he that enters in by the door is [the] shepherd of the sheep.",
    "John 10:3": "To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.",
    "John 10:4": "When he has put forth all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.",
    "John 10:5": "But they will not follow a stranger, but will flee from him, because they know not the voice of strangers.",
    "John 10:6": "This allegory spoke Jesus to them, but they did not know what it was [of] which he spoke to them.",
    "John 10:7": "Jesus therefore said again to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.",
    "John 10:8": "All whoever came before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not hear them.",
    "John 10:9": "I am the door: if any one enter in by me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and shall go out and shall find pasture.",
    "John 10:10": "The thief comes not but that he may steal, and kill, and destroy: I am come that they might have life, and might have [it] abundantly.",
    "John 10:11": "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep:",
    "John 10:12": "but he who serves for wages, and who is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf seizes them and scatters the sheep.",
    "John 10:13": "Now he who serves for wages flees because he serves for wages, and is not himself concerned about the sheep.",
    "John 10:14": "I am the good shepherd; and I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine,",
    "John 10:15": "as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.",
    "John 10:16": "And I have other sheep which are not of this fold: those also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one flock, one shepherd.",
    "John 10:17": "On this account the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it again.",
    "John 10:18": "No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down and I have authority to take it again. I have received this commandment of my Father.",
    "John 10:19": "There was a division again among the Jews on account of these words;",
    "John 10:20": "but many of them said, He has a demon and raves; why do ye hear him?",
    "John 10:21": "Others said, These sayings are not [those] of one that is possessed by a demon. Can a demon open blind people’s eyes?",
    "John 10:22": "Now the feast of the dedication was celebrating at Jerusalem, and it was winter.",
    "John 10:23": "And Jesus walked in the temple in the porch of Solomon.",
    "John 10:24": "The Jews therefore surrounded him, and said to him, Until when dost thou hold our soul in suspense? If thou art the Christ, say [so] to us openly.",
    "John 10:25": "Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye do not believe. The works which I do in my Father’s name, these bear witness concerning me:",
    "John 10:26": "but ye do not believe, for ye are not of my sheep, as I told you.",
    "John 10:27": "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me;",
    "John 10:28": "and I give them life eternal; and they shall never perish, and no one shall seize them out of my hand.",
    "John 10:29": "My Father who has given [them] to me is greater than all, and no one can seize out of the hand of my Father.",
    "John 10:30": "I and the Father are one.",
    "John 10:31": "The Jews therefore again took stones that they might stone him.",
    "John 10:32": "Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewn you of my Father; for which work of them do ye stone me?",
    "John 10:33": "The Jews answered him, For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy, and because thou, being a man, makest thyself God.",
    "John 10:34": "Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?",
    "John 10:35": "If he called them gods to whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken),",
    "John 10:36": "do ye say of him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am Son of God?",
    "John 10:37": "If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not;",
    "John 10:38": "but if I do, even if ye believe not me, believe the works, that ye may know [and believe] that the Father is in me and I in him.",
    "John 10:39": "They sought therefore again to take him; and he went away from out of their hand",
    "John 10:40": "and departed again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was baptising at the first: and he abode there.",
    "John 10:41": "And many came to him, and said, John did no sign; but all things which John said of this [man] were true.",
    "John 10:42": "And many believed on him there.",
    "John 11:1": "Now there was a certain [man] sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and Martha her sister.",
    "John 11:2": "It was [the] Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.",
    "John 11:3": "The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.",
    "John 11:4": "But when Jesus heard [it], he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it.",
    "John 11:5": "Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.",
    "John 11:6": "When therefore he heard, He is sick, he remained two days then in the place where he was.",
    "John 11:7": "Then after this he says to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.",
    "John 11:8": "The disciples say to him, Rabbi, [even but] now the Jews sought to stone thee, and goest thou thither again?",
    "John 11:9": "Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any one walk in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world;",
    "John 11:10": "but if any one walk in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.",
    "John 11:11": "These things said he; and after this he says to them, Lazarus, our friend, is fallen asleep, but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.",
    "John 11:12": "The disciples therefore said to him, Lord, if he be fallen asleep, he will get well.",
    "John 11:13": "But Jesus spoke of his death, but they thought that he spoke of the rest of sleep.",
    "John 11:14": "Jesus therefore then said to them plainly, Lazarus has died.",
    "John 11:15": "And I rejoice on your account that I was not there, in order that ye may believe. But let us go to him.",
    "John 11:16": "Thomas therefore, called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.",
    "John 11:17": "Jesus therefore [on] arriving found him to have been four days already in the tomb.",
    "John 11:18": "Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia off,",
    "John 11:19": "and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, that they might console them concerning their brother.",
    "John 11:20": "Martha then, when she heard Jesus is coming, went to meet him; but Mary sat in the house.",
    "John 11:21": "Martha therefore said to Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died;",
    "John 11:22": "but even now I know, that whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee.",
    "John 11:23": "Jesus says to her, Thy brother shall rise again.",
    "John 11:24": "Martha says to him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day.",
    "John 11:25": "Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life: he that believes on me, though he have died, shall live;",
    "John 11:26": "and every one who lives and believes on me shall never die. Believest thou this?",
    "John 11:27": "She says to him, Yea, Lord; I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who should come into the world.",
    "John 11:28": "And having said this, she went away and called her sister Mary secretly, saying, The teacher is come and calls thee.",
    "John 11:29": "She, when she heard [that], rises up quickly and comes to him.",
    "John 11:30": "Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha came to meet him.",
    "John 11:31": "The Jews therefore who were with her in the house and consoling her, seeing Mary that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, She goes to the tomb, that she may weep there.",
    "John 11:32": "Mary therefore, when she came where Jesus was, seeing him, fell at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.",
    "John 11:33": "Jesus therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, was deeply moved in spirit, and was troubled,",
    "John 11:34": "and said, Where have ye put him? They say to him, Lord, come and see.",
    "John 11:35": "Jesus wept.",
    "John 11:36": "The Jews therefore said, Behold how he loved him!",
    "John 11:37": "And some of them said, Could not this [man], who has opened the eyes of the blind [man], have caused that this [man] also should not have died?",
    "John 11:38": "Jesus therefore, again deeply moved in himself, comes to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.",
    "John 11:39": "Jesus says, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the dead, says to him, Lord, he stinks already, for he is four days [there].",
    "John 11:40": "Jesus says to her, Did I not say to thee, that if thou shouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?",
    "John 11:41": "They took therefore the stone away. And Jesus lifted up his eyes on high and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me;",
    "John 11:42": "but I knew that thou always hearest me; but on account of the crowd who stand around I have said [it], that they may believe that thou hast sent me.",
    "John 11:43": "And having said this, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.",
    "John 11:44": "And the dead came forth, bound feet and hands with graveclothes, and his face was bound round with a handkerchief. Jesus says to them, Loose him and let him go.",
    "John 11:45": "Many therefore of the Jews who came to Mary and saw what he had done, believed on him;",
    "John 11:46": "but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.",
    "John 11:47": "The chief priests, therefore, and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What do we? for this man does many signs.",
    "John 11:48": "If we let him thus alone, all will believe on him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.",
    "John 11:49": "But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, Ye know nothing",
    "John 11:50": "nor consider that it is profitable for you that one man die for the people, and not that the whole nation perish.",
    "John 11:51": "But this he did not say of himself; but, being high priest that year, prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation;",
    "John 11:52": "and not for the nation only, but that he should also gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad.",
    "John 11:53": "From that day therefore they took counsel that they might kill him.",
    "John 11:54": "Jesus therefore walked no longer openly among the Jews, but went away thence into the country near the desert, to a city called Ephraim, and there he sojourned with the disciples.",
    "John 11:55": "But the passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, that they might purify themselves.",
    "John 11:56": "They sought therefore Jesus, and said among themselves, standing in the temple, What do ye think? that he will not come to the feast?",
    "John 11:57": "Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment that if any one knew where he was, he should make it known, that they might take him.",
    "John 12:1": "Jesus therefore, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where was the dead [man] Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from among [the] dead.",
    "John 12:2": "There therefore they made him a supper, and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those at table with him.",
    "John 12:3": "Mary therefore, having taken a pound of ointment of pure nard of great price, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair, and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.",
    "John 12:4": "One of his disciples therefore, Judas [son] of Simon, Iscariote, who was about to deliver him up, says,",
    "John 12:5": "Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?",
    "John 12:6": "But he said this, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief and had the bag, and carried what was put into [it].",
    "John 12:7": "Jesus therefore said, Suffer her to have kept this for the day of my preparation for burial;",
    "John 12:8": "for ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have not always.",
    "John 12:9": "A great crowd therefore of the Jews knew that he was there; and they came, not because of Jesus only, but also that they might see Lazarus whom he raised from among [the] dead.",
    "John 12:10": "But the chief priests took counsel that they might kill Lazarus also,",
    "John 12:11": "because many of the Jews went away on his account and believed on Jesus.",
    "John 12:12": "On the morrow a great crowd who came to the feast, having heard that Jesus is coming into Jerusalem,",
    "John 12:13": "took branches of palms and went out to meet him, and cried, Hosanna, blessed [is] he that comes in the name of [the] Lord, the King of Israel.",
    "John 12:14": "And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat upon it; as it is written,",
    "John 12:15": "Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt.",
    "John 12:16": "[Now] his disciples knew not these things at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him.",
    "John 12:17": "The crowd therefore that was with him bore witness because he had called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from among [the] dead.",
    "John 12:18": "Therefore also the crowd met him because they had heard that he had done this sign.",
    "John 12:19": "The Pharisees therefore said to one another, Ye see that ye profit nothing: behold, the world is gone after him.",
    "John 12:20": "And there were certain Greeks among those who came up that they might worship in the feast;",
    "John 12:21": "these therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and they asked him saying, Sir, we desire to see Jesus.",
    "John 12:22": "Philip comes and tells Andrew, [and again] Andrew comes and Philip, and they tell Jesus.",
    "John 12:23": "But Jesus answered them saying, The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified.",
    "John 12:24": "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it abides alone; but if it die, it bears much fruit.",
    "John 12:25": "He that loves his life shall lose it, and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal.",
    "John 12:26": "If any one serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall be my servant. [And] if any one serve me, him shall the Father honour.",
    "John 12:27": "Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But on account of this have I come to this hour.",
    "John 12:28": "Father, glorify thy name. There came therefore a voice out of heaven, I both have glorified and will glorify [it] again.",
    "John 12:29": "The crowd therefore, which stood [there] and heard [it], said that it had thundered. Others said, An angel has spoken to him.",
    "John 12:30": "Jesus answered and said, Not on my account has this voice come, but on yours.",
    "John 12:31": "Now is [the] judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out:",
    "John 12:32": "and I, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all to me.",
    "John 12:33": "But this he said signifying by what death he was about to die.",
    "John 12:34": "The crowd answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abides for ever; and how sayest thou that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this, the Son of man?",
    "John 12:35": "Jesus therefore said to them, Yet a little while is the light amongst you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness may not overtake you. And he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes.",
    "John 12:36": "While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may become sons of light. Jesus said these things, and going away hid himself from them.",
    "John 12:37": "But though he had done so many signs before them, they believed not on him,",
    "John 12:38": "that the word of the prophet Esaias which he said might be fulfilled, Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?",
    "John 12:39": "On this account they could not believe, because Esaias said again,",
    "John 12:40": "He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, that they may not see with their eyes, and understand with their heart and be converted, and I should heal them.",
    "John 12:41": "These things said Esaias because he saw his glory and spoke of him.",

    "Acts 26:2": "I count myself happy, king Agrippa, in having to answer to-day before thee concerning all of which I am accused by the Jews,",

    "Acts 26:24": "And as he answered for his defence with these things, Festus says with a loud voice, Thou art mad, Paul; much learning turns thee to madness.",
    "Acts 26:25": "But Paul said, I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but utter words of truth and soberness;",
    "Acts 26:26": "for the king is informed about these things, to whom also I speak with all freedom. For I am persuaded that of these things nothing is hidden from him; for this was not done in a corner.",
    "Acts 26:27": "King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.",
    "Acts 26:28": "And Agrippa [said] to Paul, In a little thou persuadest me to become a Christian.",
    "Acts 26:29": "And Paul [said], I would to God, both in little and in much, that not only thou, but all who have heard me this day, should become such as I also am, except these bonds.",
    "Acts 26:30": "And the king stood up, and the governor and Bernice, and those who sat with them,",

    "Romans 4:1": "What shall we say then that Abraham our father according to flesh has found?",
    "Romans 4:2": "For if Abraham has been justified on the principle of works, he has whereof to boast: but not before God;",
    "Romans 4:3": "for what does the scripture say? And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.",
    "Romans 4:4": "Now to him that works the reward is not reckoned as of grace, but of debt:",
    "Romans 4:5": "but to him who does not work, but believes on him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness.",
    "Romans 4:6": "Even as David also declares the blessedness of the man to whom God reckons righteousness without works:",
    "Romans 4:7": "Blessed [they] whose lawlessnesses have been forgiven, and whose sins have been covered:",
    "Romans 4:8": "blessed [the] man to whom [the] Lord shall not at all reckon sin.",
    "Romans 4:9": "[Does] this blessedness then [rest] on the circumcision, or also on the uncircumcision? For we say that faith has been reckoned to Abraham as righteousness.",
    "Romans 4:10": "How then has it been reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.",
    "Romans 4:11": "And he received [the] sign of circumcision [as] seal of the righteousness of faith which [he had] being in uncircumcision, that he might be [the] father of all them that believe being in uncircumcision, that righteousness might be reckoned to them also;",

    "Romans 4:13": "For [it was] not by law that the promise was to Abraham, or to his seed, that he should be heir of [the] world, but by righteousness of faith.",
    "Romans 4:14": "For if they which [are] of law be heirs, faith is made vain, and the promise made of no effect.",
    "Romans 4:15": "For law works wrath; but where no law is neither [is there] transgression.",
    "Romans 4:16": "Therefore [it is] on the principle of faith, that [it might be] according to grace, in order to the promise being sure to all the seed, not to that only which [is] of the law, but to that also which [is] of Abraham’s faith, who is father of us all,",
    "Romans 4:17": "(according as it is written, I have made thee father of many nations,) before the God whom he believed, who quickens the dead, and calls the things which be not as being;",
    "Romans 4:18": "who against hope believed in hope to his becoming father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be:",
    "Romans 4:19": "and not being weak in faith, he considered not his own body already become dead, being about a hundred years old, and the deadening of Sarah’s womb,",
    "Romans 4:20": "and hesitated not at the promise of God through unbelief; but found strength in faith, giving glory to God;",
    "Romans 4:21": "and being fully persuaded that what he has promised he is able also to do;",
    "Romans 4:22": "wherefore also it was reckoned to him as righteousness.",
    "Romans 4:23": "Now it was not written on his account alone that it was reckoned to him,",
    "Romans 4:24": "but on ours also, to whom, believing on him who has raised from among [the] dead Jesus our Lord,",
    "Romans 4:25": "who has been delivered for our offences and has been raised for our justification, it will be reckoned.",
    "Romans 5:1": "Therefore having been justified on the principle of faith, we have peace towards God through our Lord Jesus Christ;",
    "Romans 5:2": "by whom we have also access by faith into this favour in which we stand, and we boast in hope of the glory of God.",
    "Romans 5:3": "And not only [that], but we also boast in tribulations, knowing that tribulation works endurance;",
    "Romans 5:4": "and endurance, experience; and experience, hope;",
    "Romans 5:5": "and hope does not make ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by [the] Holy Spirit which has been given to us:",
    "Romans 5:6": "for we being still without strength, in [the] due time Christ has died for [the] ungodly.",
    "Romans 5:7": "For scarcely for [the] just [man] will one die, for perhaps for [the] good [man] some one might also dare to die;",
    "Romans 5:8": "but God commends his love to us, in that, we being still sinners, Christ has died for us.",
    "Romans 5:9": "Much rather therefore, having been now justified in [the power of] his blood, we shall be saved by him from wrath.",
    "Romans 5:10": "For if, being enemies, we have been reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much rather, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in [the power of] his life.",
    "Romans 5:11": "And not only [that], but [we are] making our boast in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom now we have received the reconciliation.",
    "Romans 5:12": "For this [cause], even as by one man sin entered into the world, and by sin death; and thus death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:",
    "Romans 5:13": "(for until law sin was in [the] world; but sin is not put to account when there is no law;",
    "Romans 5:14": "but death reigned from Adam until Moses, even upon those who had not sinned in the likeness of Adam’s transgression, who is [the] figure of him to come.",
    "Romans 5:15": "But [shall] not the act of favour [be] as the offence? For if by the offence of one the many have died, much rather has the grace of God, and the free gift in grace, which [is] by the one man Jesus Christ, abounded unto the many.",
    "Romans 5:16": "And [shall] not as by one that has sinned [be] the gift? For the judgment [was] of one to condemnation, but the act of favour, of many offences unto justification.",
    "Romans 5:17": "For if by the offence of the one death reigned by the one, much rather shall those who receive the abundance of grace, and of the free gift of righteousness, reign in life by the one Jesus Christ:)",
    "Romans 5:18": "so then as [it was] by one offence towards all men to condemnation, so by one righteousness towards all men for justification of life.",
    "Romans 5:19": "For as indeed by the disobedience of the one man the many have been constituted sinners, so also by the obedience of the one the many will be constituted righteous.",
    "Romans 5:20": "But law came in, in order that the offence might abound; but where sin abounded grace has overabounded,",
    "Romans 5:21": "in order that, even as sin has reigned in [the power of] death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.",
    "Romans 6:1": "What then shall we say? Should we continue in sin that grace may abound?",
    "Romans 6:2": "Far be the thought. We who have died to sin, how shall we still live in it?",
    "Romans 6:3": "Are you ignorant that we, as many as have been baptised unto Christ Jesus, have been baptised unto his death?",
    "Romans 6:4": "We have been buried therefore with him by baptism unto death, in order that, even as Christ has been raised up from among [the] dead by the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of life.",
    "Romans 6:5": "For if we are become identified with [him] in the likeness of his death, so also we shall be of [his] resurrection;",
    "Romans 6:6": "knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with [him], that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin.",
    "Romans 6:7": "For he that has died is justified from sin.",
    "Romans 6:8": "Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him,",
    "Romans 6:9": "knowing that Christ having been raised up from among [the] dead dies no more: death has dominion over him no more.",
    "Romans 6:10": "For in that he has died, he has died to sin once for all; but in that he lives, he lives to God.",
    "Romans 6:11": "So also ye, reckon yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.",
    "Romans 6:12": "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body to obey its lusts.",
    "Romans 6:13": "Neither yield your members instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but yield yourselves to God as alive from among [the] dead, and your members instruments of righteousness to God.",
    "Romans 6:14": "For sin shall not have dominion over you, for ye are not under law but under grace.",
    "Romans 6:15": "What then? should we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Far be the thought.",
    "Romans 6:16": "Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves bondmen for obedience, ye are bondmen to him whom ye obey, whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?",
    "Romans 6:17": "But thanks [be] to God, that ye were bondmen of sin, but have obeyed from the heart the form of teaching into which ye were instructed.",
    "Romans 6:18": "Now, having got your freedom from sin, ye have become bondmen to righteousness.",
    "Romans 6:19": "I speak humanly on account of the weakness of your flesh. For even as ye have yielded your members in bondage to uncleanness and to lawlessness unto lawlessness, so now yield your members in bondage to righteousness unto holiness.",
    "Romans 6:20": "For when ye were bondmen of sin ye were free from righteousness.",
    "Romans 6:21": "What fruit therefore had ye then in the things of which ye are now ashamed? for the end of them [is] death.",
    "Romans 6:22": "But now, having got your freedom from sin, and having become bondmen to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end eternal life.",
    "Romans 6:23": "For the wages of sin [is] death; but the act of favour of God, eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.",
    "Romans 7:1": "Are ye ignorant, brethren, (for I speak to those knowing law,) that law rules over a man as long as he lives?",
    "Romans 7:2": "For the married woman is bound by law to her husband so long as he is alive; but if the husband should die, she is clear from the law of the husband:",
    "Romans 7:3": "so then, the husband being alive, she shall be called an adulteress if she be to another man; but if the husband should die, she is free from the law, so as not to be an adulteress, though she be to another man.",
    "Romans 7:4": "So that, my brethren, ye also have been made dead to the law by the body of the Christ, to be to another, who has been raised up from among [the] dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God.",
    "Romans 7:5": "For when we were in the flesh the passions of sins, which [were] by the law, wrought in our members to bring forth fruit to death;",
    "Romans 7:6": "but now we are clear from the law, having died in that in which we were held, so that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in oldness of letter.",
    "Romans 7:7": "What shall we say then? [is] the law sin? Far be the thought. But I had not known sin, unless by law: for I had not had conscience also of lust unless the law had said, Thou shalt not lust;",
    "Romans 7:8": "but sin, getting a point of attack by the commandment, wrought in me every lust; for without law sin [was] dead.",
    "Romans 7:9": "But I was alive without law once; but the commandment having come, sin revived, but I died.",
    "Romans 7:10": "And the commandment, which [was] for life, was found, [as] to me, itself [to be] unto death:",
    "Romans 7:11": "for sin, getting a point of attack by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew [me].",
    "Romans 7:12": "So that the law indeed [is] holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.",
    "Romans 7:13": "Did then that which is good become death to me? Far be the thought. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death to me by that which is good; in order that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.",
    "Romans 7:14": "For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am fleshly, sold under sin.",
    "Romans 7:15": "For that which I do, I do not own: for not what I will, this I do; but what I hate, this I practise.",
    "Romans 7:16": "But if what I do not will, this I practise, I consent to the law that [it is] right.",
    "Romans 7:17": "Now then [it is] no longer I [that] do it, but the sin that dwells in me.",
    "Romans 7:18": "For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, good does not dwell: for to will is there with me, but to do right [I find] not.",
    "Romans 7:19": "For I do not practise the good that I will; but the evil I do not will, that I do.",
    "Romans 7:20": "But if what I do not will, this I practise, [it is] no longer I [that] do it, but the sin that dwells in me.",
    "Romans 7:21": "I find then the law upon me who will to practise what is right, that with me evil is there.",
    "Romans 7:22": "For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man:",
    "Romans 7:23": "but I see another law in my members, warring in opposition to the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which exists in my members.",
    "Romans 7:24": "O wretched man that I [am]! who shall deliver me out of this body of death?",
    "Romans 7:25": "I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then I myself with the mind serve God’s law; but with the flesh sin’s law.",
    "Romans 8:1": "[There is] then now no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus.",
    "Romans 8:2": "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and of death.",
    "Romans 8:3": "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, having sent his own Son, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh,",
    "Romans 8:4": "in order that the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh but according to Spirit.",
    "Romans 8:5": "For they that are according to flesh mind the things of the flesh; and they that are according to Spirit, the things of the Spirit.",
    "Romans 8:6": "For the mind of the flesh [is] death; but the mind of the Spirit life and peace.",
    "Romans 8:7": "Because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God; for neither indeed can it be:",
    "Romans 8:8": "and they that are in flesh cannot please God.",
    "Romans 8:9": "But ye are not in flesh but in Spirit, if indeed God’s Spirit dwell in you; but if any one has not [the] Spirit of Christ he is not of him:",
    "Romans 8:10": "but if Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin, but the Spirit life on account of righteousness.",
    "Romans 8:11": "But if the Spirit of him that has raised up Jesus from among [the] dead dwell in you, he that has raised up Christ from among [the] dead shall quicken your mortal bodies also on account of his Spirit which dwells in you.",
    "Romans 8:12": "So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to flesh;",
    "Romans 8:13": "for if ye live according to flesh, ye are about to die; but if, by the Spirit, ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live:",
    "Romans 8:14": "for as many as are led by [the] Spirit of God, these are sons of God.",
    "Romans 8:15": "For ye have not received a spirit of bondage again for fear, but ye have received a spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.",
    "Romans 8:16": "The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God.",
    "Romans 8:17": "And if children, heirs also: heirs of God, and Christ’s joint heirs; if indeed we suffer with [him], that we may also be glorified with [him].",
    "Romans 8:18": "For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy [to be compared] with the coming glory to be revealed to us.",
    "Romans 8:19": "For the anxious looking out of the creature expects the revelation of the sons of God:",
    "Romans 8:20": "for the creature has been made subject to vanity, not of its will, but by reason of him who has subjected [the same], in hope",
    "Romans 8:21": "that the creature itself also shall be set free from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.",
    "Romans 8:22": "For we know that the whole creation groans together and travails in pain together until now.",
    "Romans 8:23": "And not only [that], but even we ourselves, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, we also ourselves groan in ourselves, awaiting adoption, [that is] the redemption of our body.",
    "Romans 8:24": "For we have been saved in hope; but hope seen is not hope; for what any one sees, why does he also hope?",
    "Romans 8:25": "But if what we see not we hope, we expect in patience.",
    "Romans 8:26": "And in like manner the Spirit joins also its help to our weakness; for we do not know what we should pray for as is fitting, but the Spirit itself makes intercession with groanings which cannot be uttered.",
    "Romans 8:27": "But he who searches the hearts knows what [is] the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes for saints according to God.",
    "Romans 8:28": "But we do know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to purpose.",
    "Romans 8:29": "Because whom he has foreknown, he has also predestinated [to be] conformed to the image of his Son, so that he should be [the] firstborn among many brethren.",
    "Romans 8:30": "But whom he has predestinated, these also he has called; and whom he has called, these also he has justified; but whom he has justified, these also he has glorified.",
    "Romans 8:31": "What shall we then say to these things? If God [be] for us, who against us?",
    "Romans 8:32": "He who, yea, has not spared his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him grant us all things?",
    "Romans 8:33": "Who shall bring an accusation against God’s elect? [It is] God who justifies:",
    "Romans 8:34": "who is he that condemns? [It is] Christ who has died, but rather has been [also] raised up; who is also at the right hand of God; who also intercedes for us.",
    "Romans 8:35": "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? tribulation or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?",
    "Romans 8:36": "According as it is written, For thy sake we are put to death all the day long; we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter.",
    "Romans 8:37": "But in all these things we more than conquer through him that has loved us.",
    "Romans 8:38": "For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,",
    "Romans 8:39": "nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which [is] in Christ Jesus our Lord.",
    "Romans 9:1": "I say [the] truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing witness with me in [the] Holy Spirit,",
    "Romans 9:2": "that I have great grief and uninterrupted pain in my heart,",
    "Romans 9:3": "for I have wished, I myself, to be a curse from the Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen, according to flesh;",
    "Romans 9:4": "who are Israelites; whose [is] the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the law-giving, and the service, and the promises;",
    "Romans 9:5": "whose [are] the fathers; and of whom, as according to flesh, [is] the Christ, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.",
    "Romans 9:6": "Not however as though the word of God had failed; for not all [are] Israel which [are] of Israel;",
    "Romans 9:7": "nor because they are seed of Abraham [are] all children: but, In Isaac shall a seed be called to thee.",
    "Romans 9:8": "That is, [they that are] the children of the flesh, these [are] not the children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned as seed.",
    "Romans 9:9": "For this word [is] of promise, According to this time I will come, and there shall be a son to Sarah.",
    "Romans 9:10": "And not only [that], but Rebecca having conceived by one, Isaac our father,",
    "Romans 9:11": "[the children] indeed being not yet born, or having done anything good or worthless (that the purpose of God according to election might abide, not of works, but of him that calls),",
    "Romans 9:12": "it was said to her, The greater shall serve the less:",
    "Romans 9:13": "according as it is written, I have loved Jacob, and I have hated Esau.",
    "Romans 9:14": "What shall we say then? [Is there] unrighteousness with God? Far be the thought.",
    "Romans 9:15": "For he says to Moses, I will shew mercy to whom I will shew mercy, and I will feel compassion for whom I will feel compassion.",
    "Romans 9:16": "So then [it is] not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shews mercy.",
    "Romans 9:17": "For the scripture says to Pharaoh, For this very thing I have raised thee up from amongst [men], that I might thus shew in thee my power, and so that my name should be declared in all the earth.",
    "Romans 9:18": "So then, to whom he will he shews mercy, and whom he will he hardens.",
    "Romans 9:19": "Thou wilt say to me then, Why does he yet find fault? for who resists his purpose?",
    "Romans 9:20": "Aye, but thou, O man, who art thou that answerest again to God? Shall the thing formed say to him that has formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?",
    "Romans 9:21": "Or has not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make one vessel to honour, and another to dishonour?",
    "Romans 9:22": "And if God, minded to shew his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering vessels of wrath fitted for destruction;",
    "Romans 9:23": "and that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he had before prepared for glory,",
    "Romans 9:24": "us, whom he has also called, not only from amongst [the] Jews, but also from amongst [the] nations?",
    "Romans 9:25": "As he says also in Hosea, I will call not-my-people My people; and the-not-beloved Beloved.",
    "Romans 9:26": "And it shall be, in the place where it was said to them, Ye [are] not my people, there shall they be called Sons of [the] living God.",
    "Romans 9:27": "But Esaias cries concerning Israel, Should the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved:",
    "Romans 9:28": "for [he] is bringing the matter to an end, and [cutting [it] short in righteousness; because] a cutting short of the matter will [the] Lord accomplish upon the earth.",
    "Romans 9:29": "And according as Esaias said before, Unless [the] Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we had been as Sodom, and made like even as Gomorrha.",
    "Romans 9:30": "What then shall we say? That [they of the] nations, who did not follow after righteousness, have attained righteousness, but [the] righteousness that is on the principle of faith.",
    "Romans 9:31": "But Israel, pursuing after a law of righteousness, has not attained to [that] law.",
    "Romans 9:32": "Wherefore? Because [it was] not on the principle of faith, but as of works. They have stumbled at the stumblingstone,",
    "Romans 9:33": "according as it is written, Behold, I place in Zion a stone of stumbling and rock of offence: and he that believes on him shall not be ashamed.",
    "Romans 10:1": "Brethren, the delight of my own heart and my supplication which [I address] to God for them is for salvation.",
    "Romans 10:2": "For I bear them witness that they have zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.",
    "Romans 10:3": "For they, being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own [righteousness], have not submitted to the righteousness of God.",
    "Romans 10:4": "For Christ is [the] end of law for righteousness to every one that believes.",
    "Romans 10:5": "For Moses lays down in writing the righteousness which is of the law, The man who has practised those things shall live by them.",
    "Romans 10:6": "But the righteousness of faith speaks thus: Do not say in thine heart, Who shall ascend to the heavens? that is, to bring Christ down;",
    "Romans 10:7": "or, Who shall descend into the abyss? that is, to bring up Christ from among [the] dead.",
    "Romans 10:8": "But what says it? The word is near thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach:",
    "Romans 10:9": "that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord, and shalt believe in thine heart that God has raised him from among [the] dead, thou shalt be saved.",
    "Romans 10:10": "For with [the] heart is believed to righteousness; and with [the] mouth confession made to salvation.",
    "Romans 10:11": "For the scripture says, No one believing on him shall be ashamed.",
    "Romans 10:12": "For there is no difference of Jew and Greek; for the same Lord of all [is] rich towards all that call upon him.",
    "Romans 10:13": "For every one whosoever, who shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved.",
    "Romans 10:14": "How then shall they call upon him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe on him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without one who preaches?",
    "Romans 10:15": "and how shall they preach unless they have been sent? according as it is written, How beautiful the feet of them that announce glad tidings of peace, of them that announce glad tidings of good things!",
    "Romans 10:16": "But they have not all obeyed the glad tidings. For Esaias says, Lord, who has believed our report?",
    "Romans 10:17": "So faith then [is] by a report, but the report by God’s word.",
    "Romans 10:18": "But I say, Have they not heard? Yea, surely, Their voice has gone out into all the earth, and their words to the extremities of the habitable world.",
    "Romans 10:19": "But I say, Has not Israel known? First, Moses says, I will provoke you to jealousy through [them that are] not a nation: through a nation without understanding I will anger you.",
    "Romans 10:20": "But Esaias is very bold, and says, I have been found by those not seeking me; I have become manifest to those not inquiring after me.",
    "Romans 10:21": "But unto Israel he says, All the day long I have stretched out my hands unto a people disobeying and opposing.",
    "Romans 11:1": "I say then, Has God cast away his people? Far be the thought. For I also am an Israelite, of [the] seed of Abraham, of [the] tribe of Benjamin.",
    "Romans 11:2": "God has not cast away his people whom he foreknew. Know ye not what the scripture says in [the history of] Elias, how he pleads with God against Israel?",
    "Romans 11:3": "Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have dug down thine altars; and I have been left alone, and they seek my life.",
    "Romans 11:4": "But what says the divine answer to him? I have left to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed knee to Baal.",
    "Romans 11:5": "Thus, then, in the present time also there has been a remnant according to election of grace.",
    "Romans 11:6": "But if by grace, no longer of works: since [otherwise] grace is no more grace.",
    "Romans 11:7": "What [is it] then? What Israel seeks for, that he has not obtained; but the election has obtained, and the rest have been blinded,",
    "Romans 11:8": "according as it is written, God has given to them a spirit of slumber, eyes not to see, and ears not to hear, unto this day.",
    "Romans 11:9": "And David says, Let their table be for a snare, and for a gin, and for a fall-trap, and for a recompense to them:",
    "Romans 11:10": "let their eyes be darkened not to see, and bow down their back alway.",
    "Romans 11:11": "I say then, Have they stumbled in order that they might fall? Far be the thought: but by their fall [there is] salvation to the nations to provoke them to jealousy.",
    "Romans 11:12": "But if their fall [be the] world’s wealth, and their loss [the] wealth of [the] nations, how much rather their fulness?",
    "Romans 11:13": "For I speak to you, the nations, inasmuch as I am apostle of nations, I glorify my ministry;",
    "Romans 11:14": "if by any means I shall provoke to jealousy [them which are] my flesh, and shall save some from among them.",
    "Romans 11:15": "For if their casting away [be the] world’s reconciliation, what [their] reception but life from among [the] dead?",
    "Romans 11:16": "Now if the first-fruit [be] holy, the lump also; and if the root [be] holy, the branches also.",
    "Romans 11:17": "Now if some of the branches have been broken out, and thou, being a wild olive tree, hast been grafted in amongst them, and hast become a fellow-partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive tree,",
    "Romans 11:18": "boast not against the branches; but if thou boast, [it is] not thou bearest the root, but the root thee.",
    "Romans 11:19": "Thou wilt say then, The branches have been broken out in order that I might be grafted in.",
    "Romans 11:20": "Right: they have been broken out through unbelief, and thou standest through faith. Be not high-minded, but fear:",
    "Romans 11:21": "if God indeed has not spared the natural branches; lest it might be he spare not thee either.",
    "Romans 11:22": "Behold then [the] goodness and severity of God: upon them who have fallen, severity; upon thee goodness of God, if thou shalt abide in goodness, since [otherwise] thou also wilt be cut away.",
    "Romans 11:23": "And they too, if they abide not in unbelief, shall be grafted in; for God is able again to graft them in.",
    "Romans 11:24": "For if thou hast been cut out of the olive tree wild by nature, and, contrary to nature, hast been grafted into the good olive tree, how much rather shall they, who are according to nature be grafted into their own olive tree?",
    "Romans 11:25": "For I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, of this mystery, that ye may not be wise in your own conceits, that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the nations be come in;",
    "Romans 11:26": "and so all Israel shall be saved. According as it is written, The deliverer shall come out of Zion; he shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.",
    "Romans 11:27": "And this is the covenant from me to them, when I shall have taken away their sins.",
    "Romans 11:28": "As regards the glad tidings, [they are] enemies on your account; but as regards election, beloved on account of the fathers.",
    "Romans 11:29": "For the gifts and the calling of God [are] not subject to repentance.",
    "Romans 11:30": "For as indeed ye [also] once have not believed in God, but now have been objects of mercy through the unbelief of these;",
    "Romans 11:31": "so these also have now not believed in your mercy, in order that they also may be objects of mercy.",
    "Romans 11:32": "For God hath shut up together all in unbelief, in order that he might shew mercy to all.",
    "Romans 11:33": "O depth of riches both of [the] wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable his judgments, and untraceable his ways!",
    "Romans 11:34": "For who has known [the] mind of [the] Lord, or who has been his counsellor?",
    "Romans 11:35": "or who has first given to him, and it shall be rendered to him?",
    "Romans 11:36": "For of him, and through him, and for him [are] all things: to him be glory for ever. Amen.",
    "Romans 12:1": "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the compassions of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, [which is] your intelligent service.",
    "Romans 12:2": "And be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of [your] mind, that ye may prove what [is] the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.",
    "Romans 12:3": "For I say, through the grace which has been given to me, to every one that is among you, not to have high thoughts above what he should think; but to think so as to be wise, as God has dealt to each a measure of faith.",
    "Romans 12:4": "For, as in one body we have many members, but all the members have not the same office;",
    "Romans 12:5": "thus we, [being] many, are one body in Christ, and each one members one of the other.",
    "Romans 12:6": "But having different gifts, according to the grace which has been given to us, whether [it be] prophecy, [let us prophesy] according to the proportion of faith;",
    "Romans 12:7": "or service, [let us occupy ourselves] in service; or he that teaches, in teaching;",
    "Romans 12:8": "or he that exhorts, in exhortation; he that gives, in simplicity; he that leads, with diligence; he that shews mercy, with cheerfulness.",
    "Romans 12:9": "Let love be unfeigned; abhorring evil; cleaving to good:",
    "Romans 12:10": "as to brotherly love, kindly affectioned towards one another: as to honour, each taking the lead in paying it to the other:",
    "Romans 12:11": "as to diligent zealousness, not slothful; in spirit fervent; serving the Lord.",
    "Romans 12:12": "As regards hope, rejoicing: as regards tribulation, enduring: as regards prayer, persevering:",
    "Romans 12:13": "distributing to the necessities of the saints; given to hospitality.",
    "Romans 12:14": "Bless them that persecute you; bless, and curse not.",
    "Romans 12:15": "Rejoice with those that rejoice, weep with those that weep.",
    "Romans 12:16": "Have the same respect one for another, not minding high things, but going along with the lowly: be not wise in your own eyes:",
    "Romans 12:17": "recompensing to no one evil for evil: providing things honest before all men:",
    "Romans 12:18": "if possible, as far as depends on you, living in peace with all men;",
    "Romans 12:19": "not avenging yourselves, beloved, but give place to wrath; for it is written, Vengeance [belongs] to me, I will recompense, saith the Lord.",
    "Romans 12:20": "If therefore thine enemy should hunger, feed him; if he should thirst, give him drink; for, so doing, thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.",
    "Romans 12:21": "Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.",
    "Romans 13:1": "Let every soul be subject to the authorities that are above [him]. For there is no authority except from God; and those that exist are set up by God.",
    "Romans 13:2": "So that he that sets himself in opposition to the authority resists the ordinance of God; and they who [thus] resist shall bring sentence of guilt on themselves.",
    "Romans 13:3": "For rulers are not a terror to a good work, but to an evil [one]. Dost thou desire then not to be afraid of the authority? practise [what is] good, and thou shalt have praise from it;",
    "Romans 13:4": "for it is God’s minister to thee for good. But if thou practisest evil, fear; for it bears not the sword in vain; for it is God’s minister, an avenger for wrath to him that does evil.",
    "Romans 13:5": "Wherefore it is necessary to be subject, not only on account of wrath, but also on account of conscience.",
    "Romans 13:6": "For on this account ye pay tribute also; for they are God’s officers, attending continually on this very thing.",
    "Romans 13:7": "Render to all their dues: to whom tribute [is due], tribute; to whom custom, custom; to whom fear, fear; to whom honour, honour.",
    "Romans 13:8": "Owe no one anything, unless to love one another: for he that loves another has fulfilled the law.",
    "Romans 13:9": "For, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not lust; and if there be any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.",
    "Romans 13:10": "Love works no ill to its neighbour; love therefore [is the] whole law.",
    "Romans 13:11": "This also, knowing the time, that it is already time that we should be aroused out of sleep; for now [is] our salvation nearer than when we believed.",
    "Romans 13:12": "The night is far spent, and the day is near; let us cast away therefore the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.",
    "Romans 13:13": "As in the day, let us walk becomingly; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and lasciviousness, not in strife and emulation.",
    "Romans 13:14": "But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not take forethought for the flesh to [fulfil its] lusts.",
    "Romans 14:1": "Now him that is weak in the faith receive, not to [the] determining of questions of reasoning.",
    "Romans 14:2": "One man is assured that he may eat all things; but the weak eats herbs.",
    "Romans 14:3": "Let not him that eats make little of him that eats not; and let not him that eats not judge him that eats: for God has received him.",
    "Romans 14:4": "Who art thou that judgest the servant of another? to his own master he stands or falls. And he shall be made to stand; for the Lord is able to make him stand.",
    "Romans 14:5": "One man esteems day more than day; another esteems every day [alike]. Let each be fully persuaded in his own mind.",
    "Romans 14:6": "He that regards the day, regards it to [the] Lord. And he that eats, eats to [the] Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he that does not eat, [it is] to [the] Lord he does not eat, and gives God thanks.",
    "Romans 14:7": "For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself.",
    "Romans 14:8": "For both if we should live, [it is] to the Lord we live; and if we should die, [it is] to the Lord we die: both if we should live then, and if we should die, we are the Lord’s.",
    "Romans 14:9": "For to this [end] Christ has died and lived [again], that he might rule over both dead and living.",
    "Romans 14:10": "But thou, why judgest thou thy brother? or again, thou, why dost thou make little of thy brother? for we shall all be placed before the judgment-seat of God.",
    "Romans 14:11": "For it is written, I live, saith [the] Lord, that to me shall bow every knee, and every tongue shall confess to God.",
    "Romans 14:12": "So then each of us shall give an account concerning himself to God.",
    "Romans 14:13": "Let us no longer therefore judge one another; but judge ye this rather, not to put a stumbling-block or a fall-trap before his brother.",
    "Romans 14:14": "I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself; except to him who reckons anything to be unclean, to that man [it is] unclean.",
    "Romans 14:15": "For if on account of meat thy brother is grieved, thou walkest no longer according to love. Destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ has died.",
    "Romans 14:16": "Let not then your good be evil spoken of;",
    "Romans 14:17": "for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in [the] Holy Spirit.",
    "Romans 14:18": "For he that in this serves the Christ [is] acceptable to God and approved of men.",
    "Romans 14:19": "So then let us pursue the things which tend to peace, and things whereby one shall build up another.",
    "Romans 14:20": "For the sake of meat do not destroy the work of God. All things indeed [are] pure; but [it is] evil to that man who eats while stumbling [in doing so].",
    "Romans 14:21": "[It is] right not to eat meat, nor drink wine, nor [do anything] in which thy brother stumbles, or is offended, or is weak.",
    "Romans 14:22": "Hast thou faith? have [it] to thyself before God. Blessed [is] he who does not judge himself in what he allows.",
    "Romans 14:23": "But he that doubts, if he eat, is condemned; because [it is] not of faith; but whatever [is] not of faith is sin.",
    "Romans 15:1": "But we ought, we that are strong, to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.",
    "Romans 15:2": "Let each one of us please his neighbour with a view to what is good, to edification.",
    "Romans 15:3": "For the Christ also did not please himself; but according as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproach thee have fallen upon me.",
    "Romans 15:4": "For as many things as have been written before have been written for our instruction, that through endurance and through encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope.",
    "Romans 15:5": "Now the God of endurance and of encouragement give to you to be like-minded one toward another, according to Christ Jesus;",
    "Romans 15:6": "that ye may with one accord, with one mouth, glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "Romans 15:7": "Wherefore receive ye one another, according as the Christ also has received you to [the] glory of God.",
    "Romans 15:8": "For I say that Jesus Christ became a minister of [the] circumcision for [the] truth of God, to confirm the promises of the fathers;",
    "Romans 15:9": "and that the nations should glorify God for mercy; according as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among [the] nations, and will sing to thy name.",
    "Romans 15:10": "And again he says, Rejoice, nations, with his people.",
    "Romans 15:11": "And again, Praise the Lord, all [ye] nations, and let all the peoples laud him.",
    "Romans 15:12": "And again, Esaias says, There shall be the root of Jesse, and one that arises, to rule over [the] nations: in him shall [the] nations hope.",
    "Romans 15:13": "Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that ye should abound in hope by [the] power of [the] Holy Spirit.",
    "Romans 15:14": "But I am persuaded, my brethren, I myself also, concerning you, that yourselves also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.",
    "Romans 15:15": "But I have written to you the more boldly, [brethren,] in part, as putting you in mind, because of the grace given to me by God,",
    "Romans 15:16": "for me to be minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, carrying on as a sacrificial service the [message of] glad tidings of God, in order that the offering up of the nations might be acceptable, sanctified by [the] Holy Spirit.",
    "Romans 15:17": "I have therefore [whereof to] boast in Christ Jesus in the things which pertain to God.",
    "Romans 15:18": "For I will not dare to speak anything of the things which Christ has not wrought by me, for [the] obedience of [the] nations, by word and deed,",
    "Romans 15:19": "in [the] power of signs and wonders, in [the] power of [the] Spirit of God; so that I, from Jerusalem, and in a circuit round to Illyricum, have fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ;",
    "Romans 15:20": "and so aiming to announce the glad tidings, not where Christ has been named, that I might not build upon another’s foundation;",
    "Romans 15:21": "but according as it is written, To whom there was nothing told concerning him, they shall see; and they that have not heard shall understand.",
    "Romans 15:22": "Wherefore also I have been often hindered from coming to you.",
    "Romans 15:23": "But now, having no longer place in these regions, and having great desire to come to you these many years,",
    "Romans 15:24": "whenever I should go to Spain; (for I hope to see you as I go through, and by you to be set forward thither, if first I shall have been in part filled with your company;)",
    "Romans 15:25": "but now I go to Jerusalem, ministering to the saints;",
    "Romans 15:26": "for Macedonia and Achaia have been well pleased to make a certain contribution for the poor of the saints who [are] in Jerusalem.",
    "Romans 15:27": "They have been well pleased indeed, and they are their debtors; for if the nations have participated in their spiritual things, they ought also in fleshly to minister to them.",
    "Romans 15:28": "Having finished this therefore, and having sealed to them this fruit, I will set off by you into Spain.",
    "Romans 15:29": "But I know that, coming to you, I shall come in [the] fulness of [the] blessing of Christ.",
    "Romans 15:30": "But I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in prayers for me to God;",
    "Romans 15:31": "that I may be saved from those that do not believe in Judaea; and that my ministry which [I have] for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;",
    "Romans 15:32": "in order that I may come to you in joy by God’s will, and that I may be refreshed with you.",
    "Romans 15:33": "And the God of peace be with you all. Amen.",
    "Romans 16:1": "But I commend to you Phoebe, our sister, who is minister of the assembly which is in Cenchrea;",
    "Romans 16:2": "that ye may receive her in [the] Lord worthily of saints, and that ye may assist her in whatever matter she has need of you; for she also has been a helper of many, and of myself.",
    "Romans 16:3": "Salute Prisca and Aquila, my fellow-workmen in Christ Jesus,",
    "Romans 16:4": "(who for my life staked their own neck; to whom not I only am thankful, but also all the assemblies of the nations,)",
    "Romans 16:5": "and the assembly at their house. Salute Epaenetus, my beloved, who is [the] first-fruits of Asia for Christ.",
    "Romans 16:6": "Salute Maria, who laboured much for you.",
    "Romans 16:7": "Salute Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen and fellow-captives, who are of note among the apostles; who were also in Christ before me.",
    "Romans 16:8": "Salute Amplias, my beloved in the Lord.",
    "Romans 16:9": "Salute Urbanus, our fellow-workman in Christ, and Stachys, my beloved.",
    "Romans 16:10": "Salute Apelles, approved in Christ. Salute those who belong to Aristobulus.",
    "Romans 16:11": "Salute Herodion, my kinsman. Salute those who belong to Narcissus, who are in [the] Lord.",

    "Romans 16:14": "Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brethren with them.",
    "Romans 16:15": "Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints with them.",
    "Romans 16:16": "Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the assemblies of Christ salute you.",
    "Romans 16:17": "But I beseech you, brethren, to consider those who create divisions and occasions of falling, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learnt, and turn away from them.",
    "Romans 16:18": "For such serve not our Lord Christ, but their own belly, and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting.",
    "Romans 16:19": "For your obedience has reached to all. I rejoice therefore as it regards you; but I wish you to be wise [as] to that which is good, and simple [as] to evil.",
    "Romans 16:20": "But the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you.",
    "Romans 16:21": "Timotheus, my fellow-workman, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.",
    "Romans 16:22": "I Tertius, who have written this epistle, salute you in [the] Lord.",
    "Romans 16:23": "Gaius, my host and of the whole assembly, salutes you. Erastus, the steward of the city, salutes you, and the brother Quartus.",
    "Romans 16:24": "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all. Amen.",
    "Romans 16:25": "Now to him that is able to establish you, according to my glad tidings and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to [the] revelation of [the] mystery, as to which silence has been kept in [the] times of the ages,",
    "Romans 16:26": "but [which] has now been made manifest, and by prophetic scriptures, according to commandment of the eternal God, made known for obedience of faith to all the nations—",
    "Romans 16:27": "[the] only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever. Amen.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:1": "Paul, [a] called apostle of Jesus Christ, by God’s will, and Sosthenes the brother,",
    "1 Corinthians 1:2": "to the assembly of God which is in Corinth, to [those] sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours:",
    "1 Corinthians 1:3": "Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:4": "I thank my God always about you, in respect of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus;",
    "1 Corinthians 1:5": "that in everything ye have been enriched in him, in all word [of doctrine], and all knowledge,",
    "1 Corinthians 1:6": "(according as the testimony of the Christ has been confirmed in you,)",
    "1 Corinthians 1:7": "so that ye come short in no gift, awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;",
    "1 Corinthians 1:8": "who shall also confirm you to [the] end, unimpeachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:9": "God [is] faithful, by whom ye have been called into [the] fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:10": "Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all say the same thing, and that there be not among you divisions; but that ye be perfectly united in the same mind and in the same opinion.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:11": "For it has been shewn to me concerning you, my brethren, by those of [the house of] Chloe, that there are strifes among you.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:12": "But I speak of this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:13": "Is the Christ divided? has Paul been crucified for you? or have ye been baptised unto the name of Paul?",
    "1 Corinthians 1:14": "I thank God that I have baptised none of you, unless Crispus and Gaius,",
    "1 Corinthians 1:15": "that no one may say that I have baptised unto my own name.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:16": "Yes, I baptised also the house of Stephanas; for the rest I know not if I have baptised any other.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:17": "For Christ has not sent me to baptise, but to preach glad tidings; not in wisdom of word, that the cross of the Christ may not be made vain.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:18": "For the word of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but to us that are saved it is God’s power.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:19": "For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and set aside the understanding of the understanding ones.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:20": "Where [is the] wise? where scribe? where disputer of this world? has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?",
    "1 Corinthians 1:21": "For since, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom has not known God, God has been pleased by the foolishness of the preaching to save those that believe.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:22": "Since Jews indeed ask for signs, and Greeks seek wisdom;",
    "1 Corinthians 1:23": "but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews an offence, and to nations foolishness;",
    "1 Corinthians 1:24": "but to those that [are] called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ God’s power and God’s wisdom.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:25": "Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:26": "For consider your calling, brethren, that [there are] not many wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many high-born.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:27": "But God has chosen the foolish things of the world, that he may put to shame the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world, that he may put to shame the strong things;",
    "1 Corinthians 1:28": "and the ignoble things of the world, and the despised, has God chosen, [and] things that are not, that he may annul the things that are;",
    "1 Corinthians 1:29": "so that no flesh should boast before God.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:30": "But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who has been made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and holiness, and redemption;",
    "1 Corinthians 1:31": "that according as it is written, He that boasts, let him boast in [the] Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:1": "And I, when I came to you, brethren, came not in excellency of word, or wisdom, announcing to you the testimony of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:2": "For I did not judge [it well] to know anything among you save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:3": "And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling;",
    "1 Corinthians 2:4": "and my word and my preaching, not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of [the] Spirit and of power;",
    "1 Corinthians 2:5": "that your faith might not stand in men’s wisdom, but in God’s power.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:6": "But we speak wisdom among the perfect; but wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, who come to nought.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:7": "But we speak God’s wisdom in [a] mystery, that hidden [wisdom] which God had predetermined before the ages for our glory:",
    "1 Corinthians 2:8": "which none of the princes of this age knew, (for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory;)",
    "1 Corinthians 2:9": "but according as it is written, Things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man’s heart, which God has prepared for them that love him,",
    "1 Corinthians 2:10": "but God has revealed to us by [his] Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:11": "For who of men hath known the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? thus also the things of God knows no one except the Spirit of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:12": "But we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which [is] of God, that we may know the things which have been freely given to us of God:",
    "1 Corinthians 2:13": "which also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, communicating spiritual [things] by spiritual [means].",
    "1 Corinthians 2:14": "But [the] natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him; and he cannot know [them] because they are spiritually discerned;",
    "1 Corinthians 2:15": "but the spiritual discerns all things, and he is discerned of no one.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:16": "For who has known the mind of [the] Lord, who shall instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:1": "And I, brethren, have not been able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly; as to babes in Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:2": "I have given you milk to drink, not meat, for ye have not yet been able, nor indeed are ye yet able;",
    "1 Corinthians 3:3": "for ye are yet carnal. For whereas [there are] among you emulation and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk according to man?",
    "1 Corinthians 3:4": "For when one says, I am of Paul, and another, I of Apollos, are ye not men?",
    "1 Corinthians 3:5": "Who then is Apollos, and who Paul? Ministering servants, through whom ye have believed, and as the Lord has given to each.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:6": "I have planted; Apollos watered; but God has given the increase.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:7": "So that neither the planter is anything, nor the waterer; but God the giver of the increase.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:8": "But the planter and the waterer are one; but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:9": "For we are God’s fellow-workmen; ye are God’s husbandry, God’s building.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:10": "According to the grace of God which has been given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation, but another builds upon it. But let each see how he builds upon it.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:11": "For other foundation can no man lay besides that which [is] laid, which is Jesus Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:12": "Now if any one build upon [this] foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, straw,",
    "1 Corinthians 3:13": "the work of each shall be made manifest; for the day shall declare [it], because it is revealed in fire; and the fire shall try the work of each what it is.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:14": "If the work of any one which he has built upon [the foundation] shall abide, he shall receive a reward.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:15": "If the work of any one shall be consumed, he shall suffer loss, but he shall be saved, but so as through [the] fire.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:16": "Do ye not know that ye are [the] temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwells in you?",
    "1 Corinthians 3:17": "If any one corrupt the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:18": "Let no one deceive himself: if any one thinks himself to be wise among you in this world, let him become foolish, that he may be wise.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:19": "For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is written, He who takes the wise in their craftiness.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:20": "And again, [The] Lord knows the reasonings of the wise that they are vain.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:21": "So that let no one boast in men; for all things are yours.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:22": "Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or [the] world, or life, or death, or things present, or things coming, all are yours;",
    "1 Corinthians 3:23": "and ye [are] Christ’s, and Christ [is] God’s.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:1": "Let a man so account of us as servants of Christ, and stewards of [the] mysteries of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:2": "Here, further, it is sought in stewards, that a man be found faithful.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:3": "But for me it is the very smallest matter that I be examined of you or of man’s day. Nor do I even examine myself.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:4": "For I am conscious of nothing in myself; but I am not justified by this: but he that examines me is the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:5": "So that do not judge anything before [the] time, until the Lord shall come, who shall also both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and shall make manifest the counsels of hearts; and then shall each have [his] praise from God.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:6": "Now these things, brethren, I have transferred, in their application, to myself and Apollos, for your sakes, that ye may learn in us the [lesson of] not [letting your thoughts go] above what is written, that ye may not be puffed up one for [such a] one against another.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:7": "For who makes thee to differ? and what hast thou which thou hast not received? but if also thou hast received, why boastest thou as not receiving?",
    "1 Corinthians 4:8": "Already ye are filled; already ye have been enriched; ye have reigned without us; and I would that ye reigned, that we also might reign with you.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:9": "For I think that God has set us the apostles for the last, as appointed to death. For we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:10": "We [are] fools for Christ’s sake, but ye prudent in Christ: we weak, but ye strong: ye glorious, but we in dishonour.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:11": "To the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are in nakedness, and buffeted, and wander without a home,",
    "1 Corinthians 4:12": "and labour, working with our own hands. Railed at, we bless; persecuted, we suffer [it];",
    "1 Corinthians 4:13": "insulted, we entreat: we are become as [the] offscouring of the world, [the] refuse of all, until now.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:14": "Not [as] chiding do I write these things to you, but as my beloved children I admonish [you].",
    "1 Corinthians 4:15": "For if ye should have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the glad tidings.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:16": "I entreat you therefore, be my imitators.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:17": "For this reason I have sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved and faithful child in [the] Lord, who shall put you in mind of my ways [as] they [are] in Christ, according as I teach everywhere in every assembly.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:18": "But some have been puffed up, as if I were not coming to you;",
    "1 Corinthians 4:19": "but I will come quickly to you, if the Lord will; and I will know, not the word of those that are puffed up, but the power.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:20": "For the kingdom of God [is] not in word, but in power.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:21": "What will ye? that I come to you with a rod; or in love, and [in] a spirit of meekness?",
    "1 Corinthians 5:1": "It is universally reported [that there is] fornication among you, and such fornication as [is] not even among the nations, so that one should have his father’s wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:2": "And ye are puffed up, and ye have not rather mourned, in order that he that has done this deed might be taken away out of the midst of you.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:3": "For I, [as] absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged as present,",
    "1 Corinthians 5:4": "[to deliver,] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ (ye and my spirit being gathered together, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ), him that has so wrought this:",
    "1 Corinthians 5:5": "to deliver him, [I say,] [being] such, to Satan for destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:6": "Your boasting [is] not good. Do ye not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?",
    "1 Corinthians 5:7": "Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, according as ye are unleavened. For also our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed;",
    "1 Corinthians 5:8": "so that let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and wickedness, but with unleavened [bread] of sincerity and truth.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:9": "I have written to you in the epistle not to mix with fornicators;",
    "1 Corinthians 5:10": "not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the avaricious and rapacious, or idolaters, since [then] ye should go out of the world.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:11": "But now I have written to you, if any one called brother be fornicator, or avaricious, or idolater, or abusive, or a drunkard, or rapacious, not to mix with [him]; with such a one not even to eat.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:12": "For what have I [to do] with judging those outside also? ye, do not ye judge them that are within?",
    "1 Corinthians 5:13": "But those without God judges. Remove the wicked person from amongst yourselves.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:1": "Dare any one of you, having a matter against another, prosecute his suit before the unjust, and not before the saints?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:2": "Do ye not then know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world is judged by you, are ye unworthy of [the] smallest judgments?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:3": "Do ye not know that we shall judge angels? and not then matters of this life?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:4": "If then ye have judgments as to things of this life, set those [to judge] who are little esteemed in the assembly.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:5": "I speak to you [to put you] to shame. Thus there is not a wise person among you, not even one, who shall be able to decide between his brethren!",
    "1 Corinthians 6:6": "But brother prosecutes his suit with brother, and that before unbelievers.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:7": "Already indeed then it is altogether a fault in you that ye have suits between yourselves. Why do ye not rather suffer wrong? why are ye not rather defrauded?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:8": "But ye do wrong, and defraud, and this [your] brethren.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:9": "Do ye not know that unrighteous [persons] shall not inherit [the] kingdom of God? Do not err: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor those who make women of themselves, nor who abuse themselves with men,",
    "1 Corinthians 6:10": "nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor abusive persons, nor [the] rapacious, shall inherit [the] kingdom of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:11": "And these things were some of you; but ye have been washed, but ye have been sanctified, but ye have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:12": "All things are lawful to me, but all things do not profit; all things are lawful to me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:13": "Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats; but God will bring to nothing both it and them: but the body [is] not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:14": "And God has both raised up the Lord, and will raise us up from among [the dead] by his power.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:15": "Do ye not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then, taking the members of the Christ, make [them] members of a harlot? Far be the thought.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:16": "Do ye not know that he [that is] joined to the harlot is one body? for the two, he says, shall be one flesh.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:17": "But he that [is] joined to the Lord is one Spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:18": "Flee fornication. Every sin which a man may practise is without the body, but he that commits fornication sins against his own body.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:19": "Do ye not know that your body is [the] temple of the Holy Spirit which [is] in you, which ye have of God; and ye are not your own?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:20": "for ye have been bought with a price: glorify now then God in your body.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:1": "But concerning the things of which ye have written [to me]: [It is] good for a man not to touch a woman;",
    "1 Corinthians 7:2": "but on account of fornications, let each have his own wife, and each [woman] have her own husband.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:3": "Let the husband render her due to the wife, and in like manner the wife to the husband.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:4": "The wife has not authority over her own body, but the husband: in like manner also the husband has not authority over his own body, but the wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:5": "Defraud not one another, unless, it may be, by consent for a time, that ye may devote yourselves to prayer, and again be together, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:6": "But this I say, as consenting [to], not as commanding [it].",
    "1 Corinthians 7:7": "Now I wish all men to be even as myself: but every one has his own gift of God: one man thus, and another thus.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:8": "But I say to the unmarried and to the widows, It is good for them that they remain even as I.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:9": "But if they have not control over themselves, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:10": "But to the married I enjoin, not I, but the Lord, Let not wife be separated from husband;",
    "1 Corinthians 7:11": "(but if also she shall have been separated, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband;) and let not husband leave wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:12": "But as to the rest, I say, not the Lord, If any brother have an unbelieving wife, and she consent to dwell with him, let him not leave her.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:13": "And a woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he consents to dwell with her, let her not leave [her] husband.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:14": "For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother; since [otherwise] indeed your children are unclean, but now they are holy.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:15": "But if the unbeliever go away, let them go away; a brother or a sister is not bound in such [cases], but God has called us in peace.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:16": "For what knowest thou, O wife, if thou shalt save thy husband? or what knowest thou, O husband, if thou shalt save thy wife?",
    "1 Corinthians 7:17": "However, as the Lord has divided to each, as God has called each, so let him walk; and thus I ordain in all the assemblies.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:18": "Has any one been called circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised: has any one been called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:19": "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but keeping God’s commandments.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:20": "Let each abide in that calling in which he has been called.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:21": "Hast thou been called [being] a bondman, let it not concern thee; but and if thou canst become free, use [it] rather.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:22": "For the bondman that is called in [the] Lord is the Lord’s freedman; in like manner [also] the freeman being called is Christ’s bondman.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:23": "Ye have been bought with a price; do not be the bondmen of men.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:24": "Let each, wherein he is called, brethren, therein abide with God.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:25": "But concerning virgins, I have no commandment of [the] Lord; but I give my opinion, as having received mercy of [the] Lord to be faithful.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:26": "I think then that this is good, on account of the present necessity, that [it is] good for a man to remain so as he is.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:27": "Art thou bound to a wife? seek not to be loosed; art thou free from a wife? do not seek a wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:28": "But if thou shouldest also marry, thou hast not sinned; and if the virgin marry, they have not sinned: but such shall have tribulation in the flesh; but I spare you.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:29": "But this I say, brethren, the time is straitened. For the rest, that they who have wives, be as not having [any]:",
    "1 Corinthians 7:30": "and they that weep, as not weeping; and they that rejoice, as not rejoicing; and they that buy, as not possessing;",
    "1 Corinthians 7:31": "and they that use the world, as not disposing of it as their own; for the fashion of this world passes.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:32": "But I wish you to be without care. The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, how he shall please the Lord;",
    "1 Corinthians 7:33": "but he that has married cares for the things of the world, how he shall please his wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:34": "There is a difference between the wife and the virgin. The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but she that has married cares for the things of the world, how she shall please her husband.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:35": "But I say this for your own profit; not that I may set a snare before you, but for what [is] seemly, and waiting on the Lord without distraction.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:36": "But if any one think that he behaves unseemly to his virginity, if he be beyond the flower of his age, and so it must be, let him do what he will, he does not sin: let them marry.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:37": "But he who stands firm in his heart, having no need, but has authority over his own will, and has judged this in his heart to keep his own virginity, he does well.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:38": "So that he that marries himself does well; and he that does not marry does better.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:39": "A wife is bound for whatever time her husband lives; but if the husband be fallen asleep, she is free to be married to whom she will, only in [the] Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:40": "But she is happier if she so remain, according to my judgment; but I think that I also have God’s Spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:1": "But concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know, (for we all have knowledge: knowledge puffs up, but love edifies.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:2": "If any one think he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know [it].",
    "1 Corinthians 8:3": "But if any one love God, he is known of him):",
    "1 Corinthians 8:4": "—concerning then the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol [is] nothing in [the] world, and that there [is] no other God save one.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:5": "For and if indeed there are [those] called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, (as there are gods many, and lords many,)",
    "1 Corinthians 8:6": "yet to us [there is] one God, the Father, of whom all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom [are] all things, and we by him.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:7": "But knowledge [is] not in all: but some, with conscience of the idol, until now eat as of a thing sacrificed to idols; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:8": "But meat does not commend us to God; neither if we should not eat do we come short; nor if we should eat have we an advantage.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:9": "But see lest anywise this your right [to eat] itself be a stumbling-block to the weak.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:10": "For if any one see thee, who hast knowledge, sitting at table in an idol-house, shall not his conscience, he being weak, be emboldened to eat the things sacrificed to the idol?",
    "1 Corinthians 8:11": "and the weak [one], the brother for whose sake Christ died, will perish through thy knowledge.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:12": "Now, thus sinning against the brethren, and wounding their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:13": "Wherefore if meat be a fall-trap to my brother, I will eat no flesh for ever, that I may not be a fall-trap to my brother.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:1": "Am I not free? am I not an apostle? have I not seen Jesus our Lord? are not ye my work in [the] Lord?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:2": "If I am not an apostle to others, yet at any rate I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in [the] Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:3": "My defence to those who examine me is this:",
    "1 Corinthians 9:4": "Have we not a right to eat and to drink?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:5": "have we not a right to take round a sister [as] wife, as also the other apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:6": "Or I alone and Barnabas, have we not a right not to work?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:7": "Who ever carries on war at his own charges? who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? or who herds a flock and does not eat of the milk of the flock?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:8": "Do I speak these things as a man, or does not the law also say these things?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:9": "For in the law of Moses it is written, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that is treading out corn. Is God occupied about the oxen,",
    "1 Corinthians 9:10": "or does he say [it] altogether for our sakes? For for our sakes it has been written, that the plougher should plough in hope, and he that treads out corn, in hope of partaking of [it].",
    "1 Corinthians 9:11": "If we have sown to you spiritual things, [is it a] great [thing] if we shall reap your carnal things?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:12": "If others partake of this right over you, should not rather we? But we have not used this right, but we bear all things, that we may put no hindrance in the way of the glad tidings of the Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:13": "Do ye not know that they who labour [at] sacred things eat of the [offerings offered in the] temple; they that attend at the altar partake with the altar?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:14": "So also the Lord has ordained to those that announce the glad tidings to live of the glad tidings.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:15": "But I have used none of these things. Now I have not written these things that it should be thus in my case; for [it were] good for me rather to die than that any one should make vain my boast.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:16": "For if I announce the glad tidings, I have nothing to boast of; for a necessity is laid upon me; for it is woe to me if I should not announce the glad tidings.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:17": "For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with an administration.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:18": "What is the reward then that I have? That in announcing the glad tidings I make the glad tidings costless [to others], so as not to have made use, as belonging to me, of my right in [announcing] the glad tidings.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:19": "For being free from all, I have made myself bondman to all, that I might gain the most [possible].",
    "1 Corinthians 9:20": "And I became to the Jews as a Jew, in order that I might gain the Jews: to those under law, as under law, not being myself under law, in order that I might gain those under law:",
    "1 Corinthians 9:21": "to those without law, as without law, (not as without law to God, but as legitimately subject to Christ,) in order that I might gain [those] without law.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:22": "I became to the weak, [as] weak, in order that I might gain the weak. To all I have become all things, in order that at all events I might save some.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:23": "And I do all things for the sake of the glad tidings, that I may be fellow-partaker with them.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:24": "Know ye not that they who run in [the] race-course run all, but one receives the prize? Thus run in order that ye may obtain.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:25": "But every one that contends [for a prize] is temperate in all things: they then indeed that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:26": "I therefore thus run, as not uncertainly; so I combat, as not beating the air.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:27": "But I buffet my body, and lead it captive, lest [after] having preached to others I should be myself rejected.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:1": "For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;",
    "1 Corinthians 10:2": "and all were baptised unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;",
    "1 Corinthians 10:3": "and all ate the same spiritual food,",
    "1 Corinthians 10:4": "and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed [them]: (now the rock was the Christ;)",
    "1 Corinthians 10:5": "yet God was not pleased with the most of them, for they were strewed in the desert.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:6": "But these things happened [as] types of us, that we should not be lusters after evil things, as they also lusted.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:7": "Neither be ye idolaters, as some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:8": "Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:9": "Neither let us tempt the Christ, as some of them tempted, and perished by serpents.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:10": "Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:11": "Now all these things happened to them [as] types, and have been written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:12": "So that let him that thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:13": "No temptation has taken you but such as is according to man’s nature; and God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able [to bear], but will with the temptation make the issue also, so that [ye] should be able to bear [it].",
    "1 Corinthians 10:14": "Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:15": "I speak as to intelligent [persons]: do ye judge what I say.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:16": "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not [the] communion of the blood of the Christ? The bread which we break, is it not [the] communion of the body of the Christ?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:17": "Because we, [being] many, are one loaf, one body; for we all partake of that one loaf.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:18": "See Israel according to flesh: are not they who eat the sacrifices in communion with the altar?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:19": "What then do I say? that what is sacrificed to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:20": "But that what [the nations] sacrifice they sacrifice to demons, and not to God. Now I do not wish you to be in communion with demons.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:21": "Ye cannot drink [the] Lord’s cup, and [the] cup of demons: ye cannot partake of [the] Lord’s table, and of [the] table of demons.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:22": "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:23": "All things are lawful, but all are not profitable; all things are lawful, but all do not edify.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:24": "Let no one seek his own [advantage], but that of the other.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:25": "Everything sold in the shambles eat, making no inquiry for conscience sake.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:26": "For the earth [is] the Lord’s and its fulness.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:27": "But if any one of the unbelievers invite you, and ye are minded to go, all that is set before you eat, making no inquiry for conscience sake.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:28": "But if any one say to you, This is offered to holy purposes, do not eat, for his sake that pointed it out, and conscience sake;",
    "1 Corinthians 10:29": "but conscience, I mean, not thine own, but that of the other: for why is my liberty judged by another conscience?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:30": "If I partake with thanksgiving, why am I spoken evil of for what I give thanks for?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:31": "Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatever ye do, do all things to God’s glory.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:32": "Give no occasion to stumbling, whether to Jews, or Greeks, or the assembly of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:33": "Even as I also please all in all things; not seeking my own profit, but that of the many, that they may be saved.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:1": "Be my imitators, even as I also [am] of Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:2": "Now I praise you, that in all things ye are mindful of me; and that as I have directed you, ye keep the directions.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:3": "But I wish you to know that the Christ is the head of every man, but woman’s head [is] the man, and the Christ’s head God.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:4": "Every man praying or prophesying, having [anything] on his head, puts his head to shame.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:5": "But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered puts her own head to shame; for it is one and the same as a shaved [woman].",
    "1 Corinthians 11:6": "For if a woman be not covered, let her hair also be cut off. But if [it be] shameful to a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved, let her be covered.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:7": "For man indeed ought not to have his head covered, being God’s image and glory; but woman is man’s glory.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:8": "For man is not of woman, but woman of man.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:9": "For also man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:10": "Therefore ought the woman to have authority on her head, on account of the angels.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:11": "However, neither [is] woman without man, nor man without woman, in [the] Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:12": "For as the woman [is] of the man, so also [is] the man by the woman, but all things of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:13": "Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman should pray to God uncovered?",
    "1 Corinthians 11:14": "Does not even nature itself teach you, that man, if he have long hair, it is a dishonour to him?",
    "1 Corinthians 11:15": "But woman, if she have long hair, [it is] glory to her; for the long hair is given [to her] in lieu of a veil.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:16": "But if any one think to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the assemblies of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:17": "But [in] prescribing [to you on] this [which I now enter on], I do not praise, [namely,] that ye come together, not for the better, but for the worse.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:18": "For first, when ye come together in assembly, I hear there exist divisions among you, and I partly give credit [to it].",
    "1 Corinthians 11:19": "For there must also be sects among you, that the approved may become manifest among you.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:20": "When ye come therefore together into one place, it is not to eat [the] Lord’s supper.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:21": "For each one in eating takes his own supper before [others], and one is hungry and another drinks to excess.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:22": "Have ye not then houses for eating and drinking? or do ye despise the assembly of God, and put to shame them who have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this [point] I do not praise.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:23": "For I received from the Lord, that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread,",
    "1 Corinthians 11:24": "and having given thanks broke [it], and said, This is my body, which [is] for you: this do in remembrance of me.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:25": "In like manner also the cup, after having supped, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye shall drink [it], in remembrance of me.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:26": "For as often as ye shall eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye announce the death of the Lord, until he come.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:27": "So that whosoever shall eat the bread, or drink the cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty in respect of the body and of the blood of the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:28": "But let a man prove himself, and thus eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:29": "For [the] eater and drinker eats and drinks judgment to himself, not distinguishing the body.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:30": "On this account many among you [are] weak and infirm, and a good many are fallen asleep.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:31": "But if we judged ourselves, so were we not judged.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:32": "But being judged, we are disciplined of [the] Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:33": "So that, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait for one another.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:34": "If any one be hungry, let him eat at home, that ye may not come together for judgment. But the other things, whenever I come, I will set in order.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:1": "But concerning spiritual [manifestations], brethren, I do not wish you to be ignorant.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:2": "Ye know that when ye were [of the] nations [ye were] led away to dumb idols, in whatever way ye might be led.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:3": "I give you therefore to know, that no one, speaking in [the power of the] Spirit of God, says, Curse [on] Jesus; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in [the power of the] Holy Spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:4": "But there are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit;",
    "1 Corinthians 12:5": "and there are distinctions of services, and the same Lord;",
    "1 Corinthians 12:6": "and there are distinctions of operations, but the same God who operates all things in all.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:7": "But to each the manifestation of the Spirit is given for profit.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:8": "For to one, by the Spirit, is given [the] word of wisdom; and to another [the] word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;",
    "1 Corinthians 12:9": "and to a different one faith, in [the power of] the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healing in [the power of] the same Spirit;",
    "1 Corinthians 12:10": "and to another operations of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; and to a different one kinds of tongues; and to another interpretation of tongues.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:11": "But all these things operates the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each in particular according as he pleases.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:12": "For even as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also [is] the Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:13": "For also in [the power of] one Spirit we have all been baptised into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bondmen or free, and have all been given to drink of one Spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:14": "For also the body is not one member but many.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:15": "If the foot say, Because I am not a hand I am not of the body, is it on account of this not indeed of the body?",
    "1 Corinthians 12:16": "And if the ear say, Because I am not an eye I am not of the body, is it on account of this not indeed of the body?",
    "1 Corinthians 12:17": "If the whole body [were] an eye, where the hearing? if all hearing, where the smelling?",
    "1 Corinthians 12:18": "But now God has set the members, each one of them in the body, according as it has pleased [him].",
    "1 Corinthians 12:19": "But if all were one member, where the body?",
    "1 Corinthians 12:20": "But now the members [are] many, and the body one.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:21": "The eye cannot say to the hand, I have not need of thee; or again, the head to the feet, I have not need of you.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:22": "But much rather, the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary;",
    "1 Corinthians 12:23": "and those [parts] of the body which we esteem to be the more void of honour, these we clothe with more abundant honour; and our uncomely [parts] have more abundant comeliness;",
    "1 Corinthians 12:24": "but our comely [parts] have not need. But God has tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to [the part] that lacked;",
    "1 Corinthians 12:25": "that there might be no division in the body, but that the members might have the same concern one for another.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:26": "And if one member suffer, all the members suffer with [it]; and if one member be glorified, all the members rejoice with [it].",
    "1 Corinthians 12:27": "Now ye are Christ’s body, and members in particular.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:28": "And God has set certain in the assembly: first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers; then miraculous powers; then gifts of healings; helps; governments; kinds of tongues.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:29": "[Are] all apostles? [are] all prophets? [are] all teachers? [are] all [in possession of] miraculous powers?",
    "1 Corinthians 12:30": "have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?",
    "1 Corinthians 12:31": "But desire earnestly the greater gifts, and yet shew I unto you a way of more surpassing excellence.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:1": "If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:2": "And if I have prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:3": "And if I shall dole out all my goods in food, and if I deliver up my body that I may be burned, but have not love, I profit nothing.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:4": "Love has long patience, is kind; love is not emulous [of others]; love is not insolent and rash, is not puffed up,",
    "1 Corinthians 13:5": "does not behave in an unseemly manner, does not seek what is its own, is not quickly provoked, does not impute evil,",
    "1 Corinthians 13:6": "does not rejoice at iniquity but rejoices with the truth,",
    "1 Corinthians 13:7": "bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:8": "Love never fails; but whether prophecies, they shall be done away; or tongues, they shall cease; or knowledge, it shall be done away.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:9": "For we know in part, and we prophesy in part:",
    "1 Corinthians 13:10": "but when that which is perfect has come, that which is in part shall be done away.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:11": "When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I reasoned as a child; when I became a man, I had done with what belonged to the child.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:12": "For we see now through a dim window obscurely, but then face to face; now I know partially, but then I shall know according as I also have been known.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:13": "And now abide faith, hope, love; these three things; and the greater of these [is] love.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:1": "Follow after love, and be emulous of spiritual [manifestations], but rather that ye may prophesy.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:2": "For he that speaks with a tongue does not speak to men but to God: for no one hears; but in spirit he speaks mysteries.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:3": "But he that prophesies speaks to men [in] edification, and encouragement, and consolation.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:4": "He that speaks with a tongue edifies himself; but he that prophesies edifies [the] assembly.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:5": "Now I desire that ye should all speak with tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy. But greater is he that prophesies than he that speaks with tongues, unless he interpret, that the assembly may receive edification.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:6": "And now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I shall speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in teaching?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:7": "Even lifeless things giving a sound, whether pipe or harp, if they give not distinction to the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:8": "For also, if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself for war?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:9": "Thus also ye with the tongue, unless ye give a distinct speech, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye will be speaking to the air.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:10": "There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of undistinguishable sound.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:11": "If therefore I do not know the power of the sound, I shall be to him that speaks a barbarian, and he that speaks a barbarian for me.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:12": "Thus ye also, since ye are desirous of spirits, seek that ye may abound for the edification of the assembly.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:13": "Wherefore let him that speaks with a tongue pray that he may interpret.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:14": "For if I pray with a tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:15": "What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, but I will pray also with the understanding; I will sing with the spirit, but I will sing also with the understanding.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:16": "Since otherwise, if thou blessest with [the] spirit, how shall he who fills the place of the simple [Christian] say Amen, at thy giving of thanks, since he does not know what thou sayest?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:17": "For thou indeed givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:18": "I thank God I speak in a tongue more than all of you:",
    "1 Corinthians 14:19": "but in [the] assembly I desire to speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others also, [rather] than ten thousand words in a tongue.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:20": "Brethren, be not children in [your] minds, but in malice be babes; but in [your] minds be grown [men].",
    "1 Corinthians 14:21": "It is written in the law, By people of other tongues, and by strange lips, will I speak to this people; and neither thus will they hear me, saith the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:22": "So that tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to unbelievers; but prophecy, not to unbelievers, but to those who believe.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:23": "If therefore the whole assembly come together in one place, and all speak with tongues, and simple [persons] enter in, or unbelievers, will not they say ye are mad?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:24": "But if all prophesy, and some unbeliever or simple [person] come in, he is convicted of all, he is judged of all;",
    "1 Corinthians 14:25": "the secrets of his heart are manifested; and thus, falling upon [his] face, he will do homage to God, reporting that God is indeed amongst you.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:26": "What is it then, brethren? whenever ye come together, each [of you] has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edification.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:27": "If any one speak with a tongue, [let it be] two, or at the most three, and separately, and let one interpret;",
    "1 Corinthians 14:28": "but if there be no interpreter, let him be silent in [the] assembly, and let him speak to himself and to God.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:29": "And let two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:30": "But if there be a revelation to another sitting [there], let the first be silent.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:31": "For ye can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all be encouraged.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:32": "And spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:33": "For God is not [a God] of disorder but of peace, as in all the assemblies of the saints.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:34": "Let [your] women be silent in the assemblies, for it is not permitted to them to speak; but to be in subjection, as the law also says.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:35": "But if they wish to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is a shame for a woman to speak in assembly.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:36": "Did the word of God go out from you, or did it come to you only?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:37": "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is [the] Lord’s commandment.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:38": "But if any be ignorant, let him be ignorant.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:39": "So that, brethren, desire to prophesy, and do not forbid the speaking with tongues.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:40": "But let all things be done comelily and with order.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:1": "But I make known to you, brethren, the glad tidings which I announced to you, which also ye received, in which also ye stand,",
    "1 Corinthians 15:2": "by which also ye are saved, (if ye hold fast the word which I announced to you as the glad tidings,) unless indeed ye have believed in vain.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:3": "For I delivered to you, in the first place, what also I had received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures;",
    "1 Corinthians 15:4": "and that he was buried; and that he was raised the third day, according to the scriptures;",
    "1 Corinthians 15:5": "and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:6": "Then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the most remain until now, but some also have fallen asleep.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:7": "Then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles;",
    "1 Corinthians 15:8": "and last of all, as to an abortion, he appeared to me also.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:9": "For I am the least of the apostles, who am not fit to be called apostle, because I have persecuted the assembly of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:10": "But by God’s grace I am what I am; and his grace, which [was] towards me, has not been vain; but I have laboured more abundantly than they all, but not I, but the grace of God which [was] with me.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:11": "Whether, therefore, I or they, thus we preach, and thus ye have believed.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:12": "Now if Christ is preached that he is raised from among [the] dead, how say some among you that there is not a resurrection of [those that are] dead?",
    "1 Corinthians 15:13": "But if there is not a resurrection of [those that are] dead, neither is Christ raised:",
    "1 Corinthians 15:14": "but if Christ is not raised, then, indeed, vain also [is] our preaching, and vain also your faith.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:15": "And we are found also false witnesses of God; for we have witnessed concerning God that he raised the Christ, whom he has not raised if indeed [those that are] dead are not raised.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:16": "For if [those that are] dead are not raised, neither is Christ raised;",
    "1 Corinthians 15:17": "but if Christ be not raised, your faith [is] vain; ye are yet in your sins.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:18": "Then indeed also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:19": "If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are [the] most miserable of all men.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:20": "(But now Christ is raised from among [the] dead, first-fruits of those fallen asleep.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:21": "For since by man [came] death, by man also resurrection of [those that are] dead.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:22": "For as in the Adam all die, thus also in the Christ all shall be made alive.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:23": "But each in his own rank: [the] first-fruits, Christ; then those that are the Christ’s at his coming.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:24": "Then the end, when he gives up the kingdom to him [who is] God and Father; when he shall have annulled all rule and all authority and power.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:25": "For he must reign until he put all enemies under his feet.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:26": "[The] last enemy [that] is annulled [is] death.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:27": "For he has put all things in subjection under his feet. But when he says that all things are put in subjection, [it is] evident that [it is] except him who put all things in subjection to him.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:28": "But when all things shall have been brought into subjection to him, then the Son also himself shall be placed in subjection to him who put all things in subjection to him, that God may be all in all.)",
    "1 Corinthians 15:29": "Since what shall the baptised for the dead do if [those that are] dead rise not at all? why also are they baptised for them?",
    "1 Corinthians 15:30": "Why do we also endanger ourselves every hour?",
    "1 Corinthians 15:31": "Daily I die, by your boasting which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:32": "If, [to speak] after the manner of man, I have fought with beasts in Ephesus, what is the profit to me if [those that are] dead do not rise? let us eat and drink; for to-morrow we die.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:33": "Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:34": "Awake up righteously, and sin not; for some are ignorant of God: I speak to you as a matter of shame.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:35": "But some one will say, How are the dead raised? and with what body do they come?",
    "1 Corinthians 15:36": "Fool; what thou sowest is not quickened unless it die.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:37": "And what thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain: it may be of wheat, or some one of the rest:",
    "1 Corinthians 15:38": "and God gives to it a body as he has pleased, and to each of the seeds its own body.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:39": "Every flesh [is] not the same flesh, but one [is] of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another [flesh] of birds, and another of fishes.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:40": "And [there are] heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies: but different is the glory of the heavenly, different that of the earthly:",
    "1 Corinthians 15:41": "one [the] sun’s glory, and another [the] moon’s glory, and another [the] stars’ glory; for star differs from star in glory.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:42": "Thus also [is] the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruptibility.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:43": "It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:44": "It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body: if there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual [one].",
    "1 Corinthians 15:45": "Thus also it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul; the last Adam a quickening spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:46": "But that which is spiritual [was] not first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual:",
    "1 Corinthians 15:47": "the first man out of [the] earth, made of dust; the second man, out of heaven.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:48": "Such as he made of dust, such also those made of dust; and such as the heavenly [one], such also the heavenly [ones].",
    "1 Corinthians 15:49": "And as we have borne the image of the [one] made of dust, we shall bear also the image of the heavenly [one].",
    "1 Corinthians 15:50": "But this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit God’s kingdom, nor does corruption inherit incorruptibility.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:51": "Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all fall asleep, but we shall all be changed,",
    "1 Corinthians 15:52": "in an instant, in [the] twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:53": "For this corruptible must needs put on incorruptibility, and this mortal put on immortality.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:54": "But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruptibility, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the word written: Death has been swallowed up in victory.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:55": "Where, O death, [is] thy sting? where, O death, thy victory?",
    "1 Corinthians 15:56": "Now the sting of death [is] sin, and the power of sin the law;",
    "1 Corinthians 15:57": "but thanks to God, who gives us the victory by our Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:58": "So then, my beloved brethren, be firm, immovable, abounding always in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not in vain in [the] Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:1": "Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the assemblies of Galatia, so do ye do also.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:2": "On [the] first of [the] week let each of you put by at home, laying up [in] whatever [degree] he may have prospered, that there may be no collections when I come.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:3": "And when I am arrived, whomsoever ye shall approve, these I will send with letters to carry your bounty to Jerusalem:",
    "1 Corinthians 16:4": "and if it be suitable that I also should go, they shall go with me.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:5": "But I will come to you when I shall have gone through Macedonia; for I do go through Macedonia.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:6": "But perhaps I will stay with you, or even winter with you, that ye may set me forward wheresoever I may go.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:7": "For I will not see you now in passing, for I hope to remain a certain time with you, if the Lord permit.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:8": "But I remain in Ephesus until Pentecost.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:9": "For a great door is opened to me and an effectual [one], and [the] adversaries many.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:10": "Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear; for he works the work of the Lord, even as I.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:11": "Let not therefore any one despise him; but set him forward in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brethren.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:12": "Now concerning the brother Apollos, I begged him much that he would go to you with the brethren; but it was not at all [his] will to go now; but he will come when he shall have good opportunity.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:13": "Be vigilant; stand fast in the faith; quit yourselves like men; be strong.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:14": "Let all things ye do be done in love.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:15": "But I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first-fruits of Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the saints for service,)",
    "1 Corinthians 16:16": "that ye should also be subject to such, and to every one joined in the work and labouring.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:17": "But I rejoice in the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus; because they have supplied what was lacking on your part.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:18": "For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: own therefore such.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:19": "The assemblies of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla, with the assembly in their house, salute you much in [the] Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:20": "All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:21": "The salutation of [me] Paul with my own hand.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:22": "If any one love not the Lord [Jesus Christ] let him be Anathema Maranatha.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:23": "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:24": "My love [be] with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen."
