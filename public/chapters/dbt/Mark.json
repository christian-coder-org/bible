    "Malachi 1:1": "The burden of the word of Jehovah to Israel by Malachi.",
    "Malachi 1:2": "I have loved you, saith Jehovah; but ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob’s brother? saith Jehovah, and I loved Jacob,",
    "Malachi 1:3": "and I hated Esau; and made his mountains a desolation, and [gave] his inheritance to the jackals of the wilderness.",
    "Malachi 1:4": "If Edom say, We are broken down, but we will build again the ruined places,—thus saith Jehovah of hosts: They shall build, but I will throw down; and [men] shall call them the territory of wickedness, and the people against whom Jehovah hath indignation for ever.",
    "Malachi 1:5": "And your eyes shall see [it], and ye shall say, Jehovah is magnified beyond the border of Israel.",
    "Malachi 1:6": "A son honoureth [his] father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith Jehovah of hosts unto you, priests, that despise my name. But ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?",
    "Malachi 1:7": "Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of Jehovah is contemptible.",
    "Malachi 1:8": "And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? And if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? Present it now unto thy governor: will he be pleased with thee? or will he accept thy person? saith Jehovah of hosts.",
    "Malachi 1:9": "And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us. This hath been of your hand: will he accept any of your persons? saith Jehovah of hosts.",
    "Malachi 1:10": "Who is there among you that would even shut the doors? and ye would not kindle [fire] on mine altar for nothing. I have no delight in you, saith Jehovah of hosts, neither will I accept an oblation at your hand.",
    "Malachi 1:11": "For from the rising of the sun even unto its setting my name shall be great among the nations; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure oblation: for my name shall be great among the nations, saith Jehovah of hosts.",
    "Malachi 1:12": "But ye profane it, in that ye say, The table of the Lord is polluted; and the fruit thereof, his food, is contemptible.",
    "Malachi 1:13": "And ye say, Behold, what a weariness! And ye have puffed at it, saith Jehovah of hosts, and ye bring [that which was] torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye bring the oblation: should I accept this of your hand? saith Jehovah.",
    "Malachi 1:14": "Yea, cursed be the deceiver, who hath in his flock a male, and voweth and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing; for I am a great King, saith Jehovah of hosts, and my name is terrible among the nations.",
    "Malachi 2:1": "And now, ye priests, this commandment is for you.",
    "Malachi 2:2": "If ye do not hear, and if ye do not lay [it] to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith Jehovah of hosts, I will even send the curse among you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have already cursed them, because ye do not lay [it] to heart.",
    "Malachi 2:3": "Behold, I will rebuke your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, the dung of your feasts; and they shall take you away with it.",
    "Malachi 2:4": "And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith Jehovah of hosts.",
    "Malachi 2:5": "My covenant with him was of life and peace, and I gave them to him that he might fear; and he feared me, and trembled before my name.",
    "Malachi 2:6": "The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity.",
    "Malachi 2:7": "For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and at his mouth they seek the law; for he is the messenger of Jehovah of hosts.",
    "Malachi 2:8": "But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith Jehovah of hosts.",
    "Malachi 2:9": "And I also have made you contemptible and base before all the people, because ye have not kept my ways, but have respect of persons in [administering] the law.",
    "Malachi 2:10": "Have we not all one father? Hath not one God created us? Why do we deal unfaithfully every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?",
    "Malachi 2:11": "Judah hath dealt unfaithfully, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the sanctuary of Jehovah which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god.",
    "Malachi 2:12": "Jehovah will cut off from the tents of Jacob the man that doeth this, him that calleth and him that answereth; and him that offereth an oblation unto Jehovah of hosts.",
    "Malachi 2:13": "And further ye do this: ye cover the altar of Jehovah with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, insomuch that he regardeth not the oblation any more, nor receiveth [it] with satisfaction at your hand.",
    "Malachi 2:14": "Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because Jehovah hath been a witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt unfaithfully: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.",
    "Malachi 2:15": "And did not one make [them]? and the remnant of the Spirit was his. And wherefore the one? He sought a seed of God. Take heed then to your spirit, and let none deal unfaithfully against the wife of his youth,",
    "Malachi 2:16": "(for I hate putting away, saith Jehovah the God of Israel;) and he covereth with violence his garment, saith Jehovah of hosts: take heed then to your spirit, that ye deal not unfaithfully.",
    "Malachi 2:17": "Ye have wearied Jehovah with your words, and ye say, Wherein have we wearied [him]? In that ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of Jehovah, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of judgment?",
    "Malachi 3:1": "Behold, I send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me; and the Lord whom ye seek will suddenly come to his temple, and the Angel of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he cometh, saith Jehovah of hosts.",
    "Malachi 3:2": "But who shall endure the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? For he will be like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ lye.",
    "Malachi 3:3": "And he shall sit [as] a refiner and purifier of silver; and he will purify the children of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver; and they shall offer unto Jehovah an oblation in righteousness.",
    "Malachi 3:4": "Then shall the oblation of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in former years.",
    "Malachi 3:5": "And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against the false swearers, and against those that oppress the hired servant in [his] wages, the widow and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger [from his right], and fear not me, saith Jehovah of hosts.",
    "Malachi 3:6": "For I Jehovah change not, and ye, sons of Jacob, are not consumed.",
    "Malachi 3:7": "Since the days of your fathers have ye departed from my statutes, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith Jehovah of hosts. But ye say, Wherein shall we return?",
    "Malachi 3:8": "Will a man rob God? But ye rob me. And ye say, Wherein do we rob thee? [In] tithes and heave-offerings.",
    "Malachi 3:9": "Ye are cursed with a curse; and me ye rob, [even] this whole nation.",
    "Malachi 3:10": "Bring the whole tithe into the treasure-house, that there may be food in my house, and prove me now herewith, saith Jehovah of hosts, if I open not to you the windows of the heavens, and pour you out a blessing, till there be no place for it.",
    "Malachi 3:11": "And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before the time in the field, saith Jehovah of hosts.",
    "Malachi 3:12": "And all nations shall call you blessed; for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith Jehovah of hosts.",
    "Malachi 3:13": "Your words have been stout against me, saith Jehovah; but ye say, What have we been speaking against thee?",
    "Malachi 3:14": "Ye say, It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we keep his charge, and that we walk mournfully before Jehovah of hosts?",
    "Malachi 3:15": "And now we hold the proud for happy; yea, they that work wickedness are built up; yea, they tempt God, and they escape.",
    "Malachi 3:16": "Then they that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another; and Jehovah observed [it], and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared Jehovah, and that thought upon his name.",
    "Malachi 3:17": "And they shall be unto me a peculiar treasure, saith Jehovah of hosts, in the day that I prepare; and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.",
    "Malachi 3:18": "And ye shall return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.",
    "Malachi 4:1": "For behold, the day cometh, burning as a furnace; and all the proud and all that work wickedness shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith Jehovah of hosts, so that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.",
    "Malachi 4:2": "And unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth and leap like fatted calves.",
    "Malachi 4:3": "And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I prepare, saith Jehovah of hosts.",
    "Malachi 4:4": "Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, the statutes and ordinances.",
    "Malachi 4:5": "Behold, I send unto you Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and terrible day of Jehovah.",
    "Malachi 4:6": "And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.",

    "Matthew 1:19": "But Joseph, her husband, being [a] righteous [man], and unwilling to expose her publicly, purposed to have put her away secretly;",
    "Matthew 1:20": "but while he pondered on these things, behold, an angel of [the] Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, fear not to take to [thee] Mary, thy wife, for that which is begotten in her is of [the] Holy Spirit.",
    "Matthew 1:21": "And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.",

    "Matthew 5:36": "Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.",
    "Matthew 5:37": "But let your word be Yea, yea; Nay, nay; but what is more than these is from evil.",

    "Matthew 5:45": "that ye may be [the] sons of your Father who is in [the] heavens; for he makes his sun rise on evil and good, and sends rain on just and unjust.",
    "Matthew 5:46": "For if ye should love those who love you, what reward have ye? Do not also the tax-gatherers the same?",
    "Matthew 5:47": "And if ye should salute your brethren only, what do ye extraordinary? Do not also the Gentiles the same?",
    "Matthew 5:48": "Be ye therefore perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.",

    "Matthew 6:9": "Thus therefore pray ye: Our Father who art in the heavens, let thy name be sanctified,",
    "Matthew 6:10": "let thy kingdom come, let thy will be done as in heaven so upon the earth;",

    "Matthew 6:30": "But if God so clothe the herbage of the field, which is to-day, and to-morrow is cast into [the] oven, will he not much rather you, O [ye] of little faith?",
    "Matthew 6:31": "Be not therefore careful, saying, What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or What shall we put on?",
    "Matthew 6:32": "for all these things the nations seek after; for your heavenly Father knows that ye have need of all these things.",

    "Matthew 7:13": "Enter in through the narrow gate, for wide the gate and broad the way that leads to destruction, and many are they who enter in through it.",
    "Matthew 7:14": "For narrow the gate and straitened the way that leads to life, and they are few who find it.",
    "Matthew 7:15": "But beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but within are ravening wolves.",
    "Matthew 7:16": "By their fruits ye shall know them. Do [men] gather a bunch of grapes from thorns, or from thistles figs?",
    "Matthew 7:17": "So every good tree produces good fruits, but the worthless tree produces bad fruits.",
    "Matthew 7:18": "A good tree cannot produce bad fruits, nor a worthless tree produce good fruits.",

    "Matthew 8:9": "For I also am a man under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say to this [one], Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my bondman, Do this, and he does it.",
    "Matthew 8:10": "And when Jesus heard it, he wondered, and said to those who followed, Verily I say unto you, Not even in Israel have I found so great faith.",
    "Matthew 8:11": "But I say unto you, that many shall come from [the] rising and setting [sun], and shall lie down at table with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens;",
    "Matthew 8:12": "but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.",

    "Matthew 8:21": "But another of his disciples said to him, Lord, suffer me first to go away and bury my father.",
    "Matthew 8:22": "But Jesus said to him, Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.",
    "Matthew 8:23": "And he went on board ship and his disciples followed him;",
    "Matthew 8:24": "and behold, [the water] became very agitated on the sea, so that the ship was covered by the waves; but he slept.",
    "Matthew 8:25": "And the disciples came and awoke him, saying, Lord save: we perish.",

    "Matthew 11:11": "Verily I say to you, that there is not arisen among [the] born of women a greater than John the baptist. But he who is a little one in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.",
    "Matthew 11:12": "But from the days of John the baptist until now, the kingdom of the heavens is taken by violence, and [the] violent seize on it.",

    "Matthew 11:17": "say, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced: we have mourned to you, and ye have not wailed.",

    "Matthew 11:19": "The Son of man has come eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a man [that is] eating and wine-drinking, a friend of tax-gatherers, and of sinners:—and wisdom has been justified by her children.",
    "Matthew 11:20": "Then began he to reproach the cities in which most of his works of power had taken place, because they had not repented.",
    "Matthew 11:21": "Woe to thee, Chorazin! woe to thee Bethsaida! for if the works of power which have taken place in you, had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, they had long ago repented in sackcloth and ashes.",
    "Matthew 11:22": "But I say to you, that it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in judgment-day than for you.",
    "Matthew 11:23": "And thou, Capernaum, who hast been raised up to heaven, shalt be brought down even to hades. For if the works of power which have taken place in thee, had taken place in Sodom, it had remained until this day.",

    "Matthew 11:25": "At that time, Jesus answering said, I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes.",
    "Matthew 11:26": "Yea, Father, for thus has it been well-pleasing in thy sight.",
    "Matthew 11:27": "All things have been delivered to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son but the Father, nor does any one know the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son may be pleased to reveal [him].",

    "Matthew 12:2": "But the Pharisees, seeing [it], said to him, Behold, thy disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on sabbath.",
    "Matthew 12:3": "But he said to them, Have ye not read what David did when he was hungry, and they that were with him?",
    "Matthew 12:4": "How he entered into the house of God, and ate the shewbread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those with him, but for the priests only?",
    "Matthew 12:5": "Or have ye not read in the law that on the sabbaths the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?",
    "Matthew 12:6": "But I say unto you, that there is here what is greater than the temple.",
    "Matthew 12:7": "But if ye had known what is: I will have mercy and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.",
    "Matthew 12:8": "For the Son of man is Lord of the sabbath.",
    "Matthew 12:9": "And, going away from thence, he came into their synagogue.",
    "Matthew 12:10": "And behold, there was a man having his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath? that they might accuse him.",
    "Matthew 12:11": "But he said to them, What man shall there be of you who has one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the sabbath, will not lay hold of it and raise [it] up?",
    "Matthew 12:12": "How much better then is a man than a sheep! So that it is lawful to do well on the sabbath.",
    "Matthew 12:13": "Then he says to the man, Stretch out thy hand. And he stretched [it] out, and it was restored sound as the other.",
    "Matthew 12:14": "But the Pharisees, having gone out, took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.",
    "Matthew 12:15": "But Jesus knowing [it], withdrew thence, and great crowds followed him; and he healed them all:",
    "Matthew 12:16": "and charged them strictly that they should not make him publicly known:",
    "Matthew 12:17": "that that might be fulfilled which was spoken through Esaias the prophet, saying,",
    "Matthew 12:18": "Behold my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul has found its delight. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall shew forth judgment to the nations.",
    "Matthew 12:19": "He shall not strive or cry out, nor shall any one hear his voice in the streets;",

    "Matthew 12:25": "But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not subsist.",
    "Matthew 12:26": "And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom subsist?",
    "Matthew 12:27": "And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, your sons, by whom do they cast [them] out? For this reason they shall be your judges.",
    "Matthew 12:28": "But if I by [the] Spirit of God cast out demons, then indeed the kingdom of God is come upon you.",
    "Matthew 12:29": "Or how can any one enter into the house of the strong [man] and plunder his goods, unless first he bind the strong [man]? and then he will plunder his house.",

    "Matthew 12:38": "Then answered him some of the scribes and Pharisees, saying, Teacher, we desire to see a sign from thee.",
    "Matthew 12:39": "But he, answering, said to them, A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it save the sign of Jonas the prophet.",
    "Matthew 12:40": "For even as Jonas was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, thus shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.",
    "Matthew 12:41": "Ninevites shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and behold, more than Jonas [is] here.",
    "Matthew 12:42": "A queen of [the] south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, more than Solomon [is] here.",

    "Matthew 12:44": "Then he says, I will return to my house whence I came out; and having come, he finds [it] unoccupied, swept, and adorned.",
    "Matthew 12:45": "Then he goes and takes with himself seven other spirits worse than himself, and entering in, they dwell there; and the last condition of that man becomes worse than the first. Thus shall it be to this wicked generation also.",
    "Matthew 12:46": "But while he was yet speaking to the crowds, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him.",
    "Matthew 12:47": "Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren are standing without, seeking to speak to thee.",
    "Matthew 12:48": "But he answering said to him that spoke to him, Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?",
    "Matthew 12:49": "And, stretching out his hand to his disciples, he said, Behold my mother and my brethren;",
    "Matthew 12:50": "for whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in [the] heavens, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.",
    "Matthew 13:1": "And that [same] day Jesus went out from the house and sat down by the sea.",
    "Matthew 13:2": "And great crowds were gathered together to him, so that going on board ship himself he sat down, and the whole crowd stood on the shore.",
    "Matthew 13:3": "And he spoke to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went out to sow:",
    "Matthew 13:4": "and as he sowed, some [grains] fell along the way, and the birds came and devoured them;",
    "Matthew 13:5": "and others fell upon the rocky places where they had not much earth, and immediately they sprang up out of [the ground] because of not having [any] depth of earth,",
    "Matthew 13:6": "but when the sun rose they were burned up, and because of not having [any] root were dried up;",
    "Matthew 13:7": "and others fell upon the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them;",
    "Matthew 13:8": "and others fell upon the good ground, and produced fruit, one a hundred, one sixty, and one thirty.",
    "Matthew 13:9": "He that has ears, let him hear.",
    "Matthew 13:10": "And the disciples came up and said to him, Why speakest thou to them in parables?",
    "Matthew 13:11": "And he answering said to them, Because to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it is not given;",
    "Matthew 13:12": "for whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall be caused to be in abundance; but he who has not, even what he has shall be taken away from him.",
    "Matthew 13:13": "For this cause I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear nor understand;",
    "Matthew 13:14": "and in them is filled up the prophecy of Esaias, which says, Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand, and beholding ye shall behold and not see;",
    "Matthew 13:15": "for the heart of this people has grown fat, and they have heard heavily with their ears, and they have closed their eyes as asleep, lest they should see with the eyes, and hear with the ears, and understand with the heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.",
    "Matthew 13:16": "But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear;",
    "Matthew 13:17": "for verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous [men] have desired to see the things which ye behold and did not see [them], and to hear the things which ye hear and did not hear [them].",
    "Matthew 13:18": "Ye, therefore, hear the parable of the sower.",
    "Matthew 13:19": "From every one who hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand [it], the wicked one comes and catches away what was sown in his heart: this is he that is sown by the wayside.",
    "Matthew 13:20": "But he that is sown on the rocky places—this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy,",
    "Matthew 13:21": "but has no root in himself, but is for a time only; and when tribulation or persecution happens on account of the word, he is immediately offended.",
    "Matthew 13:22": "And he that is sown among the thorns—this is he who hears the word, and the anxious care of this life, and the deceit of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.",
    "Matthew 13:23": "But he that is sown upon the good ground—this is he who hears and understands the word, who bears fruit also, and produces, one a hundred, one sixty, and one thirty.",
    "Matthew 13:24": "Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field;",
    "Matthew 13:25": "but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel amongst the wheat, and went away.",
    "Matthew 13:26": "But when the blade shot up and produced fruit, then appeared the darnel also.",
    "Matthew 13:27": "And the bondmen of the householder came up and said to him, Sir, hast thou not sown good seed in thy field? whence then has it darnel?",
    "Matthew 13:28": "And he said to them, A man [that is] an enemy has done this. And the bondmen said to him, Wilt thou then that we should go and gather it [up]?",
    "Matthew 13:29": "But he said, No; lest [in] gathering the darnel ye should root up the wheat with it.",
    "Matthew 13:30": "Suffer both to grow together unto the harvest, and in time of the harvest I will say to the harvestmen, Gather first the darnel, and bind it into bundles to burn it; but the wheat bring together into my granary.",
    "Matthew 13:31": "Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a grain of mustard [seed] which a man took and sowed in his field;",
    "Matthew 13:32": "which is less indeed than all seeds, but when it is grown is greater than herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches.",
    "Matthew 13:33": "He spoke another parable to them: The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until it had been all leavened.",
    "Matthew 13:34": "All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and without a parable he did not speak to them,",
    "Matthew 13:35": "so that that should be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from [the] world’s foundation.",
    "Matthew 13:36": "Then, having dismissed the crowds, he went into the house; and his disciples came to him, saying, Expound to us the parable of the darnel of the field.",
    "Matthew 13:37": "But he answering said, He that sows the good seed is the Son of man,",
    "Matthew 13:38": "and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom, but the darnel are the sons of the evil [one];",
    "Matthew 13:39": "and the enemy who has sowed it is the devil; and the harvest is [the] completion of [the] age, and the harvestmen are angels.",
    "Matthew 13:40": "As then the darnel is gathered and is burned in the fire, thus it shall be in the completion of the age.",
    "Matthew 13:41": "The Son of man shall send his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all offences, and those that practise lawlessness;",
    "Matthew 13:42": "and they shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.",
    "Matthew 13:43": "Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that has ears, let him hear.",
    "Matthew 13:44": "The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hid in the field, which a man having found has hid, and for the joy of it goes and sells all whatever he has, and buys that field.",
    "Matthew 13:45": "Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls;",
    "Matthew 13:46": "and having found one pearl of great value, he went and sold all whatever he had and bought it.",
    "Matthew 13:47": "Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a seine which has been cast into the sea, and which has gathered together of every kind,",
    "Matthew 13:48": "which, when it has been filled, having drawn up on the shore and sat down, they gathered the good into vessels and cast the worthless out.",
    "Matthew 13:49": "Thus shall it be in the completion of the age: the angels shall go forth and sever the wicked from the midst of the just,",
    "Matthew 13:50": "and shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.",
    "Matthew 13:51": "Jesus says to them, Have ye understood all these things? They say to him, Yea, [Lord].",
    "Matthew 13:52": "And he said to them, For this reason every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man [that is] a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old.",
    "Matthew 13:53": "And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these parables he withdrew thence.",
    "Matthew 13:54": "And having come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, Whence has this [man] this wisdom and these works of power?",
    "Matthew 13:55": "Is not this the son of the carpenter? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brethren James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?",
    "Matthew 13:56": "And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then has this [man] all these things?",
    "Matthew 13:57": "And they were offended in him. And Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honour, unless in his country and in his house.",
    "Matthew 13:58": "And he did not there many works of power, because of their unbelief.",
    "Matthew 14:1": "At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,",
    "Matthew 14:2": "and said to his servants, This is John the baptist: he is risen from the dead, and because of this these works of power display their force in him.",
    "Matthew 14:3": "For Herod had seized John, and had bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother.",
    "Matthew 14:4": "For John said to him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.",
    "Matthew 14:5": "And [while] desiring to kill him, he feared the crowd, because they held him for a prophet.",
    "Matthew 14:6": "But when Herod’s birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod;",
    "Matthew 14:7": "whereupon he promised with oath to give her whatsoever she should ask.",
    "Matthew 14:8": "But she, being set on by her mother, says, Give me here upon a dish the head of John the baptist.",
    "Matthew 14:9": "And the king was grieved; but on account of the oaths, and those lying at table with [him], he commanded [it] to be given.",
    "Matthew 14:10": "And he sent and beheaded John in the prison;",
    "Matthew 14:11": "and his head was brought upon a dish, and was given to the damsel, and she carried [it] to her mother.",
    "Matthew 14:12": "And his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and came and brought word to Jesus.",
    "Matthew 14:13": "And Jesus, having heard it, went away thence by ship to a desert place apart. And the crowds having heard [of it] followed him on foot from the cities.",
    "Matthew 14:14": "And going out he saw a great crowd, and was moved with compassion about them, and healed their infirm.",
    "Matthew 14:15": "But when even was come, his disciples came to him saying, The place is desert, and [much of] the [day] time already gone by; dismiss the crowds, that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.",
    "Matthew 14:16": "But Jesus said to them, They have no need to go: give ye them to eat.",
    "Matthew 14:17": "But they say to him, We have not here save five loaves and two fishes.",
    "Matthew 14:18": "And he said, Bring them here to me.",
    "Matthew 14:19": "And having commanded the crowds to recline upon the grass, having taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed: and having broken the loaves, he gave [them] to the disciples, and the disciples [gave them] to the crowds.",
    "Matthew 14:20": "And all ate and were filled, and they took up what was over and above of fragments twelve hand-baskets full.",
    "Matthew 14:21": "But those that had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.",
    "Matthew 14:22": "And immediately he compelled the disciples to go on board ship, and to go on before him to the other side, until he should have dismissed the crowds.",
    "Matthew 14:23": "And having dismissed the crowds, he went up into the mountain apart to pray. And when even was come, he was alone there,",
    "Matthew 14:24": "but the ship was already in the middle of the sea tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.",
    "Matthew 14:25": "But in the fourth watch of the night he went off to them, walking on the sea.",
    "Matthew 14:26": "And the disciples, seeing him walking on the sea, were troubled, saying, It is an apparition. And they cried out through fear.",
    "Matthew 14:27": "But Jesus immediately spoke to them, saying, Take courage; it is I: be not afraid.",
    "Matthew 14:28": "And Peter answering him said, Lord, if it be thou, command me to come to thee upon the waters.",
    "Matthew 14:29": "And he said, Come. And Peter, having descended from the ship, walked upon the waters to go to Jesus.",
    "Matthew 14:30": "But seeing the wind strong he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.",
    "Matthew 14:31": "And immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and caught hold of him, and says to him, O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt?",
    "Matthew 14:32": "And when they had gone up into the ship, the wind fell.",
    "Matthew 14:33": "But those in the ship came and did homage to him, saying, Truly thou art God’s Son.",
    "Matthew 14:34": "And having crossed over they came to the land of Gennesaret.",
    "Matthew 14:35": "And when the men of that place recognised him, they sent to that whole country around, and they brought to him all that were ill,",
    "Matthew 14:36": "and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment; and as many as touched were made thoroughly well.",
    "Matthew 15:1": "Then the scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem come up to Jesus, saying,",
    "Matthew 15:2": "Why do thy disciples transgress what has been delivered by the ancients? for they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.",
    "Matthew 15:3": "But he answering said to them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God on account of your traditional teaching?",
    "Matthew 15:4": "For God commanded saying, Honour father and mother; and, He that speaks ill of father or mother, let him die the death.",
    "Matthew 15:5": "But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or mother, It is a gift, whatsoever [it be] by which [received] from me thou wouldest be profited:",
    "Matthew 15:6": "and he shall in no wise honour his father or his mother; and ye have made void the commandment of God on account of your traditional teaching.",
    "Matthew 15:7": "Hypocrites! well has Esaias prophesied about you, saying,",
    "Matthew 15:8": "This people honour me with the lips, but their heart is far away from me;",
    "Matthew 15:9": "but in vain do they worship me, teaching [as] teachings commandments of men.",
    "Matthew 15:10": "And having called to [him] the crowd, he said to them, Hear and understand:",
    "Matthew 15:11": "Not what enters into the mouth defiles the man; but what goes forth out of the mouth, this defiles the man.",
    "Matthew 15:12": "Then his disciples, coming up, said to him, Dost thou know that the Pharisees, having heard this word, have been offended?",
    "Matthew 15:13": "But he answering said, Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up.",
    "Matthew 15:14": "Leave them alone; they are blind leaders of blind: but if blind lead blind, both will fall into a ditch.",
    "Matthew 15:15": "And Peter answering said to him, Expound to us this parable.",
    "Matthew 15:16": "But he said, Are ye also still without intelligence?",
    "Matthew 15:17": "Do ye not yet apprehend, that everything that enters into the mouth finds its way into the belly, and is cast forth into the draught?",
    "Matthew 15:18": "but the things which go forth out of the mouth come out of the heart, and those defile man.",
    "Matthew 15:19": "For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnessings, blasphemies;",
    "Matthew 15:20": "these are the things which defile man; but the eating with unwashen hands does not defile man.",
    "Matthew 15:21": "And Jesus, going forth from thence, went away into the parts of Tyre and Sidon;",
    "Matthew 15:22": "and lo, a Canaanitish woman, coming out from those borders, cried [to him] saying, Have pity on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is miserably possessed by a demon.",
    "Matthew 15:23": "But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came to [him] and asked him, saying, Dismiss her, for she cries after us.",

    "Matthew 15:25": "But she came and did him homage, saying, Lord, help me.",
    "Matthew 15:26": "But he answering said, It is not well to take the bread of the children and cast it to the dogs.",
    "Matthew 15:27": "But she said, Yea, Lord; for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the table of their masters.",
    "Matthew 15:28": "Then Jesus answering said to her, O woman, thy faith [is] great. Be it to thee as thou desirest. And her daughter was healed from that hour.",
    "Matthew 15:29": "And Jesus, going away from thence, came towards the sea of Galilee, and he went up into the mountain and sat down there;",
    "Matthew 15:30": "and great crowds came to him, having with them lame, blind, dumb, crippled, and many others, and they cast them at his feet, and he healed them:",
    "Matthew 15:31": "so that the crowds wondered, seeing dumb speaking, crippled sound, lame walking, and blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.",
    "Matthew 15:32": "But Jesus, having called his disciples to [him], said, I have compassion on the crowd, because they have stayed with me already three days and they have not anything they can eat, and I would not send them away fasting lest they should faint on the way.",
    "Matthew 15:33": "And his disciples say to him, Whence should we have so many loaves in [the] wilderness as to satisfy so great a crowd?",
    "Matthew 15:34": "And Jesus says to them, How many loaves have ye? But they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.",
    "Matthew 15:35": "And he commanded the crowds to lie down on the ground;",

    "Matthew 16:10": "nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took [up]?",
    "Matthew 16:11": "How do ye not understand that [it was] not concerning bread I said to you, Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?",
    "Matthew 16:12": "Then they comprehended that he did not speak of being beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees.",
    "Matthew 16:13": "But when Jesus was come into the parts of Caesarea-Philippi, he demanded of his disciples, saying, Who do men say that I the Son of man am?",

    "Matthew 16:15": "He says to them, But ye, who do ye say that I am?",
    "Matthew 16:16": "And Simon Peter answering said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.",
    "Matthew 16:17": "And Jesus answering said to him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for flesh and blood has not revealed [it] to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens.",

    "Matthew 16:25": "For whosoever shall desire to save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it.",
    "Matthew 16:26": "For what does a man profit, if he should gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?",
    "Matthew 16:27": "For the Son of man is about to come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will render to each according to his doings.",

    "Matthew 17:11": "And he answering said to them, Elias indeed comes first and will restore all things.",
    "Matthew 17:12": "But I say unto you that Elias has already come, and they have not known him, but have done unto him whatever they would. Thus also the Son of man is about to suffer from them.",
    "Matthew 17:13": "Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the baptist.",
    "Matthew 17:14": "And when they came to the crowd, a man came to him, falling on his knees before him, and saying,",

    "Matthew 17:19": "Then the disciples, coming to Jesus apart, said [to him], Why were not we able to cast him out?",
    "Matthew 17:20": "And he says to them, Because of your unbelief; for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard [seed], ye shall say to this mountain, Be transported hence there, and it shall transport itself; and nothing shall be impossible to you.",
    "Matthew 17:21": "But this kind does not go out but by prayer and fasting.",
    "Matthew 17:22": "And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man is about to be delivered up into [the] hands of men,",

    "Matthew 17:26": "Peter says to him, From strangers. Jesus said to him, Then are the sons free.",
    "Matthew 17:27": "But that we may not be an offence to them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up, and when thou hast opened its mouth thou wilt find a stater; take that and give it to them for me and thee.",
    "Matthew 18:1": "In that hour the disciples came to Jesus saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?",
    "Matthew 18:2": "And Jesus having called a little child to [him], set it in their midst,",
    "Matthew 18:3": "and said, Verily I say to you, Unless ye are converted and become as little children, ye will not at all enter into the kingdom of the heavens.",
    "Matthew 18:4": "Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens;",
    "Matthew 18:5": "and whosoever shall receive one such little child in my name, receives me.",
    "Matthew 18:6": "But whosoever shall offend one of these little ones who believe in me, it were profitable for him that a great millstone had been hanged upon his neck and he be sunk in the depths of the sea.",
    "Matthew 18:7": "Woe to the world because of offences! For it must needs be that offences come; yet woe to that man by whom the offence comes!",
    "Matthew 18:8": "And if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut it off and cast [it] from thee; it is good for thee to enter into life lame or maimed, [rather] than having two hands or two feet to be cast into eternal fire.",

    "Matthew 18:12": "What think ye? If a certain man should have a hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, does he not, leaving the ninety and nine on the mountains, go and seek the one that has gone astray?",
    "Matthew 18:13": "And if it should come to pass that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoices more because of it than because of the ninety and nine not gone astray.",
    "Matthew 18:14": "So it is not the will of your Father who is in [the] heavens that one of these little ones should perish.",
    "Matthew 18:15": "But if thy brother sin against thee, go, reprove him between thee and him alone. If he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.",

    "Matthew 18:30": "But he would not, but went away and cast him into prison, until he should pay what was owing.",
    "Matthew 18:31": "But his fellow-bondmen, having seen what had taken place, were greatly grieved, and went and recounted to their lord all that had taken place.",
    "Matthew 18:32": "Then his lord, having called him to [him], says to him, Wicked bondman! I forgave thee all that debt because thou besoughtest me;",
    "Matthew 18:33": "shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow-bondman, as I also had compassion on thee?",
    "Matthew 18:34": "And his lord being angry delivered him to the tormentors till he paid all that was owing to him.",
    "Matthew 18:35": "Thus also my heavenly Father shall do to you if ye forgive not from your hearts every one his brother.",
    "Matthew 19:1": "And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these words, he withdrew from Galilee, and came to the coasts of Judaea beyond the Jordan;",
    "Matthew 19:2": "and great crowds followed him, and he healed them there.",
    "Matthew 19:3": "And the Pharisees came to him tempting him, and saying, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?",
    "Matthew 19:4": "But he answering said [to them], Have ye not read that he who made [them], from the beginning made them male and female,",
    "Matthew 19:5": "and said, On account of this a man shall leave father and mother, and shall be united to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh?",
    "Matthew 19:6": "so that they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.",
    "Matthew 19:7": "They say to him, Why then did Moses command to give a letter of divorce and to send [her] away?",
    "Matthew 19:8": "He says to them, Moses, in view of your hardheartedness, allowed you to put away your wives; but from the beginning it was not thus.",
    "Matthew 19:9": "But I say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, not for fornication, and shall marry another, commits adultery; and he who marries one put away commits adultery.",

    "Matthew 19:15": "and having laid his hands upon them, he departed thence.",
    "Matthew 19:16": "And lo, one coming up said to him, Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have life eternal?",
    "Matthew 19:17": "And he said to him, What askest thou me concerning goodness? one is good. But if thou wouldest enter into life, keep the commandments.",
    "Matthew 19:18": "He says to him, Which? And Jesus said, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,",

    "Matthew 19:28": "And Jesus said to them, Verily I say unto you, That ye who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit down upon his throne of glory, ye also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.",
    "Matthew 19:29": "And every one who has left houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit life eternal.",
    "Matthew 19:30": "But many first shall be last, and last first.",
    "Matthew 20:1": "For the kingdom of the heavens is like a householder who went out with the early morn to hire workmen for his vineyard.",
    "Matthew 20:2": "And having agreed with the workmen for a denarius the day, he sent them into his vineyard.",
    "Matthew 20:3": "And having gone out about [the] third hour, he saw others standing in the market-place idle;",

    "Matthew 20:8": "But when the evening was come, the lord of the vineyard says to his steward, Call the workmen and pay [them] their wages, beginning from the last even to the first.",
    "Matthew 20:9": "And when they [who came to work] about the eleventh hour came, they received each a denarius.",
    "Matthew 20:10": "And when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more, and they received also themselves each a denarius.",
    "Matthew 20:11": "And on receiving it they murmured against the master of the house,",
    "Matthew 20:12": "saying, These last have worked one hour, and thou hast made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the heat.",
    "Matthew 20:13": "But he answering said to one of them, [My] friend, I do not wrong thee. Didst thou not agree with me for a denarius?",
    "Matthew 20:14": "Take what is thine and go. But it is my will to give to this last even as to thee:",
    "Matthew 20:15": "is it not lawful for me to do what I will in my own affairs? Is thine eye evil because I am good?",
    "Matthew 20:16": "Thus shall the last be first, and the first last; for many are called ones, but few chosen ones.",
    "Matthew 20:17": "And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples with [him] apart in the way, and said to them,",
    "Matthew 20:18": "Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be delivered up to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death;",

    "Matthew 20:22": "And Jesus answering said, Ye know not what ye ask. Can ye drink the cup which I am about to drink? They say to him, We are able.",
    "Matthew 20:23": "[And] he says to them, Ye shall drink indeed my cup, but to sit on my right hand and on [my] left, is not mine to give, but to those for whom it is prepared of my Father.",
    "Matthew 20:24": "And the ten, having heard [of it], were indignant about the two brothers.",
    "Matthew 20:25": "But Jesus having called them to [him], said, Ye know that the rulers of the nations exercise lordship over them, and the great exercise authority over them.",
    "Matthew 20:26": "It shall not be thus amongst you, but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your servant;",
    "Matthew 20:27": "and whosoever will be first among you, let him be your bondman;",
    "Matthew 20:28": "as indeed the Son of man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.",
    "Matthew 20:29": "And as they went out from Jericho a great crowd followed him.",

    "Matthew 21:3": "And if any one say anything to you, ye shall say, The Lord has need of them, and straightway he will send them.",
    "Matthew 21:4": "But all this came to pass, that that might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,",
    "Matthew 21:5": "Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold thy King cometh to thee, meek, and mounted upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.",
    "Matthew 21:6": "But the disciples, having gone and done as Jesus had ordered them,",

    "Matthew 21:18": "But early in the morning, as he came back into the city, he hungered.",
    "Matthew 21:19": "And seeing one fig-tree in the way, he came to it and found on it nothing but leaves only. And he says to it, Let there be never more fruit of thee for ever. And the fig-tree was immediately dried up.",
    "Matthew 21:20": "And when the disciples saw [it], they wondered, saying, How immediately is the fig-tree dried up!",
    "Matthew 21:21": "And Jesus answering said to them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and do not doubt, not only shall ye do what [is done] to the fig-tree, but even if ye should say to this mountain, Be thou taken away and be thou cast into the sea, it shall come to pass.",

    "Mark 1:38": "And he says to them, Let us go elsewhere into the neighbouring country towns, that I may preach there also, for for this purpose am I come forth.",
    "Mark 1:39": "And he was preaching in their synagogues in the whole of Galilee, and casting out demons.",
    "Mark 1:40": "And there comes to him a leper, beseeching him, and falling on his knees to him, and saying to him, If thou wilt thou canst cleanse me.",
    "Mark 1:41": "But Jesus, moved with compassion, having stretched out his hand, touched him, and says to him, I will, be thou cleansed.",
    "Mark 1:42": "And as he spoke straightway the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed.",
    "Mark 1:43": "And having sharply charged him, he straightway sent him away,",
    "Mark 1:44": "and says to him, See thou say nothing to any one, but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing what Moses ordained, for a testimony to them.",
    "Mark 1:45": "But he, having gone forth, began to proclaim [it] much, and to spread the matter abroad, so that he could no longer enter openly into the city, but was without in desert places, and they came to him from every side.",

    "Mark 2:2": "and straightway many were gathered together, so that there was no longer any room, not even at the door; and he spoke the word to them.",
    "Mark 2:3": "And there come to him [men] bringing a paralytic, borne by four;",
    "Mark 2:4": "and, not being able to get near to him on account of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was, and having dug [it] up they let down the couch on which the paralytic lay.",
    "Mark 2:5": "But Jesus, seeing their faith, says to the paralytic, Child, thy sins are forgiven [thee].",
    "Mark 2:6": "But certain of the scribes were there sitting, and reasoning in their hearts,",
    "Mark 2:7": "Why does this [man] thus speak? he blasphemes. Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?",
    "Mark 2:8": "And straightway Jesus, knowing in his spirit that they are reasoning thus within themselves, said to them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?",
    "Mark 2:9": "Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, [Thy] sins are forgiven [thee]; or to say, Arise, and take up thy couch and walk?",
    "Mark 2:10": "But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, he says to the paralytic,",
    "Mark 2:11": "To thee I say, Arise, take up thy couch and go to thine house.",
    "Mark 2:12": "And he rose up straightway, and, having taken up his couch, went out before [them] all, so that all were amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it thus.",
    "Mark 2:13": "And he went out again by the sea, and all the crowd came to him, and he taught them.",
    "Mark 2:14": "And passing by, he saw Levi the [son] of Alphaeus sitting at the tax-office, and says to him, Follow me. And he rose up and followed him.",
    "Mark 2:15": "And it came to pass as he lay at table in his house, that many tax-gatherers and sinners lay at table with Jesus and his disciples; for they were many, and they followed him.",
    "Mark 2:16": "And the scribes and the Pharisees, seeing him eating with sinners and tax-gatherers, said to his disciples, Why [is it] that he eats and drinks with tax-gatherers and sinners?",
    "Mark 2:17": "And Jesus having heard [it] says to them, They that are strong have not need of a physician, but those who are ill. I have not come to call righteous [men], but sinners.",
    "Mark 2:18": "And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting; and they come and say to him, Why do the disciples of John and [the disciples] of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?",
    "Mark 2:19": "And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bride-chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast.",
    "Mark 2:20": "But days will come when the bridegroom shall have been taken away from them, and then shall they fast in that day.",
    "Mark 2:21": "No one sews a patch of new cloth on an old garment: otherwise its new filling-up takes from the old [stuff], and there is a worse rent.",
    "Mark 2:22": "And no one puts new wine into old skins; otherwise the wine bursts the skins, and the wine is poured out, and the skins will be destroyed; but new wine is to be put into new skins.",
    "Mark 2:23": "And it came to pass that he went on the sabbath through the cornfields; and his disciples began to walk on, plucking the ears.",
    "Mark 2:24": "And the Pharisees said to him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath what is not lawful?",
    "Mark 2:25": "And he said to them, Have ye never read what David did when he had need and hungered, he and those with him,",
    "Mark 2:26": "how he entered into the house of God, in [the section of] Abiathar [the] high priest, and ate the shew-bread, which it is not lawful unless for the priests to eat, and gave even to those that were with him?",
    "Mark 2:27": "And he said to them, The sabbath was made on account of man, not man on account of the sabbath;",
    "Mark 2:28": "so that the Son of man is lord of the sabbath also.",
    "Mark 3:1": "And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was there a man having his hand dried up.",
    "Mark 3:2": "And they watched him if he would heal him on the sabbath, that they might accuse him.",
    "Mark 3:3": "And he says to the man who had his hand dried up, Rise up [and come] into the midst.",
    "Mark 3:4": "And he says to them, Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill? But they were silent.",
    "Mark 3:5": "And looking round upon them with anger, distressed at the hardening of their heart, he says to the man, Stretch out thy hand. And he stretched [it] out, and his hand was restored.",
    "Mark 3:6": "And the Pharisees going out straightway with the Herodians took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.",
    "Mark 3:7": "And Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea; and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,",
    "Mark 3:8": "and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea and beyond the Jordan; and they of around Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, having heard what things he did, came to him.",
    "Mark 3:9": "And he spoke to his disciples, in order that a little ship should wait upon him on account of the crowd, that they might not press upon him.",
    "Mark 3:10": "For he healed many, so that they beset him that they might touch him, as many as had plagues.",
    "Mark 3:11": "And the unclean spirits, when they beheld him, fell down before him, and cried saying, Thou art the Son of God.",
    "Mark 3:12": "And he rebuked them much, that they might not make him manifest.",
    "Mark 3:13": "And he goes up into the mountain, and calls whom he himself would, and they went to him.",
    "Mark 3:14": "And he appointed twelve that they might be with him, and that he might send them to preach,",
    "Mark 3:15": "and to have power [to heal diseases, and] to cast out demons.",
    "Mark 3:16": "And he gave to Simon the surname of Peter;",
    "Mark 3:17": "and James the [son] of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, and he gave them the surname of Boanerges, that is, Sons of thunder;",
    "Mark 3:18": "and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the [son] of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean,",

    "Mark 3:23": "And having called them to [him], he said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?",
    "Mark 3:24": "And if a kingdom has become divided against itself, that kingdom cannot subsist.",
    "Mark 3:25": "And if a house has become divided against itself, that house cannot subsist.",
    "Mark 3:26": "And if Satan rise up against himself, and is divided, he cannot subsist, but has an end.",
    "Mark 3:27": "But no one can, having entered into his house, plunder the goods of the strong [man] unless he first bind the strong [man], and then he will plunder his house.",
    "Mark 3:28": "Verily I say unto you, that all sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and all the injurious speeches [with] which they may speak injuriously;",
    "Mark 3:29": "but whosoever shall speak injuriously against the Holy Spirit, to eternity has no forgiveness; but lies under the guilt of an everlasting sin;",
    "Mark 3:30": "because they said, he has an unclean spirit.",
    "Mark 3:31": "And his brethren and his mother come, and standing without sent to him calling him.",
    "Mark 3:32": "And a crowd sat around him. And they said to him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren seek thee without.",
    "Mark 3:33": "And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother or my brethren?",
    "Mark 3:34": "And looking around in a circuit at those that were sitting around him, he says, Behold my mother and my brethren:",
    "Mark 3:35": "for whosoever shall do the will of God, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.",
    "Mark 4:1": "And again he began to teach by the sea. And a great crowd was gathered together to him, so that going on board ship he sat in the sea, and all the crowd were close to the sea on the land.",
    "Mark 4:2": "And he taught them many things in parables. And he said to them in his doctrine,",
    "Mark 4:3": "Hearken: Behold, the sower went forth to sow.",
    "Mark 4:4": "And it came to pass as he sowed, one fell by the wayside, and the birds came and devoured it.",
    "Mark 4:5": "And another fell on the rocky ground, where it had not much earth, and immediately it sprung up out [of the ground] because it had no depth of earth;",
    "Mark 4:6": "and when the sun arose it was burnt up, and because of its not having any root, it withered.",
    "Mark 4:7": "And another fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.",
    "Mark 4:8": "And another fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing; and bore, one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.",
    "Mark 4:9": "And he said, He that has ears to hear, let him hear.",
    "Mark 4:10": "And when he was alone, those about him with the twelve asked him [as to] the parables.",
    "Mark 4:11": "And he said to them, To you is given [to know] the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to them who are without, all things are done in parables,",
    "Mark 4:12": "that beholding they may behold and not see, and hearing they may hear and not understand, lest it may be, they should be converted and they should be forgiven.",
    "Mark 4:13": "And he says to them, Do ye not know this parable? and how will ye be acquainted with all the parables?",
    "Mark 4:14": "The sower sows the word:",
    "Mark 4:15": "and these are they by the wayside where the word is sown, and when they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.",
    "Mark 4:16": "And these are they in like manner who are sown upon the rocky places, who when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy,",
    "Mark 4:17": "and they have no root in themselves, but are for a time: then, tribulation arising, or persecution on account of the word, immediately they are offended.",
    "Mark 4:18": "And others are they who are sown among the thorns: these are they who have heard the word,",
    "Mark 4:19": "and the cares of life, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things, entering in, choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.",
    "Mark 4:20": "And these are they who have been sown on the good ground, such as hear the word and receive it, and bear fruit; one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred [fold].",
    "Mark 4:21": "And he said to them, Does the lamp come that it should be put under the bushel or under the couch? [Is it] not that it should be set upon the lamp-stand?",
    "Mark 4:22": "For there is nothing hidden which shall not be made manifest; nor does any secret thing take place, but that it should come to light.",
    "Mark 4:23": "If any one have ears to hear, let him hear.",
    "Mark 4:24": "And he said to them, Take heed what ye hear; with what measure ye mete, it shall be meted to you; and there shall be [more] added to you.",
    "Mark 4:25": "For whosoever has, to him shall be given; and he who has not, even what he has shall be taken from him.",
    "Mark 4:26": "And he said, Thus is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast the seed upon the earth,",
    "Mark 4:27": "and should sleep and rise up night and day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he does not know how.",
    "Mark 4:28": "The earth bears fruit of itself, first [the] blade, then an ear, then full corn in the ear.",
    "Mark 4:29": "But when the fruit is produced, immediately he sends the sickle, for the harvest is come.",
    "Mark 4:30": "And he said, How should we liken the kingdom of God, or with what comparison should we compare it?",
    "Mark 4:31": "As to a grain of mustard [seed], which, when it is sown upon the earth, is less than all seeds which are upon the earth,",
    "Mark 4:32": "and when it has been sown, mounts up and becomes greater than all herbs, and produces great branches, so that the birds of heaven can roost under its shadow.",
    "Mark 4:33": "And with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear,",
    "Mark 4:34": "but without a parable spoke he not to them; and in private he explained all things to his disciples.",
    "Mark 4:35": "And on that day, when evening was come, he says to them, Let us go over to the other side:",
    "Mark 4:36": "and having sent away the crowd, they take him with [them], as he was, in the ship. But other ships also were with him.",
    "Mark 4:37": "And there comes a violent gust of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it already filled.",
    "Mark 4:38": "And he was in the stern sleeping on the cushion. And they awake him up and say to him, Teacher, dost thou not care that we are perishing?",
    "Mark 4:39": "And awaking up he rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Silence; be mute. And the wind fell, and there was a great calm.",
    "Mark 4:40": "And he said to them, Why are ye [thus] fearful? how [is it] ye have not faith?",
    "Mark 4:41": "And they feared [with] great fear, and said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?",
    "Mark 5:1": "And they came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gadarenes.",
    "Mark 5:2": "And immediately on his going out of the ship there met him out of the tombs a man possessed by an unclean spirit,",
    "Mark 5:3": "who had his dwelling in the tombs; and no one was able to bind him, not even with chains;",
    "Mark 5:4": "because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn asunder by him, and the fetters were shattered; and no one was able to subdue him.",
    "Mark 5:5": "And continually night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying and cutting himself with stones.",
    "Mark 5:6": "But seeing Jesus from afar off, he ran and did him homage,",
    "Mark 5:7": "and crying with a loud voice he says, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure thee by God, torment me not.",
    "Mark 5:8": "For he said to him, Come forth, unclean spirit, out of the man.",
    "Mark 5:9": "And he asked him, What is thy name? And he says to him, Legion is my name, because we are many.",
    "Mark 5:10": "And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.",
    "Mark 5:11": "Now there was there just at the mountain a great herd of swine feeding;",
    "Mark 5:12": "and they besought him, saying, Send us into the swine that we may enter into them.",
    "Mark 5:13": "And Jesus [immediately] allowed them. And the unclean spirits going out entered into the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep slope, into the sea (about two thousand), and were choked in the sea.",
    "Mark 5:14": "And those that were feeding them fled and reported it in the city and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that had taken place.",
    "Mark 5:15": "And they come to Jesus, and they see the possessed of demons sitting [and] clothed and sensible, [him] that had had the legion: and they were afraid.",
    "Mark 5:16": "And they that had seen [it] related to them how it had happened to the [man] possessed by demons, and concerning the swine.",
    "Mark 5:17": "And they began to beg him to depart from their coasts.",
    "Mark 5:18": "And as he went on board ship, the man that had been possessed by demons besought him that he might be with him.",
    "Mark 5:19": "And he suffered him not, but says to him, Go to thine home to thine own people, and tell them how great things the Lord has done for thee, and has had mercy on thee.",
    "Mark 5:20": "And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him; and all wondered.",
    "Mark 5:21": "And Jesus having passed over in the ship again to the other side, a great crowd gathered to him; and he was by the sea.",
    "Mark 5:22": "And [behold] there comes one of the rulers of the synagogue, by name Jairus, and seeing him, falls down at his feet;",
    "Mark 5:23": "and he besought him much, saying, My little daughter is at extremity; [I pray] that thou shouldest come and lay thy hands upon her so that she may be healed, and may live.",
    "Mark 5:24": "And he went with him, and a large crowd followed him and pressed on him.",
    "Mark 5:25": "And a certain woman who had had a flux of blood twelve years,",
    "Mark 5:26": "and had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent everything she had and had found no advantage from it, but had rather got worse,",
    "Mark 5:27": "having heard concerning Jesus, came in the crowd behind and touched his clothes;",
    "Mark 5:28": "for she said, If I shall touch but his clothes I shall be healed.",
    "Mark 5:29": "And immediately her fountain of blood was dried up, and she knew in her body that she was cured from the scourge.",
    "Mark 5:30": "And immediately Jesus, knowing in himself the power that had gone out of him, turning round in the crowd said, Who has touched my clothes?",
    "Mark 5:31": "And his disciples said to him, Thou seest the crowd pressing on thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?",
    "Mark 5:32": "And he looked round about to see her who had done this.",
    "Mark 5:33": "But the woman, frightened and trembling, knowing what had taken place in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.",
    "Mark 5:34": "And he said to her, Daughter, thy faith has healed thee; go in peace, and be well of thy scourge.",
    "Mark 5:35": "While he was yet speaking, they come from the ruler of the synagogue’s [house], saying, Thy daughter has died, why troublest thou the teacher any further?",
    "Mark 5:36": "But Jesus [immediately], having heard the word spoken, says to the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not; only believe.",
    "Mark 5:37": "And he suffered no one to accompany him save Peter and James, and John the brother of James.",
    "Mark 5:38": "And he comes to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and sees the tumult, and people weeping and wailing greatly.",
    "Mark 5:39": "And entering in he says to them, Why do ye make a tumult and weep? the child has not died, but sleeps.",
    "Mark 5:40": "And they derided him. But he, having put [them] all out, takes with [him] the father of the child, and the mother, and those that were with him, and enters in where the child was lying.",
    "Mark 5:41": "And having laid hold of the hand of the child, he says to her, Talitha koumi, which is, interpreted, Damsel, I say to thee, Arise.",
    "Mark 5:42": "And immediately the damsel arose and walked, for she was twelve years old. And they were astonished with great astonishment.",
    "Mark 5:43": "And he charged them much that no one should know this; and he desired that [something] should be given her to eat.",
    "Mark 6:1": "And he went out thence and came to his own country, and his disciples follow him.",
    "Mark 6:2": "And when sabbath was come he began to teach in the synagogue, and many hearing were amazed, saying, Whence [has] this [man] these things? and what [is] the wisdom that is given to him, and such works of power are done by his hands?",
    "Mark 6:3": "Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended in him.",
    "Mark 6:4": "But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not despised save in his own country, and among [his] kinsmen, and in his own house.",
    "Mark 6:5": "And he could not do any work of power there, save that laying his hands on a few infirm persons he healed [them].",
    "Mark 6:6": "And he wondered because of their unbelief. And he went round the villages in a circuit, teaching.",
    "Mark 6:7": "And he calls the twelve to [him]; and he began to send them out two [and] two, and gave to them power over the unclean spirits;",
    "Mark 6:8": "and he commanded them that they should take nothing for the way, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their belt;",
    "Mark 6:9": "but be shod with sandals, and put not on two body-coats.",
    "Mark 6:10": "And he said to them, Wheresoever ye shall enter into a house, there remain till ye shall go thence.",
    "Mark 6:11": "And whatsoever place shall not receive you nor hear you, departing thence, shake off the dust which is under your feet for a testimony to them.",
    "Mark 6:12": "And they went forth and preached that they should repent;",
    "Mark 6:13": "and they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many infirm, and healed them.",
    "Mark 6:14": "And Herod the king heard [of him] (for his name had become public), and said, John the baptist is risen from among [the] dead, and on this account works of power are wrought by him.",
    "Mark 6:15": "And others said, It is Elias; and others said, It is a prophet, as one of the prophets.",
    "Mark 6:16": "But Herod when he heard [it] said, John whom I beheaded, he it is; he is risen [from among the dead].",
    "Mark 6:17": "For the same Herod had sent and seized John, and had bound him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother, because he had married her.",
    "Mark 6:18": "For John said to Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have the wife of thy brother.",
    "Mark 6:19": "But Herodias kept it [in her mind] against him, and wished to kill him, and could not:",
    "Mark 6:20": "for Herod feared John knowing that he was a just and holy man, and kept him safe; and having heard him, did many things, and heard him gladly.",
    "Mark 6:21": "And a holiday being come, when Herod, on his birthday, made a supper to his grandees, and to the chiliarchs, and the chief [men] of Galilee;",
    "Mark 6:22": "and the daughter of the same Herodias having come in, and danced, pleased Herod and those that were with [him] at table; and the king said to the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt and I will give it thee.",
    "Mark 6:23": "And he swore to her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask me I will give thee, to half of my kingdom.",
    "Mark 6:24": "And she went out, and said to her mother, What should I ask? And she said, The head of John the baptist.",
    "Mark 6:25": "And immediately going in with haste to the king, she asked saying, I desire that thou give me directly upon a dish the head of John the baptist.",
    "Mark 6:26": "And the king, [while] made very sorry, on account of the oaths and those lying at table with [him] would not break his word with her.",
    "Mark 6:27": "And immediately the king, having sent one of the guard, ordered his head to be brought. And he went out and beheaded him in the prison,",
    "Mark 6:28": "and brought his head upon a dish, and gave it to the damsel, and the damsel gave it to her mother.",
    "Mark 6:29": "And his disciples having heard [it], came and took up his body, and laid it in a tomb.",
    "Mark 6:30": "And the apostles are gathered together to Jesus. And they related to him all things, [both] what they had done and what they had taught.",
    "Mark 6:31": "And he said to them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a little. For those coming and those going were many, and they had not leisure even to eat.",
    "Mark 6:32": "And they went away apart into a desert place by ship.",
    "Mark 6:33": "And many saw them going, and recognised them, and ran together there on foot, out of all the cities, and got [there] before them.",
    "Mark 6:34": "And on leaving [the ship] [Jesus] saw a great crowd, and he was moved with compassion for them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd. And he began to teach them many things.",

    "Mark 6:37": "And he answering said to them, Give ye them to eat. And they say to him, Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give them to eat?",
    "Mark 6:38": "And he says to them, How many loaves have ye? Go [and] see. And when they knew they say, Five, and two fishes.",
    "Mark 6:39": "And he ordered them to make them all sit down by companies on the green grass.",
    "Mark 6:40": "And they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties.",
    "Mark 6:41": "And having taken the five loaves and the two fishes, looking up to heaven, he blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave [them] to his disciples that they might set [them] before them. And the two fishes he divided among all.",
    "Mark 6:42": "And they all ate and were satisfied.",
    "Mark 6:43": "And they took up of fragments the fillings of twelve hand-baskets, and of the fishes.",
    "Mark 6:44": "And those that ate of the loaves were five thousand men.",
    "Mark 6:45": "And immediately he compelled his disciples to go on board ship, and to go on before to the other side to Bethsaida, while he sends the crowd away.",
    "Mark 6:46": "And, having dismissed them, he departed into the mountain to pray.",
    "Mark 6:47": "And when evening was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone upon the land.",
    "Mark 6:48": "And seeing them labouring in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the night he comes to them walking on the sea, and would have passed them by.",
    "Mark 6:49": "But they, seeing him walking on the sea, thought that it was an apparition, and cried out.",
    "Mark 6:50": "For all saw him and were troubled. And immediately he spoke with them, and says to them, Be of good courage: it is I; be not afraid.",
    "Mark 6:51": "And he went up to them into the ship, and the wind fell. And they were exceedingly beyond measure astonished in themselves and wondered;",
    "Mark 6:52": "for they understood not through the loaves: for their heart was hardened.",
    "Mark 6:53": "And having passed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret and made the shore.",
    "Mark 6:54": "And on their coming out of the ship, immediately recognising him,",
    "Mark 6:55": "they ran through that whole country around, and began to carry about those that were ill on couches, where they heard that he was.",
    "Mark 6:56": "And wherever he entered into villages, or cities, or the country, they laid the sick in the market-places, and besought him that they might touch if it were only the hem of his garment; and as many as touched him were healed.",
    "Mark 7:1": "And the Pharisees and some of the scribes, coming from Jerusalem, are gathered together to him,",
    "Mark 7:2": "and seeing some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is, unwashed, hands,",
    "Mark 7:3": "(for the Pharisees and all the Jews, unless they wash their hands diligently, do not eat, holding what has been delivered by the ancients;",
    "Mark 7:4": "and [on coming] from the market-place, unless they are washed, they do not eat; and there are many other things which they have received to hold, the washing of cups and vessels, and brazen utensils, and couches),",
    "Mark 7:5": "then the Pharisees and the scribes ask him, Why do thy disciples not walk according to what has been delivered by the ancients, but eat the bread with defiled hands?",
    "Mark 7:6": "But he answering said to them, Well did Esaias prophesy concerning you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honour me with their lips, but their heart is far away from me.",
    "Mark 7:7": "But in vain do they worship me, teaching [as their] teachings commandments of men.",
    "Mark 7:8": "[For], leaving the commandment of God, ye hold what is delivered by men [to keep]—washings of vessels and cups, and many other such like things ye do.",
    "Mark 7:9": "And he said to them, Well do ye set aside the commandment of God, that ye may observe what is delivered by yourselves [to keep].",
    "Mark 7:10": "For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, he who speaks ill of father or mother, let him surely die.",
    "Mark 7:11": "But ye say, If a man say to his father or his mother, [It is] corban (that is, gift), whatsoever thou mightest have profit from me by...",
    "Mark 7:12": "And ye no longer suffer him to do anything for his father or his mother;",
    "Mark 7:13": "making void the word of God by your traditional teaching which ye have delivered; and many such like things ye do.",
    "Mark 7:14": "And having called again the crowd, he said to them, Hear me, all [of you], and understand:",
    "Mark 7:15": "There is nothing from outside a man entering into him which can defile him; but the things which go out from him, those it is which defile the man.",
    "Mark 7:16": "If any one have ears to hear, let him hear.",
    "Mark 7:17": "And when he went indoors from the crowd, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.",
    "Mark 7:18": "And he says to them, Are ye also thus unintelligent? Do ye not perceive that all that is outside entering into the man cannot defile him,",
    "Mark 7:19": "because it does not enter into his heart but into his belly, and goes out into the draught, purging all meats?",
    "Mark 7:20": "And he said, That which goes forth out of the man, that defiles the man.",
    "Mark 7:21": "For from within, out of the heart of men, go forth evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,",
    "Mark 7:22": "thefts, covetousness, wickednesses, deceit, licentiousness, a wicked eye, injurious language, haughtiness, folly;",
    "Mark 7:23": "all these wicked things go forth from within and defile the man.",
    "Mark 7:24": "And he rose up and went away thence into the borders of Tyre and Sidon; and having entered into a house he would not have any one know [it], and he could not be hid.",
    "Mark 7:25": "But immediately a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell at his feet",
    "Mark 7:26": "(and the woman was a Greek, Syrophenician by race), and asked him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.",
    "Mark 7:27": "But [Jesus] said to her, Suffer the children to be first filled; for it is not right to take the children’s bread and cast it to the dogs.",
    "Mark 7:28": "But she answered and says to him, Yea, Lord; for even the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.",
    "Mark 7:29": "And he said to her, Because of this word, go thy way, the demon is gone out of thy daughter.",
    "Mark 7:30": "And having gone away to her house she found the demon gone out, and her daughter lying on the bed.",
    "Mark 7:31": "And again having left the borders of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.",
    "Mark 7:32": "And they bring to him a deaf [man] who could not speak right, and they beseech him that he might lay his hand on him.",
    "Mark 7:33": "And having taken him away from the crowd apart, he put his fingers to his ears; and having spit, he touched his tongue;",
    "Mark 7:34": "and looking up to heaven he groaned, and says to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.",
    "Mark 7:35": "And immediately his ears were opened, and the band of his tongue was loosed and he spoke right.",
    "Mark 7:36": "And he charged them that they should speak to no one [of it]. But so much the more he charged them, so much the more abundantly they proclaimed it;",
    "Mark 7:37": "and they were astonished above measure, saying, He does all things well; he makes both the deaf to hear, and the speechless to speak.",
    "Mark 8:1": "In those days, there being again a great crowd, and they having nothing that they could eat, having called his disciples to [him], he says to them,",
    "Mark 8:2": "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have stayed with me already three days and they have not anything they can eat,",
    "Mark 8:3": "and if I should dismiss them to their home fasting, they will faint on the way; for some of them are come from far.",
    "Mark 8:4": "And his disciples answered him, Whence shall one be able to satisfy these with bread here in a desert place?",
    "Mark 8:5": "And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.",
    "Mark 8:6": "And he commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground. And having taken the seven loaves, he gave thanks, and broke [them] and gave [them] to his disciples, that they might set [them] before [them]; and they set [them] before the crowd.",
    "Mark 8:7": "And they had a few small fishes, and having blessed them, he desired these also to be set before [them].",
    "Mark 8:8": "And they ate and were satisfied. And they took up of fragments that remained seven baskets.",
    "Mark 8:9": "And they [that had eaten] were about four thousand; and he sent them away.",
    "Mark 8:10": "And immediately going on board ship with his disciples, he came into the parts of Dalmanutha.",
    "Mark 8:11": "And the Pharisees went out and began to dispute against him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, tempting him.",
    "Mark 8:12": "And groaning in his spirit, he says, Why does this generation seek a sign? Verily I say unto you, A sign shall in no wise be given to this generation.",
    "Mark 8:13": "And he left them, and going again on board ship, went away to the other side.",
    "Mark 8:14": "And they forgot to take bread, and save one loaf, they had not [any] with them in the ship.",
    "Mark 8:15": "And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and [of] the leaven of Herod.",
    "Mark 8:16": "And they reasoned with one another, [saying], It is because we have no bread.",
    "Mark 8:17": "And Jesus knowing [it], says to them, Why reason ye because ye have no bread? Do ye not yet perceive nor understand? Have ye your heart [yet] hardened?",
    "Mark 8:18": "Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?",
    "Mark 8:19": "When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many hand-baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say to him, Twelve.",
    "Mark 8:20": "And when the seven for the four thousand, the filling of how many baskets of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.",
    "Mark 8:21": "And he said to them, How do ye not yet understand?",
    "Mark 8:22": "And he comes to Bethsaida; and they bring him a blind man, and beseech him that he might touch him.",
    "Mark 8:23": "And taking hold of the hand of the blind man he led him forth out of the village, and having spit upon his eyes, he laid his hands upon him, and asked him if he beheld anything.",
    "Mark 8:24": "And having looked up, he said, I behold men, for I see [them], as trees, walking.",
    "Mark 8:25": "Then he laid his hands again upon his eyes, and he saw distinctly, and was restored and saw all things clearly.",
    "Mark 8:26": "And he sent him to his house, saying, Neither enter into the village, nor tell [it] to any one in the village.",
    "Mark 8:27": "And Jesus went forth and his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea-Philippi. And by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Who do men say that I am?",
    "Mark 8:28": "And they answered him, saying, John the baptist; and others, Elias; but others, One of the prophets.",
    "Mark 8:29": "And he asked them, But ye, who do ye say that I am? And Peter answering says to him, Thou art the Christ.",
    "Mark 8:30": "And he charged them straitly, in order that they should tell no man about him.",
    "Mark 8:31": "And he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and of the chief priests and of the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise [again].",
    "Mark 8:32": "And he spoke the thing openly. And Peter, taking him to [him], began to rebuke him.",
    "Mark 8:33": "But he, turning round and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, saying, Get away behind me, Satan, for thy mind is not on the things that are of God, but on the things that are of men.",
    "Mark 8:34": "And having called the crowd with his disciples, he said to them, Whoever desires to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me.",
    "Mark 8:35": "For whosoever shall desire to save his life shall lose it, but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s shall save it.",
    "Mark 8:36": "For what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his soul?",
    "Mark 8:37": "for what should a man give in exchange for his soul?",
    "Mark 8:38": "For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him shall the Son of man also be ashamed when he shall come in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.",
    "Mark 9:1": "And he said to them, Verily I say unto you, There are some of those standing here that shall not taste death until they shall have seen the kingdom of God come in power.",
    "Mark 9:2": "And after six days Jesus takes with [him] Peter and James and John, and takes them up on a high mountain by themselves apart. And he was transfigured before them:",
    "Mark 9:3": "and his garments became shining, exceeding white [as snow], such as fuller on earth could not whiten [them].",
    "Mark 9:4": "And there appeared to them Elias with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.",
    "Mark 9:5": "And Peter answering says to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good that we should be here; and let us make three tabernacles, for thee one, and for Moses one, and for Elias one.",
    "Mark 9:6": "For he knew not what he should say, for they were filled with fear.",
    "Mark 9:7": "And there came a cloud overshadowing them, and there came a voice out of the cloud, This is my beloved Son: hear him.",
    "Mark 9:8": "And suddenly having looked around, they no longer saw any one, but Jesus alone with themselves.",
    "Mark 9:9": "And as they descended from the mountain, he charged them that they should relate to no one what they had seen, unless when the Son of man should be risen from among [the] dead.",
    "Mark 9:10": "And they kept that saying, questioning among themselves, what rising from among [the] dead was.",
    "Mark 9:11": "And they asked him saying, Why do the scribes say that Elias must first have come?",
    "Mark 9:12": "And he answering said to them, Elias indeed, having first come, restores all things; and how is it written of the Son of man that he must suffer much, and be set at nought:",
    "Mark 9:13": "but I say unto you that Elias also is come, and they have done to him whatever they would, as it is written of him.",
    "Mark 9:14": "And when he came to the disciples he saw a great crowd around them, and scribes disputing against them.",
    "Mark 9:15": "And immediately all the crowd seeing him were amazed, and running to [him], saluted him.",
    "Mark 9:16": "And he asked them, What do ye question with them about?",
    "Mark 9:17": "And one out of the crowd answered him, Teacher, I brought to thee my son, who has a dumb spirit;",
    "Mark 9:18": "and wheresoever it seizes him it tears him, and he foams and gnashes his teeth, and he is withering away. And I spoke to thy disciples, that they might cast him out, and they could not.",
    "Mark 9:19": "But he answering them says, O unbelieving generation! how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him to me.",
    "Mark 9:20": "And they brought him to him. And seeing him the spirit immediately tore him; and falling upon the earth he rolled foaming.",
    "Mark 9:21": "And he asked his father, How long a time is it that it has been like this with him? And he said, From childhood;",
    "Mark 9:22": "and often it has cast him both into fire and into waters that it might destroy him: but if thou couldst [do] anything, be moved with pity on us, and help us.",
    "Mark 9:23": "And Jesus said to him, The ‘if thou couldst’ is [if thou couldst] believe: all things are possible to him that believes.",
    "Mark 9:24": "And immediately the father of the young child crying out said [with tears], I believe, help mine unbelief.",
    "Mark 9:25": "But Jesus, seeing that [the] crowd was running up together, rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.",
    "Mark 9:26": "And having cried out and torn [him] much, he came out; and he became as if dead, so that the most said, He is dead.",
    "Mark 9:27": "But Jesus, having taken hold of him by the hand, lifted him up, and he arose.",
    "Mark 9:28": "And when he was entered into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Wherefore could not we cast him out?",
    "Mark 9:29": "And he said to them, This kind can go out by nothing but by prayer and fasting.",
    "Mark 9:30": "And going forth from thence they went through Galilee; and he would not that any one knew it;",
    "Mark 9:31": "for he taught his disciples and said to them, The Son of man is delivered into men’s hands, and they shall kill him; and having been killed, after three days he shall rise again.",
    "Mark 9:32": "But they understood not the saying, and feared to ask him.",
    "Mark 9:33": "And he came to Capernaum, and being in the house, he asked them, Of what were ye reasoning by the way?",
    "Mark 9:34": "And they remained silent, for by the way they had been reasoning with one another who [was] greatest.",
    "Mark 9:35": "And sitting down he called the twelve; and he says to them, If any one would be first, he shall be last of all, and minister of all.",
    "Mark 9:36": "And taking a little child he set it in their midst, and having taken it in his arms he said to them,",
    "Mark 9:37": "Whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name, receives me; and whosoever shall receive me, does not receive me, but him who sent me.",
    "Mark 9:38": "And John answered him saying, Teacher, we saw some one casting out demons in thy name, who does not follow us, and we forbad him, because he does not follow us.",
    "Mark 9:39": "But Jesus said, Forbid him not; for there is no one who shall do a miracle in my name, and be able soon [after] to speak ill of me;",
    "Mark 9:40": "for he who is not against us is for us.",
    "Mark 9:41": "For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in [my] name, because ye are Christ’s, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.",
    "Mark 9:42": "And whosoever shall be a snare to one of the little ones who believe [in me], it were better for him if a millstone were hung about his neck, and he cast into the sea.",
    "Mark 9:43": "And if thy hand serve as a snare to thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having thy two hands to go away into hell, into the fire unquenchable;",
    "Mark 9:44": "[where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched].",
    "Mark 9:45": "And if thy foot serve as a snare to thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life lame, than having thy two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire unquenchable;",
    "Mark 9:46": "[where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched].",
    "Mark 9:47": "And if thine eye serve as a snare to thee, cast it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire,",
    "Mark 9:48": "where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.",
    "Mark 9:49": "For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.",
    "Mark 9:50": "Salt [is] good, but if the salt is become saltless, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.",
    "Mark 10:1": "And rising up thence he comes into the coasts of Judaea, and the other side of the Jordan. And again crowds come together to him, and, as he was accustomed, again he taught them.",
    "Mark 10:2": "And Pharisees coming to [him] asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away [his] wife? (tempting him).",
    "Mark 10:3": "But he answering said to them, What did Moses command you?",
    "Mark 10:4": "And they said, Moses allowed to write a bill of divorce, and to put away.",
    "Mark 10:5": "And Jesus answering said to them, In view of your hard-heartedness he wrote this commandment for you;",
    "Mark 10:6": "but from [the] beginning of [the] creation God made them male and female.",
    "Mark 10:7": "For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be united to his wife,",
    "Mark 10:8": "and the two shall be one flesh: so that they are no longer two but one flesh.",
    "Mark 10:9": "What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.",
    "Mark 10:10": "And again in the house the disciples asked him concerning this.",

    "Mark 10:15": "Verily I say to you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, shall in no wise enter into it.",
    "Mark 10:16": "And having taken them in his arms, having laid his hands on them, he blessed them.",
    "Mark 10:17": "And as he went forth into the way, a person ran up to [him], and kneeling to him asked him, Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?",
    "Mark 10:18": "But Jesus said to him, Why callest thou me good? no one is good but one, [that is] God.",
    "Mark 10:19": "Thou knowest the commandments: Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honour thy father and mother.",
    "Mark 10:20": "And he answering said to him, Teacher, all these things have I kept from my youth.",
    "Mark 10:21": "And Jesus looking upon him loved him, and said to him, One thing lackest thou: go, sell whatever thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, [taking up the cross].",
    "Mark 10:22": "But he, sad at the word, went away grieved, for he had large possessions.",
    "Mark 10:23": "And Jesus looking around says to his disciples, How difficultly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!",
    "Mark 10:24": "And the disciples were amazed at his words. And Jesus again answering says to them, Children, how difficult it is that those who trust in riches should enter into the kingdom of God!",
    "Mark 10:25": "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.",
    "Mark 10:26": "And they were exceedingly astonished, saying to one another, And who can be saved?",
    "Mark 10:27": "But Jesus looking on them says, With men it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God.",
    "Mark 10:28": "Peter began to say to him, Behold, we have left all things and have followed thee.",
    "Mark 10:29": "Jesus answering said, Verily I say to you, There is no one who has left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, [or wife], or children, or lands, for my sake and for the sake of the gospel,",
    "Mark 10:30": "that shall not receive a hundredfold now in this time: houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions, and in the coming age life eternal.",
    "Mark 10:31": "But many first shall be last, and the last first.",
    "Mark 10:32": "And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going on before them; and they were amazed, and were afraid as they followed. And taking the twelve again to [him], he began to tell them what was going to happen to him:",
    "Mark 10:33": "Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be delivered up to the chief priests and to the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him up to the nations:",

    "Mark 10:38": "And Jesus said to them, Ye do not know what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup which I drink, or be baptised with the baptism that I am baptised with?",
    "Mark 10:39": "And they said to him, We are able. And Jesus said to them, The cup that I drink ye will drink and with the baptism that I am baptised with ye will be baptised,",
    "Mark 10:40": "but to sit on my right hand or on my left is not mine to give, but for those for whom it is prepared.",
    "Mark 10:41": "And the ten having heard [of it], began to be indignant about James and John.",
    "Mark 10:42": "But Jesus having called them to [him], says to them, Ye know that those who are esteemed to rule over the nations exercise lordship over them; and their great men exercise authority over them;",

    "Mark 10:50": "And, throwing away his garment, he started up and came to Jesus.",
    "Mark 10:51": "And Jesus answering says to him, What wilt thou that I shall do to thee? And the blind [man] said to him, Rabboni, that I may see.",

    "Mark 11:6": "And they said to them as Jesus had commanded. And they let them [do it].",
    "Mark 11:7": "And they led the colt to Jesus, and cast their clothes upon it, and he sat on it;",
    "Mark 11:8": "and many strewed their clothes on the way, and others cut down branches from the trees [and went on strewing them on the way].",
    "Mark 11:9": "And those going on before and those following cried out, Hosanna! blessed [be] he that comes in [the] Lord’s name.",
    "Mark 11:10": "Blessed [be] the coming kingdom of our father David. Hosanna in the highest!",
    "Mark 11:11": "And he entered into Jerusalem and into the temple; and having looked round on all things, the hour being already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.",
    "Mark 11:12": "And on the morrow, when they were gone out of Bethany, he hungered.",
    "Mark 11:13": "And seeing from afar off a fig-tree which had leaves, he came, if perhaps he might find something on it. And having come up to it he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the time of figs.",
    "Mark 11:14": "And answering he said to it, Let no one eat fruit of thee any more for ever. And his disciples heard [it].",
    "Mark 11:15": "And they come to Jerusalem, and entering into the temple, he began to cast out those who sold and who bought in the temple, and he overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of the dove-sellers,",
    "Mark 11:16": "and suffered not that any one should carry any package through the temple.",

    "Mark 11:20": "And passing by early in the morning they saw the fig-tree dried up from the roots.",
    "Mark 11:21": "And Peter, remembering [what Jesus had said], says to him, Rabbi, see, the fig-tree which thou cursedst is dried up.",
    "Mark 11:22": "And Jesus answering says to them, Have faith in God.",
    "Mark 11:23": "Verily I say to you, that whosoever shall say to this mountain, Be thou taken away and cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but believe that what he says takes place, whatever he shall say shall come to pass for him.",
    "Mark 11:24": "For this reason I say to you, All things whatsoever ye pray for and ask, believe that ye receive it, and it shall come to pass for you.",
    "Mark 11:25": "And when ye stand praying, forgive if ye have anything against any one, that your Father also who is in the heavens may forgive you your offences.",

    "Mark 11:27": "And they come again to Jerusalem. And as he walked about in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders come to him,",
    "Mark 11:28": "and they say to him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority, that thou shouldest do these things?",
    "Mark 11:29": "And Jesus answering said to them, I also will ask you one thing, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things:",
    "Mark 11:30": "The baptism of John, was it of heaven, or of men? answer me.",
    "Mark 11:31": "And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we should say, Of heaven, he will say, Why [then] have ye not believed him?",
    "Mark 11:32": "but should we say, Of men—they feared the people; for all held of John that he was truly a prophet.",
    "Mark 11:33": "And they answering say to Jesus, We do not know. And Jesus [answering] says to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.",
    "Mark 12:1": "And he began to say to them in parables, A man planted a vineyard, and made a fence round [it] and dug a wine-vat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and left the country.",
    "Mark 12:2": "And he sent a bondman to the husbandmen at the season, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.",
    "Mark 12:3": "But they took him, and beat [him], and sent [him] away empty.",
    "Mark 12:4": "And again he sent to them another bondman; and [at] him they [threw stones, and] struck [him] on the head, and sent [him] away with insult.",
    "Mark 12:5": "And [again] he sent another, and him they killed; and many others, beating some and killing some.",

    "Mark 12:9": "What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others.",
    "Mark 12:10": "Have ye not even read this scripture, The stone which they that builded rejected, this has become the corner-stone:",
    "Mark 12:11": "this is of [the] Lord, and it is wonderful in our eyes?",
    "Mark 12:12": "And they sought to lay hold of him, and they feared the crowd; for they knew that he had spoken the parable of them. And they left him and went away.",
    "Mark 12:13": "And they send to him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that they might catch him in speaking.",
    "Mark 12:14": "And they come and say to him, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and carest not for any one; for thou regardest not men’s person, but teachest the way of God with truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not?",
    "Mark 12:15": "Should we give, or should we not give? But he knowing their hypocrisy said unto them, Why tempt ye me? Bring me a denarius that I may see [it].",
    "Mark 12:16": "And they brought [it]. And he says to them, Whose [is] this image and superscription? And they said to him, Caesar’s.",
    "Mark 12:17": "And Jesus answering said to them, Pay what is Caesar’s to Caesar, and what is God’s to God. And they wondered at him.",
    "Mark 12:18": "And Sadducees come to him, that say there is no resurrection; and they demanded of him saying,",
    "Mark 12:19": "Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if any one’s brother die, and leave a wife behind, and leave no children, that his brother shall take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.",
    "Mark 12:20": "There were seven brethren; and the first took a wife, and dying did not leave seed;",
    "Mark 12:21": "and the second took her and died, and neither did he leave seed; and the third likewise.",
    "Mark 12:22": "And the seven [took her and] did not leave seed. Last of all the woman also died.",
    "Mark 12:23": "In the resurrection, when they shall rise again, of which of them shall she be wife, for the seven had her as wife?",
    "Mark 12:24": "And Jesus answering said to them, Do not ye therefore err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God?",
    "Mark 12:25": "For when they rise from among [the] dead they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as angels [who are] in the heavens.",
    "Mark 12:26": "But concerning the dead that they rise, have ye not read in the book of Moses, in [the section of] the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, I [am] the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?",
    "Mark 12:27": "He is not the God of [the] dead, but of [the] living. Ye therefore greatly err.",
    "Mark 12:28": "And one of the scribes who had come up, and had heard them reasoning together, perceiving that he had answered them well, demanded of him, Which is [the] first commandment of all?",
    "Mark 12:29": "And Jesus answered him, [The] first commandment of all [is], Hear, Israel: the Lord our God is one Lord;",
    "Mark 12:30": "and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thine understanding, and with all thy strength. This is [the] first commandment.",
    "Mark 12:31": "And a second like it [is] this: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is not another commandment greater than these.",
    "Mark 12:32": "And the scribe said to him, Right, teacher; thou hast spoken according to [the] truth. For he is one, and there is none other besides him;",
    "Mark 12:33": "and to love him with all the heart, and with all the intelligence, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love one’s neighbour as one’s self, is more than all the burnt-offerings and sacrifices.",
    "Mark 12:34": "And Jesus, seeing that he had answered intelligently, said to him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no one dared question him any more.",
    "Mark 12:35": "And Jesus answering said [as he was] teaching in the temple, How do the scribes say that the Christ is son of David?",
    "Mark 12:36": "[for] David himself said [speaking] in the Holy Spirit, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand until I put thine enemies [as] footstool of thy feet.",
    "Mark 12:37": "David himself [therefore] calls him Lord, and whence is he his son? And the mass of the people heard him gladly.",
    "Mark 12:38": "And he said to them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, who like to walk about in long robes, and salutations in the marketplaces,",
    "Mark 12:39": "and first seats in the synagogues, and first places at suppers;",
    "Mark 12:40": "who devour the houses of widows, and as a pretext make long prayers. These shall receive a severer judgment.",
    "Mark 12:41": "And Jesus, having sat down opposite the treasury, saw how the crowd was casting money into the treasury; and many rich cast in much.",
    "Mark 12:42": "And a poor widow came and cast in two mites, which is a farthing.",
    "Mark 12:43": "And having called his disciples to [him] he said to them, Verily I say unto you, This poor widow has cast in more than all who have cast into the treasury:",
    "Mark 12:44": "for all have cast in of that which they had in abundance, but she of her destitution has cast in all that she had, the whole of her living.",
    "Mark 13:1": "And as he was going out of the temple, one of his disciples says to him, Teacher, see what stones and what buildings!",
    "Mark 13:2": "And Jesus answering said to him, Seest thou these great buildings? not a stone shall be left upon a stone, which shall not be thrown down.",
    "Mark 13:3": "And as he sat on the mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,",
    "Mark 13:4": "Tell us, when shall these things be, and what is the sign when all these things are going to be fulfilled?",
    "Mark 13:5": "And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any one mislead you.",
    "Mark 13:6": "For many shall come in my name, saying, It is I, and shall mislead many.",
    "Mark 13:7": "But when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be not disturbed, for [this] must happen, but the end is not yet.",
    "Mark 13:8": "For nation shall rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be earthquakes in [different] places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these things [are the] beginnings of throes.",
    "Mark 13:9": "But ye, take heed to yourselves, for they shall deliver you up to sanhedrims and to synagogues: ye shall be beaten and brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them;",
    "Mark 13:10": "and the gospel must first be preached to all the nations.",
    "Mark 13:11": "But when they shall lead you away to deliver you up, be not careful beforehand as to what ye shall say, [nor prepare your discourse]: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak; for ye are not the speakers, but the Holy Spirit.",
    "Mark 13:12": "But brother shall deliver up brother to death, and father child; and children shall rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.",
    "Mark 13:13": "And ye will be hated of all on account of my name; but he that has endured to the end, he shall be saved.",
    "Mark 13:14": "But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not, (he that reads let him consider [it],) then let those in Judaea flee to the mountains;",
    "Mark 13:15": "and him that is upon the housetop not come down into the house, nor enter [into it] to take away anything out of his house;",
    "Mark 13:16": "and him that is in the field not return back to take his garment.",
    "Mark 13:17": "But woe to those that are with child and to those that give suck in those days!",
    "Mark 13:18": "And pray that it may not be in winter time;",
    "Mark 13:19": "for those days shall be distress such as there has not been the like since [the] beginning of creation which God created, until now, and never shall be;",
    "Mark 13:20": "and if [the] Lord had not cut short those days, no flesh should have been saved; but on account of the elect whom he has chosen, he has cut short those days.",
    "Mark 13:21": "And then if any one say to you, Lo, here [is] the Christ, or Lo, there, believe [it] not.",
    "Mark 13:22": "For false Christs and false prophets will arise, and give signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.",
    "Mark 13:23": "But do ye take heed: behold, I have told you all things beforehand.",
    "Mark 13:24": "But in those days, after that distress, the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give its light;",
    "Mark 13:25": "and the stars of heaven shall be falling down, and the powers which are in the heavens shall be shaken;",
    "Mark 13:26": "and then shall they see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory;",
    "Mark 13:27": "and then shall he send his angels and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from end of earth to end of heaven.",
    "Mark 13:28": "But learn the parable from the fig-tree: when its branch already becomes tender and puts forth the leaves, ye know that the summer is near.",
    "Mark 13:29": "Thus also ye, when ye see these things happening, know that it is near, at the doors.",
    "Mark 13:30": "Verily I say unto you, This generation shall in no wise pass away, till all these things take place.",
    "Mark 13:31": "The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but my words shall in no wise pass away.",
    "Mark 13:32": "But of that day or of that hour no one knows, neither the angels who are in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father.",
    "Mark 13:33": "Take heed, watch and pray, for ye do not know when the time is:",
    "Mark 13:34": "[it is] as a man gone out of the country, having left his house and given to his bondmen the authority, and to each one his work, and commanded the doorkeeper that he should watch.",
    "Mark 13:35": "Watch therefore, for ye do not know when the master of the house comes: evening, or midnight, or cock-crow, or morning;",
    "Mark 13:36": "lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.",
    "Mark 13:37": "But what I say to you, I say to all, Watch.",
    "Mark 14:1": "Now the passover and the [feast of] unleavened bread was after two days. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might seize him by subtlety and kill him.",
    "Mark 14:2": "For they said, Not in the feast, lest perhaps there be a tumult of the people.",
    "Mark 14:3": "And when he was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he lay at table, there came a woman having an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard, very costly; and having broken the alabaster flask, she poured it out upon his head.",
    "Mark 14:4": "And there were some indignant in themselves, and saying, Why has this waste been made of the ointment?",
    "Mark 14:5": "for this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor. And they spoke very angrily at her.",
    "Mark 14:6": "But Jesus said, Let her alone; why do ye trouble her? she has wrought a good work as to me;",
    "Mark 14:7": "for ye have the poor always with you, and whenever ye would ye can do them good; but me ye have not always.",
    "Mark 14:8": "What she could she has done. She has beforehand anointed my body for the burial.",
    "Mark 14:9": "And verily I say unto you, Wheresoever these glad tidings may be preached in the whole world, what this [woman] has done shall be also spoken of for a memorial of her.",
    "Mark 14:10": "And Judas Iscariote, one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests that he might deliver him up to them;",
    "Mark 14:11": "and they, when they heard it, rejoiced, and promised him to give money. And he sought how he could opportunely deliver him up.",
    "Mark 14:12": "And the first day of unleavened bread, when they slew the passover, his disciples say to him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare, that thou mayest eat the passover?",
    "Mark 14:13": "And he sends two of his disciples, and says to them, Go into the city, and a man shall meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him.",
    "Mark 14:14": "And wheresoever he enters, say to the master of the house, The Teacher says, Where is my guest-chamber where I may eat the passover with my disciples?",
    "Mark 14:15": "and he will shew you a large upper room furnished ready. There make ready for us.",
    "Mark 14:16": "And his disciples went away and came into the city, and found as he had said to them; and they made ready the passover.",
    "Mark 14:17": "And when evening was come, he comes with the twelve.",
    "Mark 14:18": "And as they lay at table and were eating, Jesus said, Verily I say to you, One of you shall deliver me up; he who is eating with me.",
    "Mark 14:19": "And they began to be grieved, and to say to him, one by one, Is it I? [and another, Is it I?]",
    "Mark 14:20": "But he answered and said to them, One of the twelve, he who dips with me in the dish.",
    "Mark 14:21": "The Son of man goes indeed as it is written concerning him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is delivered up; [it were] good for that man if he had not been born.",
    "Mark 14:22": "And as they were eating, Jesus, having taken bread, when he had blessed, broke [it], and gave [it] to them, and said, Take [this]: this is my body.",
    "Mark 14:23": "And having taken [the] cup, when he had given thanks, he gave [it] to them, and they all drank out of it.",
    "Mark 14:24": "And he said to them, This is my blood, that of the [new] covenant, that shed for many.",
    "Mark 14:25": "Verily I say to you, I will no more drink at all of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.",
    "Mark 14:26": "And having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.",
    "Mark 14:27": "And Jesus says to them, All ye shall be offended, for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered abroad.",
    "Mark 14:28": "But after I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.",
    "Mark 14:29": "But Peter said to him, Even if all should be offended, yet not I.",
    "Mark 14:30": "And Jesus says to him, Verily I say to thee, that thou to-day, in this night, before [the] cock shall crow twice, thou shalt thrice deny me.",
    "Mark 14:31": "But he said [so much] exceedingly the more, If I should have to die with thee, I will in no wise deny thee. And likewise said they all too.",
    "Mark 14:32": "And they come to a place of which the name [is] Gethsemane, and he says to his disciples, Sit here while I shall pray.",
    "Mark 14:33": "And he takes with him Peter and James and John, and he began to be amazed and oppressed in spirit.",
    "Mark 14:34": "And he says to them, My soul is full of grief even unto death; abide here and watch.",
    "Mark 14:35": "And, going forward a little, he fell upon the earth; and he prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him.",
    "Mark 14:36": "And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee: take away this cup from me; but not what I will, but what thou [wilt].",
    "Mark 14:37": "And he comes and finds them sleeping. And he says to Peter, Simon, dost thou sleep? Hast thou not been able to watch one hour?",
    "Mark 14:38": "Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed [is] willing, but the flesh weak.",
    "Mark 14:39": "And going away, he prayed again, saying the same thing.",
    "Mark 14:40": "And returning, he found them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy; and they knew not what they should answer him.",
    "Mark 14:41": "And he comes the third time and says to them, Sleep on now, and take your rest. It is enough; the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is delivered up into the hands of sinners.",
    "Mark 14:42": "Arise, let us go; behold, he that delivers me up has drawn nigh.",
    "Mark 14:43": "And immediately, while he was yet speaking, Judas comes up, [being] one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd, with swords and sticks, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.",
    "Mark 14:44": "Now he that delivered him up had given them a sign between them, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he; seize him, and lead [him] away safely.",
    "Mark 14:45": "And being come, straightway coming up to him, he says, Rabbi, Rabbi; and he covered him with kisses.",
    "Mark 14:46": "And they laid their hands upon him and seized him.",
    "Mark 14:47": "But a certain one of those who stood by, having drawn his sword, struck the bondman of the high priest, and took off his ear.",
    "Mark 14:48": "And Jesus answering said to them, Are ye come out as against a robber, with swords and sticks to take me?",
    "Mark 14:49": "I was daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye did not seize me; but [it is] that the scriptures may be fulfilled.",
    "Mark 14:50": "And all left him and fled.",
    "Mark 14:51": "And a certain young man followed him with a linen cloth cast about his naked [body]; and [the young men] seize him;",
    "Mark 14:52": "but he, leaving the linen cloth behind [him], fled from them naked.",
    "Mark 14:53": "And they led away Jesus to the high priest. And there come together to him all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.",
    "Mark 14:54": "And Peter followed him at a distance, till [he was] within the court of the high priest’s palace; and he was sitting with the officers and warming himself in the light [of the fire].",
    "Mark 14:55": "And the chief priests and the whole sanhedrim sought testimony against Jesus to cause him to be put to death, and did not find [any].",
    "Mark 14:56": "For many bore false witness against him, and their testimony did not agree.",
    "Mark 14:57": "And certain persons rose up and bore false witness against him, saying,",
    "Mark 14:58": "We heard him saying, I will destroy this temple which is made with hands, and in the course of three days I will build another not made with hands.",
    "Mark 14:59": "And neither thus did their testimony agree.",
    "Mark 14:60": "And the high priest, rising up before them all, asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? What do these testify against thee?",
    "Mark 14:61": "But he was silent, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and says to him, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?",

    "Mark 14:69": "And the maid, seeing him, again began to say to those that stood by, This is [one] of them.",
    "Mark 14:70": "And he again denied. And again, after a little, those that stood by said to Peter, Truly thou art [one] of them, for also thou art a Galilean.",
    "Mark 14:71": "But he began to curse and to swear, I know not this man of whom ye speak.",
    "Mark 14:72": "And the second time a cock crew. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus said to him, Before [the] cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice; and when he thought thereon he wept.",

    "Mark 15:3": "And the chief priests accused him urgently.",
    "Mark 15:4": "And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? See of how many things they bear witness against thee.",
    "Mark 15:5": "But Jesus still answered nothing, so that Pilate marvelled.",
    "Mark 15:6": "But at [the] feast he released to them one prisoner, whomsoever they begged [of him].",
    "Mark 15:7": "Now there was the [person] named Barabbas bound with those who had made insurrection with [him], [and] that had committed murder in the insurrection.",
    "Mark 15:8": "And the crowd crying out began to beg [that he would do] to them as he had always done.",
