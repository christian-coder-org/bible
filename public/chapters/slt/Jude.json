    "Mark 7:17": "And when he came into the house from the crowd, his disciples asked him of the parable.",
    "Mark 7:18": "And he says, So are ye also without understanding? Do ye not perceive, that anything from without entering into a man, cannot pollute him.",
    "Mark 7:19": "For it goes not into the heart, but into the belly, and goes forth into the privy, purging all food.",
    "Mark 7:20": "And he said, That going out of a man, that pollutes a man.",
    "Mark 7:21": "For within, out of the heart of men, go forth evil reflections, adulteries, fornications, murders,",
    "Mark 7:22": "Thefts, overreaching, deceit, licentiousness, an evil eye, defamation, pride, foolishness:",
    "Mark 7:23": "All these evils go out from within, and pollute a man.",
    "Mark 7:24": "And arising from thence, he departed into the bounds of Tyre and Sidon, and having come into the house, he would have none know; and he could not be hid.",
    "Mark 7:25": "For a woman having heard of him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, having come, fell at his feet:",
    "Mark 7:26": "And the woman was a Grecian, a Syrophenician by birth; and she entreated him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.",
    "Mark 7:27": "And Jesus said to her, Permit the children first to be satisfied; for it is not good to take the children’s bread, and cast to little dogs.",
    "Mark 7:28": "And she answered and says to him, Yes, Lord: for also the little dogs under the table eat from the children’s crumbs.",
    "Mark 7:29": "And he said to her, For this word retire; the demon has gone out of thy daughter.",
    "Mark 7:30": "And having departed to her house, she found the demon gone forth, and the daughter cast upon the bed.",
    "Mark 7:31": "And again, having gone out from the bounds of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, in the midst of the bounds of Decapolis.",
    "Mark 7:32": "And they bring to him a deaf one, tongue-tied; and they beseech him that he would put the hand upon him.",
    "Mark 7:33": "And having taken him away from the crowd apart, he put his fingers in his ears, and having spit, he touched his tongue;",
    "Mark 7:34": "And having looked up to heaven, he sighed, and says to him, Ephphatha, which is, Be opened.",
    "Mark 7:35": "And quickly his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake rightly.",
    "Mark 7:36": "And he charged them that they should say to none: and as much as he charged them, they proclaimed more abundantly;",
    "Mark 7:37": "And above measure were they struck with amazement, saying, Well has he done all things: he makes the deaf to hear, and the speechless to speak.",
    "Mark 8:1": "In those days the crowd being very many, and having nothing they might eat, Jesus having called his disciples, says to them,",
    "Mark 8:2": "I feel compassion for the crowd, for already they remain three days with me, and have nothing they might eat:",
    "Mark 8:3": "And if I loose them fasting to their house, they will be relaxed in the way: for some of them have come from far.",
    "Mark 8:4": "And his disciples answered him, Whence might anyone be able to satisfy these with loaves here in the lonely place?",
    "Mark 8:5": "And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.",
    "Mark 8:6": "And he enjoined to the crowd to recline upon the earth: and having taken the seven loaves, having returned thanks, he brake, and he gave to his disciples that they might set before; and they set before the crowd.",
    "Mark 8:7": "And they had a few little fishes: and having praised, he spake to set them also before.",
    "Mark 8:8": "And they ate, and were satisfied: and they took up the remains of the fragments, seven wicker baskets.",
    "Mark 8:9": "And they eating were about four thousand: and he loosed them.",
    "Mark 8:10": "And quickly having gone into the ship with his disciples, he came into the parts of Dalmanutha.",
    "Mark 8:11": "And the Pharisees came out, and began to search out with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.",
    "Mark 8:12": "And having sighed deeply in spirit, he says, Why seeks this generation for a sign Verily I say to you, shall a sign be given to this generation.",
    "Mark 8:13": "And having let them go, having gone again into the ship, he departed beyond.",
    "Mark 8:14": "And they forgot to take loaves, and had not but one loaf with them in the ship.",
    "Mark 8:15": "And he enjoined them, saying, See ye, look away from the leaven of the Pharisees, and the leaven of Herod.",
    "Mark 8:16": "And they reasoned with one another, saying, Because we have no loaves.",
    "Mark 8:17": "And Jesus having known, says to them, Why reason ye with yourselves, because ye have no loaves? observe ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?",
    "Mark 8:18": "Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and remember ye not?",
    "Mark 8:19": "When I brake the five loaves to five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say to him, Twelve.",
    "Mark 8:20": "And when the seven to four thousand, the fillings of how many baskets of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.",
    "Mark 8:21": "And he said to them, How do ye not understand.",
    "Mark 8:22": "And he comes to Bethsaida; and they bring to him one blind, and beseech him that he would touch him.",
    "Mark 8:23": "And having taken the hand of the blind, he led him forth without the town; and having spit into his eyes, having put hands upon him, he asked him if he saw any thing.",
    "Mark 8:24": "And having looked up, he said, I see men that I see as trees, walking.",
    "Mark 8:25": "Then again he put hands upon his eyes, and made him look up; and he was restored, and he saw all clearly.",
    "Mark 8:26": "And he sent him to his house, saying, Thou shouldest not either enter into the town, neither, say to any in the town.",
    "Mark 8:27": "And Jesus went out, and his disciples, to the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and he asked his disciples in the way, saying to them, Whom do men say me to be?",
    "Mark 8:28": "And they answered, John the Immerser: and some, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.",
    "Mark 8:29": "And he says to them, And whom do ye say me to be? And Peter, having answered, says to him, Thou art Christ.",
    "Mark 8:30": "And he rebuked them, that they should say to none concerning him.",
    "Mark 8:31": "And he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be disapproved of by the elders, and the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise up.",
    "Mark 8:32": "And he spake the word with frankness. And Peter having taken him, began to rebuke him.",
    "Mark 8:33": "And he having turned back, and having seen his disciples, rebuked Peter, saying, Retire behind me, Satan: for thou hast not in mind the things of God, but the things of men.",
    "Mark 8:34": "And having called the crowd with his disciples, he said to them, Whoever wills to come after me, let him absolutely deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.",
    "Mark 8:35": "For whoever wills to save his life shall lose it; and whoever should lose his life for my sake and the good news, the same shall save it.",
    "Mark 8:36": "For what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and injure his soul.",
    "Mark 8:37": "Or what shall a man give for the exchange of his soul?",
    "Mark 8:38": "For whoever should be ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; also the Son of man shall be ashamed of him, when he should come in the glory of the Father with the holy messengers.",
    "Mark 9:1": "And he said to them, Truly I say to you, That some of those are standing here, who should not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God having come in power.",
    "Mark 9:2": "And after six days Jesus takes Peter, and James, and John, and brings them up into a high mountain apart alone: and he was transformed before them.",
    "Mark 9:3": "And his garments were shining, exceeding white, such as no fuller on earth can make white.",
    "Mark 9:4": "And Elias was seen to them, with Moses: and they were speaking together with Jesus.",
    "Mark 9:5": "And Peter having answered, says to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tents; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.",
    "Mark 9:6": "For he knew not what he said; for they were terrified.",
    "Mark 9:7": "And a cloud was overshadowing them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my dearly beloved Son: hear ye him.",
    "Mark 9:8": "And suddenly, having looked around, they no more saw any one, but Jesus alone with them.",
    "Mark 9:9": "And they coming down from the mount, he charged them that they recount to none what they saw, except when the Son of man should arise from the dead.",
    "Mark 9:10": "And they held the word firmly to themselves, searching out together what it is to arise from the dead.",
    "Mark 9:11": "And having asked him, saying, That the scribes say that Elias must first come.",
    "Mark 9:12": "And he having answered, said to them, Elias truly having first come, restores all things; and how it has been written of the Son of man, that he suffer many things; and be set at nought.",
    "Mark 9:13": "But I say to you, that Elias also has come, and they did to him whatever they would, as it has been written of him.",
    "Mark 9:14": "And having come to the disciples, he saw a great crowd about them, and the scribes seeking out with them.",
    "Mark 9:15": "And immediately all the crowd; having seen him, were amazed, and running near greeted him.",
    "Mark 9:16": "And he asked the scribes, What seek ye together with them?",
    "Mark 9:17": "And one from the crowd having answered, said, Teacher, I have brought my son to thee, having a speechless spirit.",
    "Mark 9:18": "And wherever he overtakes him, he rends him: and he foams, and gnashes his teeth, and he is dried up: and I spake to thy disciples that they might cast him out; and they could not.",
    "Mark 9:19": "And he having answered, says to him, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you how long shall I bear with you? bring him to me.",
    "Mark 9:20": "And they brought him to him: and having seen him, quickly the spirit rent him; and having fallen upon the earth, foaming he rolled himself about.",
    "Mark 9:21": "And he asked his father, How long is it that this has been to him? And he said, From childhood.",
    "Mark 9:22": "And many times also it cast him into fire, and into water, that it might destroy him; but if thou canst anything, help us, having had compassion upon us.",
    "Mark 9:23": "And Jesus said to him, If thou canst believe, all things possible to him believing.",
    "Mark 9:24": "And quickly the child’s father having cried out with tears, said, I believe, O Lord, help thou mine unbelief.",
    "Mark 9:25": "And Jesus, having seen that the crowd ran together, rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, Speechless and deaf spirit, I command thee to come out of him, and that thou come no more into him.",
    "Mark 9:26": "And having cried and rent him much, it came forth, and he was as dead; so that many said, That he is dead.",
    "Mark 9:27": "And Jesus having held him by the hand, raised him; and he stood up.",
    "Mark 9:28": "And he having come into the house, his disciples asked him apart, Wherefore were we not able to cast him forth?",
    "Mark 9:29": "And he said to them, This kind can go, out by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.",
    "Mark 9:30": "And having come out thence they passed through Galilee; and he desired not that any one should know.",
    "Mark 9:31": "For he taught his disciples, and said to them, That the Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and having been killed, he shall raise himself the third day.",
    "Mark 9:32": "And they knew not the word, and were afraid to ask him.",
    "Mark 9:33": "And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What reasoned ye to yourselves in the way.",
    "Mark 9:34": "And they were silent; for they discussed to one another in the way, who the greatest.",
    "Mark 9:35": "And having sat down, he called the twelve, and says to them, If any wish to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.",
    "Mark 9:36": "And having taken a young child, he set him in the midst of them: and having taken it up in his arms, he said to them,",
    "Mark 9:37": "Whoever should receive ones of such young children in my name, receives me: and whoever should receive me, receives not me, but him sending me.",
    "Mark 9:38": "And John answered him, saying, Teacher, we saw a certain one casting out demons in thy name, who follows not us: and we checked him, for he follows not us.",
    "Mark 9:39": "And Jesus said, Check him not: for there is no one who shall do power in my name, and shall be able quickly to revile me.",
    "Mark 9:40": "For whoever is not against us, is for us.",
    "Mark 9:41": "For whoever should give you to drink a cup of water in my name, because ye are of Christ, verily I say to you, he should not lose his reward.",
    "Mark 9:42": "And whoever should scandalize one of these little ones believing in me, it is good for him rather if a millstone is put about his neck, and he be cast into the sea.",
    "Mark 9:43": "And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off; it is good for thee rather to enter into life maimed, than having two hands, to go away into hell, into inextinguishable fire:",
    "Mark 9:44": "Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.",
    "Mark 9:45": "And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life lame, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into inextinguishable fire:",
    "Mark 9:46": "Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.",
    "Mark 9:47": "And if thine eye offend thee, cast it out: it is good for thee, one-eyed, to come into the kingdom of God, than having two eyes to be cast into a hell of fire:",
    "Mark 9:48": "Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.",
    "Mark 9:49": "For all shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.",
    "Mark 9:50": "Salt good: but if the salt be saltless, with what will ye prepare it? Have salt in yourselves, and live in peace one with another.",
    "Mark 10:1": "And having risen from thence, he comes into the bounds of Judea, through the other side of Jordan: and crowds came together again to him; and, as he was accustomed, again he taught them.",

    "Mark 10:3": "And he, having answered, said to them, What did Moses command you?",
    "Mark 10:4": "And they said, Moses permitted to write a bill of divorce, and to loose.",
    "Mark 10:5": "And Jesus, having answered, said to them, For your hard heart he wrote you this command.",
    "Mark 10:6": "And from the beginning of creation God made them male and female.",
    "Mark 10:7": "For this will a man leave his father and mother, and be attached to his wife;",
    "Mark 10:8": "And they two shall be in one flesh: so that they are no more two, but one flesh.",
    "Mark 10:9": "What therefore God yoked together, let not man separate.",
    "Mark 10:10": "And again in the house, his disciples asked him of the same.",

    "Mark 10:15": "Truly I say to you, Whoever should not receive the kingdom of God as a young child, should not come into it.",
    "Mark 10:16": "And having taken them up in his arms, having put the hands upon them, he praised them.",
    "Mark 10:17": "And he going in the way, one running and having fallen upon his knees, asked him, Good teacher, What shall I do that I might inherit eternal life.",
    "Mark 10:18": "And Jesus said to him, Why sayest thou me good? none good, except the one God.",
    "Mark 10:19": "Thou knowest the commands: Thou shouldst not commit adultery; Thou shouldst not kill; Thou shouldst not steal; Thou shouldst not bear false testimony; Thou shouldst not defraud; Honour thy father and mother.",
    "Mark 10:20": "And he, having answered, said to him, O teacher, all these have I watched from my youth.",
    "Mark 10:21": "And Jesus having looked upon him, loved him, and said to him, One thing is wanting to thee retire; whatever thou hast, sell, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, having taken up the cross.",

    "John 4:46": "Then came Jesus again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain royal one, whose son was sick in Capernaum.",
    "John 4:47": "He, having heard that Jesus was come from Judea to Galilee, went away to him, and asked him that he would go down and heal his son: for he was about to die.",
    "John 4:48": "Then said Jesus to him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye would not believe.",
    "John 4:49": "The royal one says to Him, Lord, go down before my child dies.",
    "John 4:50": "Jesus says to him, Go; thy son lives. And the man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and he went.",
    "John 4:51": "And he already going down, his servants met him, and announced, saying, That thy child lives.",
    "John 4:52": "Then he inquired of them the hour in which he was attended to. And they said to him, That yesterday the seventh hour the fever left him.",

    "John 5:2": "And there is in Jerusalem, at the sheep place a pool, in Hebrew called Bethesda, having five porches.",
    "John 5:3": "In these lay a great multitude of weak, blind, lame, withered, expecting the moving of the water.",
    "John 5:4": "For a messenger at a time went down into the pool, and troubled the water: then he having first stepped in after the troubling of the water became healthy, by whatever malady a long while since he was laid.",
    "John 5:5": "And a certain man was there, being in weakness thirty-eight years.",
    "John 5:6": "Jesus having seen the same lying down, and having known that it was already much time, says to him, Wilt thou be well?",
    "John 5:7": "He being sick answered him, Lord, I have no man, that, when the water was troubled, he might cast me into the pool: and in which I am coming, another steps down before me.",
    "John 5:8": "Jesus says to him, Arise, take up thy couch, and walk.",
    "John 5:9": "And quickly the man was well, and he took up his couch, and walked: and the sabbath was in that day.",
    "John 5:10": "Then said the Jews to him healed, It is the sabbath: it is not lawful for thee to take up thy couch.",
    "John 5:11": "He answered them, He having made me well, the same said to me, Lift up thy couch, and walk.",
    "John 5:12": "Then they asked him, Who is the man having said to thee, Lift up thy couch, and walk?",
    "John 5:13": "And he healed knew not who he is: for Jesus escaped, a crowd being in the place.",
    "John 5:14": "After these, Jesus finds him in the temple, and he said to him, Behold, thou hast become well: sin no more, lest something worse be to thee.",
    "John 5:15": "The man departed, and announced to the Jews that it is Jesus having made him well.",
    "John 5:16": "And therefore the Jews drove out Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these in the sabbath.",
    "John 5:17": "And Jesus answered, My Father works till now, and I work.",
    "John 5:18": "For this therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, for not only did he loose the sabbath, but also he called God his own Father, making himself equal to God.",
    "John 5:19": "Then answered Jesus and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can of himself do nothing, except what he sees the Father doing: for whatever he should do, also these does the Son likewise.",
    "John 5:20": "For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all which himself does: and he will show him greater than these, that ye might wonder.",
    "John 5:21": "For as the Father arouses the dead, and makes alive; so also the Son makes alive whom he will.",
    "John 5:22": "For the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son:",
    "John 5:23": "That all should honour the Son, as they honour the Father. He honouring not the Son, honours not the Father having sent him.",
    "John 5:24": "Truly, truly, I say to you, That he hearing my word, and believing him having sent me, has eternal life, and comes not into judgment; but has passed from death to life.",
    "John 5:25": "Truly, truly, I say to you, That the hour comes, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they hearing shall live.",
    "John 5:26": "For as the Father has life in himself, so also gave he to the Son to have life in himself;",
    "John 5:27": "And gave him authority also to do judgment, because he is the Son of man.",
    "John 5:28": "Wonder not at this: for the hour comes, in which all they in the tombs shall hear his voice, and shall go forth;",
    "John 5:29": "They having done good, to rising up of life; and they having done bad, to rising up of judgment.",
    "John 5:30": "I can do nothing of myself: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; for I seek not my will, but the will of the Father having sent me.",
    "John 5:31": "If I testify of myself, my testimony is not true.",
    "John 5:32": "Another is testifying of me, and I know that the testimony which he testifies of me is true.",
    "John 5:33": "Ye have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.",
    "John 5:34": "But I receive not testimony from man: but these I say that ye might be saved.",
    "John 5:35": "He was a burning and manifest light: and ye wished to rejoice for a time in his light.",
    "John 5:36": "And I have greater testimony than of John: for the works that the Father gave me that I might finish them, the same works that I do, testify of me, that the Father has sent me.",
    "John 5:37": "And the Father having sent me, he has testified of me. Nor have ye at any time heard his voice, or seen his form.",
    "John 5:38": "And his word ye have not remaining in you: for whom he sent, him ye believe not.",
    "John 5:39": "Search the writings; for ye think in them to have eternal life: and these are they testifying of me.",
    "John 5:40": "And ye wish not to come to me, that ye might have life.",
    "John 5:41": "I receive not glory from man.",
    "John 5:42": "But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.",
    "John 5:43": "I have come in the name of my Father, and ye receive me not: if another should come in his own name, him will ye receive.",
    "John 5:44": "How can ye believe, receiving glory from one another, and ye seek not the glory that from God alone?",
    "John 5:45": "Think not that I shall accuse you to the Father: he accusing you is Moses, in whom ye have hoped.",
    "John 5:46": "For if ye had believed Moses, ye had believed me: for he himself wrote of me.",
    "John 5:47": "And if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?",
    "John 6:1": "After these Jesus departed beyond the sea of Galilee, of Tiberias.",
    "John 6:2": "And a great crowd followed him, for they saw his signs which he did upon the sick.",
    "John 6:3": "And Jesus went up into the mount, and sat there with his disciples.",
    "John 6:4": "And the pascha was near, the festival of the Jews.",
    "John 6:5": "Then Jesus having lifted up the eyes, and seen that a great crowd comes to him, says to Philip, Whence shall we buy loaves that these might eat?",
    "John 6:6": "And this he said trying him: for himself knew what he was about to do.",
    "John 6:7": "Philip answered him. Loaves of two hundred drachmas will not suffice them, that each of them should take some little.",
    "John 6:8": "One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, says to him,",
    "John 6:9": "There is one little boy here, who has five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are these among so many?",
    "John 6:10": "And Jesus said, Make the men recline. And there was much grass in the place. Then the men reclined, the number about five thousand.",
    "John 6:11": "And Jesus took the loaves; and having given thanks, distributed to his disciples, and the disciples to the reclining; and likewise of the small fishes, as many as they wished.",
    "John 6:12": "And when they were filled, he says to his disciples, Gather the fragments remaining over, that nothing should be lost.",
    "John 6:13": "Then gathered they, and filled twelve baskets of the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over to them having eaten.",
    "John 6:14": "Then the men, having seen the sign which Jesus did, said, That this is truly the prophet coming into the world.",
    "John 6:15": "Then Jesus having known that they were about to come and carry him of forcibly, that they might make him king, departed again to the mount alone.",
    "John 6:16": "And when it was evening, his disciples went down to the sea.",
    "John 6:17": "And having entered into a ship, they came beyond the sea to Capernaum. And already was there darkness, and Jesus had not come to them.",
    "John 6:18": "And the sea, a great wind blowing, arose.",
    "John 6:19": "Then having urged forward about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they behold Jesus walking upon the sea, and being near the ship: and they were afraid.",
    "John 6:20": "And he says to them, I am; be not afraid.",
    "John 6:21": "Then they wished to take him into the ship: and the ship was quickly at land to which they retired.",
    "John 6:22": "The morrow, the crowd standing beyond the sea having seen that no other small vessel was there, except that one into which his disciples had entered, and that Jesus entered not with his disciples into the small vessel, but his disciples departed alone;",
    "John 6:23": "(But also other small vessels came out of Tiberias near to the place where they ate bread, the Lord having returned thanks:)",
    "John 6:24": "When the crowd therefore saw that Jesus is not there, nor his disciples, they also entered into ships, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.",
    "John 6:25": "And having found them beyond the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when camest thou here?",
    "John 6:26": "Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but for that ye ate of the loaves, and were satisfied.",
    "John 6:27": "Work not for food perishing, but food remaining to eternal life, which the Son of man will give you: for him God the Father sealed.",
    "John 6:28": "Then said they to him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?",
    "John 6:29": "Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that ye should believe in him whom he has sent.",
    "John 6:30": "Then said they to him, What sign doest thou, that we might see, and believe thee? what workest thou?",
    "John 6:31": "Our fathers ate manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.",
    "John 6:32": "Then said Jesus to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses has not given you bread from heaven; but my Father gives you true bread from heaven.",
    "John 6:33": "For the bread of God is he coming down from heaven, and giving life to the world.",
    "John 6:34": "Then said they to him, Lord, always give us this bread.",
    "John 6:35": "And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he coming to me should not hunger; and he believing in me should not thirst.",
    "John 6:36": "But I said to you, That ye have seen me, and believe not.",
    "John 6:37": "All that the Father gives me shall come to me; and he coming to me I will not cast out.",
    "John 6:38": "For I have come down from heaven, not that I might do my will, but the will of him having sent me.",
    "John 6:39": "And this is the will of the Father having sent me, that all which he has given me, I should not loose of it, but raise it up in the last day.",
    "John 6:40": "And this is the will of him having sent me, that every one seeing the Son, and believing in him, should have eternal life: and I will raise him up at the last day.",
    "John 6:41": "Then murmured the Jews about him, because he said, I am the bread having come down from heaven.",
    "John 6:42": "And they said, Is not this Jesus, Joseph’s son, whose father and mother we know? how then says he, That I have come down from heaven?",
    "John 6:43": "Then answered Jesus and said to them, Murmur not with one another.",
    "John 6:44": "None can come to me, except the Father having sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.",
    "John 6:45": "It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every one therefore having heard and learned of the Father, comes to me.",
    "John 6:46": "Not that any one has seen the Father, except he being from God, he has seen the Father.",
    "John 6:47": "Truly, truly, I say to you, he believing in me has eternal life.",
    "John 6:48": "I am the bread of life.",
    "John 6:49": "Your fathers ate manna in the desert, and died.",
    "John 6:50": "This is the bread which coming down from heaven, that whoever should eat of it, and he should not die.",
    "John 6:51": "I am the living bread which having come down from heaven: if any one eat of this bread, he shall live forever: and also the bread which I shall give is my flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world.",
    "John 6:52": "Then the Jews contended with one another, saying, How can he give us the flesh to eat.",
    "John 6:53": "Then said Jesus to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in yourselves.",
    "John 6:54": "He chewing my flesh, and drinking my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.",
    "John 6:55": "For my flesh is truly food, and my blood is truly drink.",
    "John 6:56": "He chewing my flesh, and drinking my blood, remains in me, and I in him.",
    "John 6:57": "As the living Father sent me, and I live through the Father: also he chewing me, the same also shall live through me.",
    "John 6:58": "This is the bread which having come down from heaven: not as your fathers ate manna, and died: he chewing this bread shall live forever.",
    "John 6:59": "He said these, teaching in the synagogue, in Capernaum.",
    "John 6:60": "Then many of his disciples, having heard, said, This is a hard word; who can hear it.",
    "John 6:61": "And Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmur for this, said to them, Does this offend you?",
    "John 6:62": "If then ye see the Son of man going up where he was before.",
    "John 6:63": "It is the spirit making alive; the flesh profits nothing: the words which I speak to you are spirit, and are life.",
    "John 6:64": "But there are some of you who believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they are not believing, and who he is going to deliver him up.",
    "John 6:65": "And he said, Therefore have I said to you, that no one can come to me, except it be given him of my Father.",
    "John 6:66": "From this many of his disciples went away back, and walked no more with him.",
    "John 6:67": "Then said Jesus to the twelve, And ye will not go away?",
    "John 6:68": "Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go away? thou hast the words of eternal life.",
    "John 6:69": "And we have believed, and known, that thou art Christ, Son of the living God.",
    "John 6:70": "Jesus answered them, Have I not chosen you twelve, and of you one is a devil?",
    "John 6:71": "And he spake of Judas Iscariot, of Simon: for he was about to deliver him up, being one of the twelve.",
    "John 7:1": "And Jesus walked after these in Galilee: for he wished not to walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.",
    "John 7:2": "And the festival of the Jews was near, the Pitching of tents.",
    "John 7:3": "Then said his brethren to him, Go away thence, and retire to Judea, that also thy disciples might see thy works which thou doest.",
    "John 7:4": "For none does any thing in secret, and seeks himself to be in freedom of speech. If thou do these, make thyself manifest to the world.",
    "John 7:5": "For neither believed his brethren in him.",
    "John 7:6": "Then says Jesus to them, My time is not yet present: and your time is always ready.",
    "John 7:7": "The world cannot hate you: but me it hates, for I testify of it, that its works are evil.",
    "John 7:8": "Go ye up to this festival: I go not yet up to the festival; for my time has not yet been completed.",
    "John 7:9": "And speaking to them these things, he remained in Galilee.",
    "John 7:10": "And when his brethren went up, then he went up to the festival, not openly, but as in secret.",
    "John 7:11": "Then the Jews sought him in the festival, and said, Where is he.",
    "John 7:12": "And much murmuring was for him in the crowds: some truly said, That he is good: and others said, No; but he deceives the crowd.",
    "John 7:13": "However none spake of him with freedom of speech, for fear of the Jews.",
    "John 7:14": "And now the festival being in the midst, Jesus went up to the temple, and taught.",
    "John 7:15": "And the Jews wondered, saying, How knows he letters, not having learned.",
    "John 7:16": "Jesus answered them, and said, My teaching is not mine, but his having sent me.",
    "John 7:17": "If any desire to do his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or I speak from myself.",
    "John 7:18": "He speaking from himself, seeks his own glory: but he seeking the glory of him having sent him, he is true, and no injustice is in him.",
    "John 7:19": "Has not Moses given you the law, and none of you does the law? Why seek ye to kill me?",
    "John 7:20": "The crowd answered and said, Thou hast a demon: who seeks to kill thee?",
    "John 7:21": "Jesus answered and said to them, I did one work, and ye all marvel for this.",
    "John 7:22": "Moses has given you circumcision; (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and in the sabbath ye circumcise a man.",
    "John 7:23": "If a man receive circumcision in the sabbath, that the law of Moses be not loosed; rage not at me, because I made a man wholly well on the Sabbath.",
    "John 7:24": "Judge not according to sight, but judge just judgment.",
    "John 7:25": "Then said some of the Jerusalemites, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?",
    "John 7:26": "And, behold, he speaks in freedom of speech, and they say nothing to him. Not at any time knew the rulers truly, that this is truly Christ?",
    "John 7:27": "But we know this whence he is: and Christ, when he should come, none knows whence he is.",
    "John 7:28": "Then cried Jesus in the temple, teaching, and saying, And ye know me, and ye know whence I am: and I have not come of myself, but he having sent me is true, whom ye know not.",
    "John 7:29": "But I know him; for I am from him, and he sent me.",
    "John 7:30": "Then sought they to seize him: and none put the hand upon him, for his hour had not yet come.",
    "John 7:31": "And many of the crowd believed on him, and said, That Christ, when he should come, will he do more signs than these which he did?",
    "John 7:32": "The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things of him; and the Pharisees and chief priests sent servants that they might seize him.",
    "John 7:33": "Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little time am I with you, and I retire to him having sent me.",
    "John 7:34": "And ye shall seek me and shall not find: and where I am, ye cannot come.",
    "John 7:35": "Then said the Jews among themselves, Where is he about to go, that we shall not find him? is he not about to go to the dispersion of the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?",
    "John 7:36": "What is the word which he spake, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find: and where I am, ye cannot come?",
    "John 7:37": "In the last day, the great one of the festival, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any thirst, let him come to me, and drink.",
    "John 7:38": "He believing in me, as said the writing, from his belly shall flow rivers of living waters.",
    "John 7:39": "(This spake he of the Spirit which they believing in him were about to receive: for the Holy Spirit was not yet; for Jesus was not yet honoured.)",
    "John 7:40": "Then many of the crowd, having heard the word, said, This is truly a prophet.",
    "John 7:41": "Others said, This is Christ: and others said, Yet Christ comes not out of Galilee.",
    "John 7:42": "Said not the writing, That of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the town where David was, Christ comes?",
    "John 7:43": "Then was there a division in the crowd on his account.",
    "John 7:44": "And some of them wished to seize him; but none put hands upon him.",
    "John 7:45": "Then came the servants to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why did ye not bring him.",
    "John 7:46": "And the servants answered, Never spake man as this man.",
    "John 7:47": "Then the Pharisees answered them, Have ye not also been deceived.",
    "John 7:48": "Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?",
    "John 7:49": "But the crowd, not knowing the law, are cursed.",
    "John 7:50": "Nicodemus says to them, (he having come to him by night, being one of them,)",
    "John 7:51": "Our law judges not a man, except it first hear from him, and know what he does.",
    "John 7:52": "They answered and said to him, And art thou not of Galilee? Search, and see: for a prophet has not risen out of Galilee.",
    "John 7:53": "And each man went to his house.",
    "John 8:1": "And Jesus went to the mount of Olives.",
    "John 8:2": "And again in the morning he was present in the temple, and all the people came to him; and having sat down, he taught them.",
    "John 8:3": "And the scribes and Pharisees brought him a woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the midst,",
    "John 8:4": "They say to him, Teacher, this woman was taken committing adultery, in the very act.",
    "John 8:5": "In the law Moses commanded us such to be stoned: therefore what sayest thou?",
    "John 8:6": "And this said they, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. And Jesus, having stooped down, wrote with his fingers upon the earth.",
    "John 8:7": "And when they continued asking him, having lifted up the head, he said to them, Let him faultless among you, first cast a stone at her.",
    "John 8:8": "And again having stooped down, he wrote upon the earth.",
    "John 8:9": "And they having heard, and being convicted by consciousness, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest even to the last; and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.",
    "John 8:10": "And Jesus having lifted up the head, and seen none but the woman, said to her, Woman, where are they accusing thee? has none condemned thee.",
    "John 8:11": "And she said, None, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.",
    "John 8:12": "Again therefore Jesus spake to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he following me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.",
    "John 8:13": "Then said the Pharisees to him, Thou testifiest of thyself; thy testimony is not true.",
    "John 8:14": "Jesus answered and said to them. Though I testify of myself; my testimony is true: for I know whence I came, and where I retire; but ye know not whence I came and where I retire.",
    "John 8:15": "Ye judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.",
    "John 8:16": "And if I also judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father having sent me.",
    "John 8:17": "And also in your law has it been written, that the testimony of two men is true.",
    "John 8:18": "I am he testifying of myself, and the Father having sent me testifies of me.",
    "John 8:19": "Then said they to him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye had known my Father also.",
    "John 8:20": "These words spake Jesus in the royal treasury, teaching in the temple: and no one seized him; for his hour had not yet come.",
    "John 8:21": "Then said Jesus again to them, I retire, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: where I retire, ye cannot come.",
    "John 8:22": "Then said the Jews, Will he not kill himself? for he says, Where I retire, ye cannot come.",
    "John 8:23": "And he said to them, Ye are from below I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.",
    "John 8:24": "I said therefore to you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am, ye shall die in your sins.",
    "John 8:25": "Then said they to him, Who art thou? And Jesus said to them, In the beginning, he which I spake to you.",
    "John 8:26": "Many things have I to speak and judge of you; but he having sent me is true; and what things I have heard from him these say I to the world.",
    "John 8:27": "They knew not that he spake to them of the Father.",
    "John 8:28": "Then said Jesus to them, When ye lift up the Son of man then shall ye know that I am, and I do nothing of myself; but as my Father taught me, these I speak.",
    "John 8:29": "And he having sent me is with me: the Father has not left me alone; for I do always things pleasing to him.",
    "John 8:30": "He speaking these, many believed in him.",
    "John 8:31": "Then said Jesus to the Jews having believed him, If ye remain in my word, ye are truly my disciples.",
    "John 8:32": "And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.",
    "John 8:33": "They answered him, We are Abraham’s seed, and have never served any; how sayest thou, That ye shall be free?",
    "John 8:34": "Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, say I to you, That every one doing sin, is servant of sin.",
    "John 8:35": "And the servant remains not in the house forever; the Son remains forever.",
    "John 8:36": "If the Son make you free, ye shall be truly free.",
    "John 8:37": "I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, for my word has no place in you.",
    "John 8:38": "I, what I have seen from my Father, speak: and ye, therefore, what ye have seen of your Father, do.",
    "John 8:39": "They answered and said to him, Abraham is our Father. Jesus says to them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye had done Abraham’s works.",
    "John 8:40": "And now ye seek to kill me, a man who has spoken to you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not Abraham.",
    "John 8:41": "Ye do the works of your father. Then said they to him, We have not been born of fornication; for we have one Father, God.",
    "John 8:42": "Then said Jesus to them, If God were your Father, ye had loved me: for I went forth from God, and came; for I have not come of myself, but he sent me.",
    "John 8:43": "Wherefore ye know not my speech, for ye cannot hear my word.",
    "John 8:44": "Ye are of your father the devil, and the eager desires of your father will ye do. He was slaying men from the beginning, and stood not in the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he would speak a lie, he speaks of his own things; for he is a liar, and the father of him.",
    "John 8:45": "And because I say the truth, ye believe me not.",
    "John 8:46": "Which of you convicts me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me.",
    "John 8:47": "He being of God hears the words of God: therefore ye hear not, for ye are not of God.",
    "John 8:48": "Then answered the Jews, and said to him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?",
    "John 8:49": "Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honour my Father, and ye dishonour me.",
    "John 8:50": "And I seek not my glory: there is he seeking and judging.",
    "John 8:51": "Truly, truly, I say to you, If any keep my word, he should never see death.",
    "John 8:52": "Then said the Jews to him, Now we have known that thou hast a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If any keep my word, he shall never taste of death.",
    "John 8:53": "Thou art not greater than our father Abraham, who died; and the prophets died: whom makest thou thyself?",
    "John 8:54": "Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father honouring me; whom ye say, that he is your God:",
    "John 8:55": "And ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like you: but I know him, and keep his word.",
    "John 8:56": "Your father Abraham was overjoyed that he might see my day: and he saw, and rejoiced.",
    "John 8:57": "Then said the Jews to him, Thou hast not yet fifty years, and hast thou seen Abraham.",
    "John 8:58": "And Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham was born, I am.",
    "John 8:59": "Then lifted up they stones that they might cast upon him: and Jesus was hid, and he went forth out of the temple, having passed through the midst of them, and so he passed by.",
    "John 9:1": "And passing by, he saw a man blind from birth.",
    "John 9:2": "And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, he, or his parents, that he was born blind?",
    "John 9:3": "Jesus answered, Neither did this sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God might be manifested in him.",
    "John 9:4": "I must work the works of him having sent me, while it is day: night comes, when none can work.",
    "John 9:5": "While I be in the world, I am the light of the world.",
    "John 9:6": "Having said these, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and rubbed the clay upon the eyes of the blind,",
    "John 9:7": "And said to him, Retire, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is interpreted, Sent.) He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing.",
    "John 9:8": "Then the neighbors, and those seeing him before that he was blind, said, Is not this he sitting and begging?",
    "John 9:9": "Others said, This is he: and others, That he is like him: he said, That I am.",
    "John 9:10": "Then said they to him, How were thine eyes opened?",
    "John 9:11": "He answered and said, A man called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said to me, Retire to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and having gone and washed, I saw again.",
    "John 9:12": "Then said they to him, Where is he? He says I know not.",
    "John 9:13": "They bring him to the Pharisees, him once blind.",
    "John 9:14": "And it was the sabbath, when Jesus made clay, and opened his eyes.",
    "John 9:15": "Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he saw again. He said to them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see.",
    "John 9:16": "Then said certain of the Pharisees, This man is not from God, for he keeps not the sabbath. Others said, How can a sinful man do such signs? And a division was among them.",
    "John 9:17": "They say to the blind again, What sayest thou of him, for he opened thine eyes? He said, That he is a prophet.",
    "John 9:18": "Then the Jews believed not of him that he was blind, and saw again, until they called the parents of him having looked up.",
    "John 9:19": "And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, whom ye say that be was born blind how then does be now see.",
    "John 9:20": "His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:",
    "John 9:21": "But how he now sees, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: he has age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.",
    "John 9:22": "These said his parents, for they feared the Jews: for already had the Jews agreed, that if any should acknowledge him Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.",
    "John 9:23": "Therefore said his parents, That he has age; ask him.",
    "John 9:24": "Then called they the man of a second time, who was blind, and said to him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is sinful.",
    "John 9:25": "He answered and said, If he be sinful, I know not: one thing I know, that, being blind, now I see.",
    "John 9:26": "And again said they to him, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?",
    "John 9:27": "He answered them, I told you already, and ye heard not: why wish ye to hear again? ye wish not also to be his disciples?",
    "John 9:28": "Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses’ disciples.",
    "John 9:29": "We know that God has spoken to Moses; but this, we know not whence he is.",
    "John 9:30": "The man answered and said to them, For in this is it wonderful, that ye know not whence he is, and he opened mine eyes.",
    "John 9:31": "And we know that God hears not the sinful: but if any be godly, and do his will, this he hears.",
    "John 9:32": "From forever was it not heard that any opened the eyes of him born blind.",
    "John 9:33": "If this one were not of God, he could do nothing.",
    "John 9:34": "They answered and said to him, In sins wert thou wholly born, and teachest thou us? And they cast him without.",
    "John 9:35": "Jesus heard that they cast him without; and having found him, said to him, Believest thou in the Son of God?",
    "John 9:36": "He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe in him?",
    "John 9:37": "And Jesus said to him, Thou hast also seen him, and he speaking with thee, the same is he.",
    "John 9:38": "And he said I believe, Lord. And he worshipped him.",
    "John 9:39": "And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world, that they not seeing might see; and they seeing might be blind.",
    "John 9:40": "And they being with him of the Pharisees heard these things, and said to him,",
    "John 9:41": "We are not also blind? Jesus said to them If ye were blind, ye had not sinned: and now ye say, That we see; therefore your sin remains.",
    "John 10:1": "Truly, truly, I say to you, He not coming in through the door into the court-yard of the sheep, but coming up from another place, he is a thief and robber.",
    "John 10:2": "And he coming in through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.",
    "John 10:3": "To him the guard of the door opens; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.",
    "John 10:4": "And when he would put forth his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.",
    "John 10:5": "And a stranger they would not follow, but they will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.",
    "John 10:6": "This proverb spake Jesus to then: and they knew not what things they were which he spake to them.",
    "John 10:7": "Then said Jesus again to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, That I am the door of the sheep.",
    "John 10:8": "All who came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep heard them not.",
    "John 10:9": "I am the door: if any come in through me, he shall be saved, and he shall me in, and go out, and find pasture.",
    "John 10:10": "The thief comes not, except that he steal, and sacrifice, and destroy: I came that they might have life, and have above measure.",
    "John 10:11": "I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.",
    "John 10:12": "But the hired one, and not being the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and he leaves the sheep, and flees: and the wolf plunders them, and scatters the sheep.",
    "John 10:13": "The hired flees, because he is hired, and no care is to him for the sheep.",
    "John 10:14": "I am the good shepherd, and I know mine, and am known by mine.",
    "John 10:15": "As the Father knows me, I also know the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.",
    "John 10:16": "And I have, other sheep, which are not of this court-yard: and I must also bring them, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one flock, and one shepherd.",
    "John 10:17": "Therefore does my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.",
    "John 10:18": "No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This command received I of my Father.",
    "John 10:19": "Then was a division again among the Jews for these words.",
    "John 10:20": "And many of them said, He has a demon, and is frenzied; why hear ye him?",
    "John 10:21": "Others said, These are not the words of a demon. A demon cannot open the eyes of the blind.",
    "John 10:22": "And there was the festival of inauguration among the Jerusalemites, and it was winter.",
    "John 10:23": "And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch.",
    "John 10:24": "Then the Jews surrounded him, and said to him, How long takest thou away our soul? If thou art Christ, say to us with freedom of speech.",
    "John 10:25": "Jesus answered them, I said to you, and ye believe not: the works which I do in my Father’s name, these testify of me.",
    "John 10:26": "But ye believe not, for ye are not of my sheep, as I said to you.",
    "John 10:27": "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.",
    "John 10:28": "And I give them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand.",
    "John 10:29": "My Father, who has given to me, is greater than all; and no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand.",
    "John 10:30": "I and my Father are one.",
    "John 10:31": "Then again lifted up the Jews stones that they might stone him.",
    "John 10:32": "Jesus Answered them, Many good works I shewed you from my Father; for which of these works do ye stone me.",
    "John 10:33": "The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and that thou, being man, makest thyself God.",
    "John 10:34": "Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said; Ye are gods?",
    "John 10:35": "If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came, and the writing cannot be loosed;",
    "John 10:36": "Whom the Father consecrated, and sent into the world, say ye that thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God.",
    "John 10:37": "If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.",
    "John 10:38": "And if I do, though ye believe me not, believe the works: that ye might know, and believe, that the Father in me, and I in him.",
    "John 10:39": "Then sought they again to take him: and he went out from their hand,",
    "John 10:40": "And again he departed beyond Jordan to the place where John was first immersing; and he remained there.",
    "John 10:41": "And many came to him, and said, That truly John did no sign: but all which John said of him was true.",
    "John 10:42": "And many believed in him there.",
    "John 11:1": "And a certain Lazarus was sick, from Bethany, of the town of Mary And Martha her sister.",
    "John 11:2": "(And Mary was she having anointed the Lord with perfumed oil, and wiped his feet with her hairs, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)",
    "John 11:3": "Then sent the sisters to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.",
    "John 11:4": "And Jesus having heard, said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that by it the Son of God be honoured.",
    "John 11:5": "And Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.",
    "John 11:6": "When therefore he heard that he is sick, then indeed he remained in the place in which he was two days.",
    "John 11:7": "Then after this he says to his disciples, Let us go into Judea again.",
    "John 11:8": "The disciples say to him, Rabbi, now the Jews sought to stone thee; and retirest thou there again?",
    "John 11:9": "Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours of the day? If any walk in the day, he stumbles not, for he sees the light of this world.",
    "John 11:10": "But if any walk in the night, he stumbles, for light is not in him.",
    "John 11:11": "These things said he: and after this he says to them, Lazarus our friend has been set to sleep; but I go, that I might waken him.",
    "John 11:12": "Then said his disciples, Lord, if he has been set to sleep, he shall be saved.",
    "John 11:13": "And Jesus spake of his death: but these supposed that he speaks of the repose of sleep.",
    "John 11:14": "Then therefore Jesus said to them with freedom of speech, Lazarus is dead.",
    "John 11:15": "And I rejoice for you, that ye might believe, that I was not there; but let us go to him.",
    "John 11:16": "Then said Thomas, called Didymus, to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we might die with him.",

    "John 11:24": "Martha says to him, I know that he shall rise at the rising up in the last day.",
    "John 11:25": "Jesus said to her, I am the rising up, and life: he believing in me, though he die, shall live.",
    "John 11:26": "And all living and believing in me should never die. Believest thou this?",
    "John 11:27": "She says to him, Yes, Lord: I have believed that thou art Christ, the Son of God, he coming into the world.",

    "John 11:29": "She, when she heard, arises quickly, and comes to him.",
    "John 11:30": "And Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in the place where Martha met him.",
    "John 11:31": "Then the Jews being in the house with her, and consoling her, having seen Mary, that she rose quickly and went forth, followed her, saying, That she retires to the tomb, that she might weep there.",
    "John 11:32": "Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was, seeing him, fell at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou wert here, my brother had not died.",
    "John 11:33": "Then Jesus, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping having come with her, was heavy in spirit, and troubled himself,",
    "John 11:34": "And said, Where have ye laid him? They say to him, Lord, come and see.",
    "John 11:35": "Jesus wept.",
    "John 11:36": "Then said the Jews, See how he loved him!",
    "John 11:37": "And certain of them said, Could not he having opened the eyes of the blind, have made that this should not die?",

    "John 11:39": "Jesus says, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the dead, says to him, Lord, he already smells: for it is the fourth day.",
    "John 11:40": "Jesus says to her, Said I not to thee, if thou shouldest believe, thou shalt see the glory of God.",
    "John 11:41": "Then took they away the stone where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes above, and said, Father, I return thee thanks that thou didst hear me.",
    "John 11:42": "And I knew that thou always hearest me: but for the crowd standing round I said, that they might believe that thou didst send me.",
    "John 11:43": "And having said these, he cried out with a great voice, Lazarus, come out.",
    "John 11:44": "And the dead came out, bound feet and hands with bandages; and his face was bound with a napkin. Jesus says to them, Loose him, and let him retire.",
    "John 11:45": "Then many of the Jews, having come to Mary, and seeing what Jesus did, believed in him.",
    "John 11:46": "But certain of them departed to the Pharisees, and said to them what Jesus did.",
    "John 11:47": "Then gathered together the chief priests and Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man does many signs.",
    "John 11:48": "If we let him thus go, all will believe on him: and the Romans will come and take away also our place and nation.",
    "John 11:49": "And a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being chief priest that year, said to them, Ye know nothing,",
    "John 11:50": "Neither turn ye in your thoughts that it is profitable to us, that one man die for the people, and the nation perish not.",
    "John 11:51": "And this he said not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation;",
    "John 11:52": "And not for the nation alone, but that also the children of God, scattered, should be gathered into one.",
    "John 11:53": "Then from that day they counselled together that they might kill him.",
    "John 11:54": "Jesus then walked no more with freedom of speech among the Jews; but departed thence to the country near the desert, to a city called Ephraim, and there he tarried with his disciples.",
    "John 11:55": "And the Jews’ pascha was near: and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the pascha, that they might purify themselves.",
    "John 11:56": "Then sought they Jesus, and said with one another, standing in the temple, What seems it to you, that he should not come to the festival.",
    "John 11:57": "And also the chief priests and Pharisees had given a command, that if any know where he is, he should make known, that they might take him.",
    "John 12:1": "Then Jesus, six days before the pascha, came to Bethany, where was Lazarus the dead, whom he raised from the dead.",
    "John 12:2": "Then made they him a supper there, and Martha served; and Lazarus was one of them reclining at table with him.",
    "John 12:3": "Then Mary having taken a pound of perfumed oil of spikenard, very precious, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hairs: and the house was filled with the smell of the perfumed oil.",
    "John 12:4": "Then says one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, of Simon, being about to deliver him up,",
    "John 12:5": "Wherefore was not this perfumed oil sold for three hundred drachmas, and given to the poor?",
    "John 12:6": "And this he said, not that care was to him for the poor: but because he was a thief, and had the small coffer, and carried things deposited.",
    "John 12:7": "Then said Jesus, Let her go; for the day of my interment has she kept this.",
    "John 12:8": "For the poor have ye always with you; and me ye have not always.",
    "John 12:9": "Then a great crowd of Jews knew that he is there: and they came not for Jesus alone, but that also they might see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.",
    "John 12:10": "And the chief priests took counsel that they might also kill Lazarus;",
    "John 12:11": "Because many for him retired, and believed in Jesus.",
    "John 12:12": "The morrow a great crowd, having come to the festival, having heard that Jesus comes to Jerusalem,",
    "John 12:13": "Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to the meeting to him, and cried, Praised he coming in the name of the Lord, King of Israel.",
    "John 12:14": "And Jesus having found a small ass, sat upon it; as it is written,",
    "John 12:15": "Fear not, O daughter of Sion: behold, thy King comes, sitting upon the foal of an ass.",
    "John 12:16": "And these the disciples knew not at first: but when Jesus was honoured, then remembered they that these were written of him, and they did these things to him.",
    "John 12:17": "The crowd therefore testified which being with him, that he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead.",
    "John 12:18": "And for this the crowd met him, for they heard he had done this sign.",
    "John 12:19": "Then said the Pharisees among themselves, Ye see that ye aid nothing; behold, the world has departed after him.",
    "John 12:20": "And there were certain Greeks of those going up that they might worship in the festival:",
    "John 12:21": "These then came to Philip, him of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Lord, we wish to see Jesus.",
    "John 12:22": "Philip comes and says to Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip say to Jesus.",
    "John 12:23": "And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come, that the Son of man should be honoured.",
    "John 12:24": "Truly, truly, I say to you, except a kernel of wheat, having fallen into the earth, should die, it remains alone: and if it should die, it brings forth much fruit.",
    "John 12:25": "He loving his soul shall lose it; but he hating his soul in this world, shall guard it for life eternal.",
    "John 12:26": "If any one would serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall be my servant: and if any one serve me, him will the Father honour.",
    "John 12:27": "Now has my soul been troubled; and what should I say? O Father, save me from this hour: but for this came I to this hour.",
    "John 12:28": "Father, honour thy name. Then came a voice from heaven, I have also honoured, and will again honour.",
    "John 12:29": "Then the crowd, having stood and heard, said it was thunder: others said, A messenger has spoken to him.",
    "John 12:30": "Jesus answered and said, This voice has not been for me, but for you.",
    "John 12:31": "Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the ruler of this world be cast out.",
    "John 12:32": "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all to myself.",
    "John 12:33": "This said he, signifying what death he was about to die.",
    "John 12:34": "The crowd answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ remains forever: and how sayest thou That the Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?",
    "John 12:35": "Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little time the light is with you. Walk while ye have light, lest darkness overtake you: and he walking in darkness knows not where he retires.",
    "John 12:36": "While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye might be the sons of light. These things spake Jesus, and having departed, he was hid from them.",
    "John 12:37": "And he having done so many signs before them, they did not believe in him:",
    "John 12:38": "That the word of Esaias the prophet might be completed, which he spake, Lord, who believed our report? and to whom was the arm of the Lord revealed?",
    "John 12:39": "Therefore they could not believe, for Esaias said again,",
    "John 12:40": "He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart: lest they see with the eyes, and understand with the heart, and should turn back, and I should heal them.",
    "John 12:41": "These said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.",
    "John 12:42": "Yet nevertheless also many of the rulers believed in him; but on account of the Pharisees they did not acknowledge, lest they should be excluded from the synagogue:",
    "John 12:43": "For they loved the honour of men more than the honour of God.",
    "John 12:44": "Jesus cried and said, He believing in me, believes not in me, but in him having sent me.",
    "John 12:45": "And he seeing me, sees him having sent me.",
    "John 12:46": "I have come a light into the world, that every one believing in me should not remain in darkness.",
    "John 12:47": "And if any hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not that I might judge the world, but that I might save the world.",
    "John 12:48": "He rejecting me, and not receiving my words, has him judging him: the word which I spake, that shall judge him in the last day.",
    "John 12:49": "For I spake not of myself; but the Father having sent me, he gave me a command, what I should say, and what I should speak.",
    "John 12:50": "And I know that his command is life eternal: therefore what I speak, as the Father said to me, so I speak.",
    "John 13:1": "And before the feast of the pascha, Jesus knowing that his hour had come that he should pass out of this world to the Father, having loved his own in the world, he loved them to the end.",
    "John 13:2": "And supper having been, the devil having already cast into the heart of Judas Iscariot, of Simon, that he should deliver him up;",
    "John 13:3": "Jesus knowing that the Father has given all things to him into the hands, and that he came out from God, and retired to God;",
    "John 13:4": "He arises from supper, and lays down the garments; and having taken a linen cloth, he girded himself.",
    "John 13:5": "Then casts he water into a washing vessel, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe with the linen cloth with which he was girded.",
    "John 13:6": "And he comes to Simon Peter: and he says to him, Lord, washest thou my feet?",
    "John 13:7": "Jesus answered and said to him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know after these.",
    "John 13:8": "Peter says to him, Thou shouldest never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, Except I wash thee, thou hast no part with me.",
    "John 13:9": "Simon Peter says to him, Lord, not my feet only, but the hands and head.",
    "John 13:10": "Jesus says to him, He washed has no need but to have the feet washed, but is wholly clean: and ye are clean, but not all.",
    "John 13:11": "For he knew him delivering him up, therefore he said, Ye are not all clean.",
    "John 13:12": "When therefore he washed their feet; and took his garments, going to recline again, he said to them, Knew ye what I have done to you?",
    "John 13:13": "Ye call one Teacher and Lord: and ye say well; for I am.",
    "John 13:14": "If therefore, I washed your feet, the Lord and Teacher; ye also ought to wash the feet of one another:",
    "John 13:15": "For I have given you a pattern, as I have done to you, also should ye do.",
    "John 13:16": "Truly, truly I say to you, The servant is not greater than his Lord; neither the sent greater than he having sent him.",
    "John 13:17": "If ye know these, happy are ye if ye do them.",
    "John 13:18": "I say not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the writing might be completed, He chewing bread with me lifted up his heel against me.",
    "John 13:19": "From now I say to you, before it shall be, that, when it should be, ye might believe that I am.",
    "John 13:20": "Truly, truly, I say to you, He receiving whomsoever I shall send receives me; and he receiving me receives him having sent me.",
    "John 13:21": "These things Jesus having spoken, was troubled in spirit, and he testified, and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you shall deliver me up.",
    "John 13:22": "Then looked the disciples one upon another, being perplexed of whom he spake.",
    "John 13:23": "And there was one of his disciples reclining on the bosom of Jesus, whom he loved.",
    "John 13:24": "Then Simon Peter nodded to this one, to inquire who it might be of whom he speaks.",
    "John 13:25": "And he reclining upon Jesus’ breast says to him, Lord, who is it?",
    "John 13:26": "Jesus answers, This is he to whom I, having dipped a small morsel, shall bestow. And having dipped the small morsel, he gives to Judas Iscariot, of Simon.",
    "John 13:27": "And after the small morsel then came Satan into him. Then says Jesus to him, What thou doest, do quickly.",
    "John 13:28": "And this none of the reclining knew for what he said to him.",
    "John 13:29": "For some thought, since Judas had the small coffer, that Jesus says to him, Purchase of what we have need for the festival; or, that he might give something to the poor.",
    "John 13:30": "He having taken the small morsel went quickly forth: and it was night when he then went forth.",
    "John 13:31": "Jesus says, Now was the Son of man honoured, and God was honoured in him.",
    "John 13:32": "If God were honoured in him, also shall God honour him in himself, and quickly shall he honour him.",
    "John 13:33": "Little children, yet a little am I with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said to the Jews, That where I retire, ye cannot come; and I say to you now.",
    "John 13:34": "A new command give I to you, That ye love one another: as I loved you, that ye also love one another.",
    "John 13:35": "In this all shall know that ye are disciples to me, if ye have love in one another.",
    "John 13:36": "Simon Peter says to him, Lord, where retirest thou? Jesus answered him, Where I retire, thou shalt not be able to follow me now; and afterwards thou shalt follow me.",
    "John 13:37": "Peter says to him, Lord, why can I not follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee.",
    "John 13:38": "Jesus answered, Wilt thou lay down thy life for me Truly, truly, I say to thee, The cock shall not utter a sound, till thou deny me thrice.",
    "John 14:1": "Let not your heart be troubled: believe in God, and believe in me.",
    "John 14:2": "In my Father’s house are many dwellings: and if not, I had said to you. I go to prepare a place for you.",
    "John 14:3": "And if I go and prepare a place for you, again I come, and I will receive you to myself; that where I am, ye might be also.",
    "John 14:4": "And where I retire ye know, and the way ye know.",
    "John 14:5": "Thomas says to him, Lord, we know not where thou retirest; and how can we know the way?",
    "John 14:6": "Jesus says to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one comes to the Father, except by me.",
    "John 14:7": "If ye had known me, ye had also known my Father: and from now ye know, and have seen him.",
    "John 14:8": "Philip says to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it suffices us.",

    "John 14:10": "Believest thou not that I in the Father, and the Father is in me? the words which I speak to you, I speak not of myself: and the Father remaining in me does the works.",
    "John 14:11": "Believe ye me that I in the Father, and the Father in me: and if not, for these works believe me.",
    "John 14:12": "Truly, truly, I say to you, He believing in me, the works which I do shall he do also; and greater than these shall he do; for I go to my Father.",

    "John 14:21": "He having my commands, and keeping them, the same is he loving me: and he loving me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and manifest myself to him.",
    "John 14:22": "Judas says to him, not Iscariot, Lord, how has it been that thou art about to make thyself manifest to us, and not to the world?",
    "John 14:23": "Jesus answered and said to him, If any one love me, he will keep my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and we will make our stay with him.",
    "John 14:24": "He not loving me will not keep my words: and the word which ye hear is not of me, but of the Father having sent me.",
    "John 14:25": "These have I spoken to you, remaining with you.",
    "John 14:26": "But the Intercessor, the Holy Spirit, which the Father will send in my name, the same shall teach you all things, and he shall remind you of all things which I spake to you.",

    "John 18:36": "Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, my servants had contended, that I be not delivered to the Jews; and now my kingdom is not hence.",
    "John 18:37": "Then said Pilate to him, Art thou not then king? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am king. For this was I born, and for this came I into the world, that I testify to the truth. Every one being of the truth hears my voice.",

    "John 19:11": "Jesus answered, Thou hast no power against me, if it were not given thee from above: therefore he delivering me to thee has greater sin.",
    "John 19:12": "From this Pilate sought to loose him: and the Jews cried out, saying, If thou loose this, thou art not Caesar’s friend: every one making himself a king speaks against Caesar.",

    "John 19:24": "Then said they to one another, Let us not divide it, but let us draw lots for it, whose it shall be: that the writing might be completed, saying, They divided my garments to themselves, and upon my clothing cast they the lot. Then truly did the soldiers these things.",
    "John 19:25": "And by the cross of Jesus stood his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.",
    "John 19:26": "Jesus then having seen the mother, and the disciple standing near, whom he loved, says to his mother, Woman, behold thy son!",

    "Romans 8:14": "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God.",
    "Romans 8:15": "For ye have not received the Spirit of servitude again for fear; but have received the Spirit of adoption as a son, in which we cry, Abba, Father.",

    "1 Corinthians 1:16": "And I immersed also the house of Stephanas: besides, I know not if I immersed any other.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:17": "For Christ sent me not to immerse, but to announce good news: not in wisdom of word, lest the cross of Christ be made void.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:18": "For truly the word of the cross to them perishing is foolishness; but to us saved it is the power of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:19": "For it has been written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and put away the understanding of the intelligent.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:20": "Where the wise? where the scribe? where the seekers together of this life has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?",
    "1 Corinthians 1:21": "For since in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, God was contented by the foolishness of proclaiming to save them believing.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:22": "And since the Jews ask a sign, and the Greeks seek wisdom:",
    "1 Corinthians 1:23": "And we proclaim Christ crucified, to the Jews truly a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness;",
    "1 Corinthians 1:24": "And to these the called, to both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and wisdom of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:25": "For the foolish thing of God is wiser than men; and the weak thing of God is stronger than men.",

    "1 Corinthians 1:27": "But the foolish things of the world, has God chosen that he might shame the wise; and the weak things of the world has God chosen that he might shame things strong;",
    "1 Corinthians 1:28": "And the ignoble things of the world, and the despised things, has God chosen, and things not being, that the things being he might leave unemployed:",
    "1 Corinthians 1:29": "That no flesh might boast before him.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:30": "And ye are of him in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and also justice, and consecration, and holiness:",
    "1 Corinthians 1:31": "That, as it has been written, Let him boasting, boast in the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:1": "And I having come to you, brethren, came not with eminence of word or of wisdom, announcing to you the testimony of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:2": "For I judged not to know any thing among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:3": "And I, in weakness, and in fear, and in much tremor, was with you.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:4": "And my word and my proclaiming not in persuasible words of man’s wisdom, but in manifestation of the Spirit and of power.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:5": "That your faith might not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:6": "But we speak wisdom among the perfected: and the wisdom not of this life, nor of the rulers of this life, they being left unemployed:",
    "1 Corinthians 2:7": "But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, hidden, which God determined beforehand, before the times to our glory:",

    "1 Corinthians 2:9": "But as has been written. Which the eye saw not, and the ear heard not, and upon the heart of man it came not up, what things God has prepared for them loving him.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:10": "And God has revealed to us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, and the deep things of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:11": "For who of men knows the things of men except the spirit of man in him? so also the things of God no one knows, except the Spirit of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:12": "And we have not received the spirit of the world, but the spirit from God; that we might know things bestowed upon us as a gift by God.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:13": "Which also we speak, not in words taught of man’s wisdom, but in them taught of the Holy Spirit; examining spiritual things by spiritual.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:14": "And the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: and he cannot know, for they are spiritually examined.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:15": "And the spiritual truly examines all things, and he is examined by no one.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:16": "For who knew the mind of the Lord, who shall instruct him And we have the mind of Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:1": "And I, brethren, was not able to speak to you as spiritual, but as carnal, as babes in Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:2": "I have given you milk to drink, and not food; for ye were not able, but neither now are ye yet able.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:3": "For yet are ye carnal: for wherefore envy in you, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk according to man?",
    "1 Corinthians 3:4": "For when a certain one should say, I truly am of Paul; and another, I of Apollos; are ye not carnal?",
    "1 Corinthians 3:5": "Who then is Paul, and who Apollos, but servants by whom ye believed, and to each as the Lord gave?",
    "1 Corinthians 3:6": "I have planted, Apollos watered; but God increased.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:7": "So that neither he planting is anything, neither he watering; but God increasing.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:8": "And he planting and he watering are one: and each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:9": "For we are workers together with God: the agriculture of God, ye are the building of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:10": "According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise chief-architect, I have laid the foundation, and another builds upon. And let each see how he builds upon.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:11": "For none is able to lay another foundation above that laid, which is Jesus the Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:12": "And if any one build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stalks;",
    "1 Corinthians 3:13": "The work of each shall be manifested: for the day shall manifest, for in fire it is revealed; and the work of each, what sort it is, the fire shall prove.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:14": "If the work of any shall remain which he built upon, he shall receive a reward.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:15": "If the work of any one shall be burned, he shall be caused damage: and he shall be saved; and so as by fire.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:16": "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and the spirit of God dwells in you?",
    "1 Corinthians 3:17": "If any one destroy the temple of God, him will God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which ye are.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:18": "Let none completely deceive himself. If any think to be wise in this life, let him be foolish, that he may he wise.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:19": "For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it has been written, He seizing the wise in their deceptions.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:20": "And again, The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:21": "Therefore let none boast in men. For all things are yours;",
    "1 Corinthians 3:22": "Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or about to be; all are yours;",
    "1 Corinthians 3:23": "And ye of Christ; and Christ of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:1": "So let a man reckon us, as servants of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:2": "And besides it is sought in stewards, that any one be found faithful.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:3": "And to me it is the least that I be judged by you, or by man’s day: but neither do I judge myself.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:4": "For I know nothing by myself; but in this I have not been justified: and he examining me is the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:5": "Therefore judge ye nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who also, will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of hearts: and then shall praise be to each from God.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:6": "And these things, brethren, I transformed to myself and to Apollos for you; that ye might learn in us not to think above what has been written, lest ye be puffed up one above one against the other.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:7": "For who distinguishes thee? and what hast thou which thou didst not receive? and if thou also didst receive, why dost thou boast, as not having received?",
    "1 Corinthians 4:8": "Already were ye satisfied, already were ye rich, without us ye reigned; and I would ye also reigned, that we also might reign together with you.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:9": "For I think that God has exhibited us the last sent, as exposed to death; for we were a theatre to the world, and to messengers, and to men.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:10": "We foolish for Christ, and ye wise in Christ; we weak, and ye strong; ye honourable, and we dishonoured.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:11": "Until this present hour we also hunger, and thirst, and we are naked, and are cuffed, and are unsteady.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:12": "And we are wearied, working with our own hands: being reviled, we praise; being driven out, we hold up.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:13": "Being defamed, we entreat: as the filth of the world were we become, the offscouring of all until now.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:14": "Not shaming you, write I these, but as my beloved children I admonish you.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:15": "For if ye have ten thousand preceptors in Christ, but not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus by the good news I begat you.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:16": "I beseech you therefore, be ye imitators of me.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:17": "Therefore sent I Timotheus to you, who is my beloved child, and faithful in the Lord, who will remind you of all my ways in Christ, as I teach everywhere in all the churches.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:18": "And as my not coming to you, some were puffed up.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:19": "And I will come to you swiftly, if the Lord will, and I shall know not the word of those puffed up, but the power.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:20": "For the kingdom of God not in word, but in power.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:21": "What will ye? should I come to you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?",
    "1 Corinthians 5:1": "In general is fornication heard among you, and such fornication which is not named in the nations, for any to have his father’s wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:2": "And ye were puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he having done this work might be taken away from the midst of you.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:3": "For I truly, as being at a distance in body, and being present in spirit, have already, as being present, judged him having so worked this.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:4": "In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, ye, gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,",
    "1 Corinthians 5:5": "To deliver such a one to Satan for the ruin of the flesh, that the spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:6": "Your boasting not good. Know ye not that a little leaven may leaven the whole mixture?",
    "1 Corinthians 5:7": "Therefore cleanse out the old leaven, that ye may be a new mixture, as ye are unleavened. For also our pascha was sacrificed for us, Christ:",
    "1 Corinthians 5:8": "Therefore let us keep the festival, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of vice and wickedness; but with the unleavened of frankincense and truth.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:9": "I wrote to you in the epistle not to mix together with fornicators.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:10": "And not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or the rapacious, or idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:11": "And now I wrote to you not to mix together, if any called a brother is a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or intoxicated, or rapacious; not to eat with such.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:12": "For what to me also to judge them without? do ye yourselves judge them within.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:13": "And them without God judges. And take ye away evil from yourselves.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:1": "Dare any of you, having an affair with another, be judged by the unjust, and not by the holy ones?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:2": "Know ye not that the holy ones shall judge the world? and if the world be judged by you, are ye unworthy of the least judgments?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:3": "Know ye not that we shall judge messengers? also not only things pertaining to the cares of life?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:4": "Therefore truly, if ye have judgments pertaining to the cares of life, set them counted as nothing in the church.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:5": "For confusion I speak to you. So is there not one wise with you, who will be able to judge between his brother?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:6": "But brother with brother is judged, and this by the unbelieving.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:7": "Therefore truly, already is there wholly a misfortune in you, that ye have judgments with yourselves. Wherefore had ye not rather be treated ill? wherefore had ye not rather be defrauded?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:8": "But ye treat ill, and defraud, and that the brethren.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:9": "Or know ye not that the unjust shall not inherit the kingdom of God Be ye not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor sodomites,",
    "1 Corinthians 6:10": "Nor thieves; nor covetous, nor intoxicated, nor railers, nor rapacious, shall inherit the kingdom of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:11": "And these were some of you: but ye were washed, but ye were consecrated, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:12": "All things are lawful to me, but all are not profitable: all are lawful to me, but I will not be exercised by power under any.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:13": "Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods: and God will also leave unemployed this and them. And the body not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:14": "And God also raised up the Lord, and us will he also raise up by his power.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:15": "Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? having taken the members of Christ, shall I make members of a harlot? It may not be.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:16": "Or know ye not that he joined to a harlot is one body? for they shall be, he says, they two into one flesh.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:17": "And he joined to the Lord is one spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:18": "Flee fornication. Every sin which if a man do is without the body; but he committing fornication sins against his own body.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:19": "Or know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit in you, which ye have from God, and ye are not your own?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:20": "For ye were bought for a price: then glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:1": "And of what ye wrote to me: good for a man not to touch a woman.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:2": "And, on account of fornication, let each have his own wife, and let each have her own husband.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:3": "Let the husband return to the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife to the husband.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:4": "The wife of her own body has not power, but the husband: and likewise also the husband of his own body has not power, but the wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:5": "Deprive ye not one another, except somewhat of an agreement for a time, that ye might have leisure for fasting and prayer; and again upon the same ye might come together, lest Satan tempt you for your want of self command.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:6": "And this I say according to indulgence, not according to order.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:7": "For I will all men to be as also myself. But each has his own favor of God, the one truly thus, and the other thus.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:8": "And I say to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they remain also as I.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:9": "And if they have not self command, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to be set on fire.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:10": "And to the married I announce, (not I, but the Lord,) The wife not to be separated from the husband:",
    "1 Corinthians 7:11": "And if also she be separated, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to the husband: and the husband not to send away the wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:12": "And to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother have an unbelieving wife, and she assents to dwell with him, let him not send her away.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:13": "And the woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he assents to dwell with her, let her not send him away.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:14": "For the unbelieving husband was consecrated in the wife, and the unbelieving wife was consecrated in the husband: for then are our children unclean; and now are they holy.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:15": "And if the unbelieving is separated, let him be separated. A brother or a sister has not been reduced to slavery in such things as these: and God has called us in peace.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:16": "For what knowest thou, O wife, if thou shalt save the husband or what knowest thou, O husband, if thou shalt save the wife?",
    "1 Corinthians 7:17": "Except as God divided to each, as the Lord has called each, so let him walk. And so I ordain in all the churches.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:18": "Whoever was called circumcised? let him not be drawn to himself. Whoever was called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:19": "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commands of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:20": "Each in the calling which he was called, in this let him remain.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:21": "A servant wert thou called? let it not concern thee: for if thou art able to be free, rather make use of it.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:22": "For the servant called in the Lord, is the freedman of the Lord: likewise also the freedman called, is the servant of Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:23": "Ye were bought for a price; be ye not servants of men.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:24": "Each, in what he was called, brethren, in this let him remain with God.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:25": "But for virgins I have not an order of the Lord: and I give an opinion as compassionated by the Lord to be faithful.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:26": "I think therefore this to be good for the present necessity, that it is good for a man to be thus.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:27": "Hast thou been bound to a wife? seek not a release. Hast thou been loosed from a wife seek thou not a wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:28": "And if also thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she has not sinned. And such shall have pressure to the flesh: and I spare you.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:29": "And this I say, brethren, the time is restricted; as to the rest, that they also having wives should be as not having;",
    "1 Corinthians 7:30": "And they weeping, as not weeping; and they rejoicing, as not rejoicing; and they buying, as not possessing.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:31": "And they using this world, as not using; for the form of this world passes away.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:32": "But I will you to be free from care. The unmarried cares for things of the Lord, how he shall please the Lord:",
    "1 Corinthians 7:33": "And he married cares for the things of the world, how he shall please the wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:34": "The wife and virgin have been divided. The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, that she might be holy also in body and spirit: and she married cares for the things of the world, how she shall please her husband.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:35": "And this I say for the advantage of yourselves; not that I shall cast a net upon you, but for the becoming, and occupied assiduously for the Lord without being turned away.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:36": "And if any think to act unbecomingly towards his virgin, if she be past the vigor of youth, and so it ought to be, let him do what he will, he sins not; let them marry.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:37": "And he who has stood firmly fixed in heart; not having necessity, and has power concerning his own will, and has judged this in his heart to keep his virgin, does well.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:38": "So that he marrying does well; and he not marrying does better.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:39": "The woman was bound by law for as much time as her husband lives; and if her husband be set to sleep, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:40": "And she is happier if she so remain, according to my opinion: and I also think to have the Spirit of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:1": "And concerning sacrifice to idols, we know, (for we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, and love builds the house.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:2": "And if any one thinks to know anything, as yet he has known nothing as he ought to know.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:3": "And if any one love God, the same is known of him.)",
    "1 Corinthians 8:4": "Concerning food therefore of sacrifices to idols, we know that an idol nothing in the world, and that none other God but one.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:5": "For also though they are called gods, whether in heaven, whether upon the earth, (for there are many gods, and many lords,)",
    "1 Corinthians 8:6": "But to us one God, the Father, of whom all things, and we for him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom all things, and we by him.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:7": "But not in all, knowledge: and some with consciousness of the idol even till now eat as a sacrifice to idols: and their consciousness being weak is contaminated.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:8": "And food sets us not before God: for neither, if we eat, do we abound; neither if we eat not, do we want.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:9": "And see ye lest this your power be a stumble to the weak.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:10": "For if any one see thee having knowledge reclining in the idol’s temple, shall not his consciousness, being weak, be built up to eat the sacrifices to idols;",
    "1 Corinthians 8:11": "And shall the weak brother be destroyed upon thy knowledge, for whom Christ died?",
    "1 Corinthians 8:12": "And so sinning against the brethren, and striking their weak consciousness, ye sin against Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:13": "Wherefore, if food offend my brother, I will eat no flesh forever, lest I shall offend my brother.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:1": "Am I not sent? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are ye not my work in the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:2": "If to others I am not sent, but surely I am to you: for the seal of my sending are ye in the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:3": "My justification to them examining me is this,",
    "1 Corinthians 9:4": "have we not power to eat and to drink?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:5": "Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife; as also the rest of the sent, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:6": "Or I only and Barnabas, have we not power not to work?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:7": "Who makes war at any time at his own charges who plants a vineyard, and eats not of its fruit or who feeds a flock, and eats not of the milk of the flock?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:8": "Not according to man do I speak these things: or does not the law also say these things?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:9": "For in the law of Moses has been written, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox grinding. Is there not care to God for oxen?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:10": "Or does he say altogether on account of us? For it was written on account of us: that he ploughing ought to plough upon hope; and he grinding upon hope, to participate with his hope.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:11": "If we have sown to you spiritual things, is it great if we shall reap your carnal things?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:12": "If others participate with your power, not rather we? But we used not this power; but endure all things, lest we give some hindrance to the good news of Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:13": "Do ye not know that they working consecrated things, eat of the temple? they working diligently at the altar, share together with the altar?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:14": "Thus also the Lord appointed to them announcing good news to live of the good news.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:15": "But I used none of these things: and I wrote not these things, that thus it might be with me: for good to me rather to die, than that any should render my boasting void.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:16": "For if I announce the good news, there is no boasting to me: for necessity is laid upon me; and woe is to me, if I announce not the good news!",
    "1 Corinthians 9:17": "For if of free will I do this, I have reward: and if unwillingly, I have been entrusted with a stewardship.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:18": "What reward therefore is to me? That announcing good news, I shall make the good news of Christ not expensive, not to make use of my power in the good news.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:19": "For being free from all, I have subjected myself to all, that I might gain the more.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:20": "And I was to the Jews as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews: to them under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them under the law;",
    "1 Corinthians 9:21": "To the lawless, as lawless, (not being lawless to God, but subject to the law to Christ,) that I might gain the lawless,",
    "1 Corinthians 9:22": "I became to the weak as weak, that I might gain the weak: I have been all things to all, that altogether I might save some.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:23": "And this I do on account of the good news, that I might become a partaker of it.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:24": "Do ye not know that they running in a race-course, all truly run, and one receives the prize of combat? Do ye so run, that ye might receive.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:25": "And every one contending for the prize, has self command in all things. These surely therefore that they might receive a corruptible crown; and we an incorruptible.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:26": "I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so practise I pugilism, as not laying stripes upon air:",
    "1 Corinthians 9:27": "But I give my body a blow under the eyes, and reduce to bondage: lest having proclaimed to others, I myself be rejected.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:1": "And I will not ye be ignorant, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;",
    "1 Corinthians 10:2": "And were all immersed into Moses in the cloud, and in the sea;",
    "1 Corinthians 10:3": "And they all ate the same spiritual food.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:4": "And all drank the same spiritual drink: for they drank of the spiritual Rock following; and the Rock was Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:5": "But God was not contented with the most of them: for they were overthrown in the desert.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:6": "And these things were our types, that we be not eagerly desirous of evil things, as they also eagerly desired.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:7": "Neither be ye idolaters, as some of them; as has been written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:8": "Neither should we commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication, and there fell in one day twenty-three thousand.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:9": "Neither should we tempt Christ, as also some of them tempted, and were destroyed by serpents.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:10": "Neither do ye murmur, as also some of them murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:11": "And all those happened types to them; and it was written for our reminding, to whom the ends of the times have arrived.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:12": "Therefore let him seeming to stand see that he fall not.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:13": "No temptation except human has taken you and God faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able; but with the temptation will he also make an escape, that ye may be able to bear.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:14": "Wherefore, my beloved, do ye flee from idolatry.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:15": "As to the wise speak I; judge ye what I say.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:16": "The cup of praise which we praise, is it not the mutual participation of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the mutual participation of the body of Christ?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:17": "That, one bread, one body, we are many: for we all partake of one bread.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:18": "See ye Israel according to the flesh: are not they eating the sacrifices mutual participators of the altar?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:19": "What do I say therefore? that an idol is any thing? or that what is sacrificed to an idol is any thing?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:20": "But, that what things they sacrifice the nations sacrifice to demons, and not to God: and I will not ye be partakers of demons.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:21": "Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: ye cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and the table of demons.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:22": "Do we emulate the Lord? are we stronger than he?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:23": "All things are lawful to me, but all are not profitable: all things are lawful to me, but all build not the house.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:24": "Let none seek his own, but each another’s.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:25": "Every thing being sold in the market, eat, ye, interrogating nothing through consciousness:",
    "1 Corinthians 10:26": "For of the Lord the earth, and its fulness.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:27": "And if any one of the unbelieving call you, and ye wish to go; every thing set before you, eat, interrogating nothing through consciousness.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:28": "And if any one say to you, This is sacrificed to an idol, eat not, for him making it known, and consciousness: for of the Lord the earth, and its fulness:",
    "1 Corinthians 10:29": "And consciousness, I say, not thine, but another’s: for that why is my freedom judged by another’s consciousness.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:30": "And if I partake by grace, why am I defamed for what I give thanks?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:31": "Whether therefore ye eat, whether ye drink, or what ye do, do ye all things to the glory of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:32": "And be ye not molesters to the Jews, and the Greeks, and to the church of God:",
    "1 Corinthians 10:33": "As I also please in all things to all, not seeking my advantage, but that of many, that they might be saved.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:1": "Be ye imitators of me, as I also of Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:2": "And I approve you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and as I have delivered to you, do ye hold the traditions.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:3": "And I will you to know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman the man; and the head of Christ God.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:4": "Every man praying or prophesying, having on the head, shames his head.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:5": "And every woman praying or prophesying with head uncovered shames her head: for it is one and the same to her having been shaved.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:6": "For if the woman is not covered, let her also be shorn: and if shameful to the woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:7": "For truly the man ought not to have the head covered, being the image and glory of God: and the woman is the glory of the man.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:8": "For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:9": "For also the man was not created through the woman; but the woman through the man.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:10": "Therefore the woman ought to have power upon the head for the angels.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:11": "But neither the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:12": "For as the woman by the man, so also the man by the woman; and all things of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:13": "Judge in yourselves: is it suitable for a woman to pray to God uncovered?",
    "1 Corinthians 11:14": "Does not nature itself teach you, that, if a man truly have long hair, it is a dishonour to him?",
    "1 Corinthians 11:15": "And if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for the hair has been given her for a cloak.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:16": "And if any one seem to be loving strife, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:17": "And this announcing I approve not, that not for the better come ye together, but for the worse.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:18": "For truly first, ye coming together in the church, I hear divisions to be among you; and some part I believe.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:19": "For there must be also sects among you, that the tried might be made manifest among you.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:20": "Therefore ye coming together upon the same, it is not to eat the Lord’s supper.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:21": "For each takes his own supper in eating: and one is truly hungry, and one is intoxicated.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:22": "For, have ye not houses for eating and drinking? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them not having? What should I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise not.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:23": "For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, That the Lord Jesus, in the night which he was delivered up, took bread:",
    "1 Corinthians 11:24": "And having given thanks, he brake, and said, Take ye, eat; this is my body, broken for you: this do ye for my remembrance.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:25": "Likewise the cup also, after supping, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do ye, as often as ye drink, for my remembrance.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:26": "For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye announce the Lord’s death till he come.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:27": "Therefore whoever should eat this bread, and drink the cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be liable to the penalty of the body and blood of the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:28": "And let a man try himself, and so eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:29": "For he eating and drinking unworthily, eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:30": "For this many among you weak and sick, and enough are asleep.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:31": "For if we examined ourselves, we should not be judged.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:32": "And being judged, we are corrected of the Lord, lest we be condemned with the world.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:33": "Therefore, my brethren, coming together to eat, succeed one another.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:34": "And if any hunger, let him eat in the house; lest ye come together for judgment. And the rest when I come I will regulate.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:1": "And concerning spiritual things, brethren, I wish you not to be ignorant.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:2": "Ye know that ye were the nations, to dumb idols, as ye were led, being carried away.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:3": "Wherefore I make known to you, that none speaking in the Spirit of God calls Jesus anathema: and none can say Lord Jesus, but in the Holy Spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:4": "And there are distinctions of favors, and the same Spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:5": "And there are distinctions of services, and the same Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:6": "And there are distinctions of performances, and it is the same God performing all things in all.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:7": "And to each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for profit.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:8": "For truly to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;",
    "1 Corinthians 12:9": "And to another faith in the same Spirit; and to another graces of healings in the same Spirit;",
    "1 Corinthians 12:10": "And to another performances of powers; and to another discriminations of spirits; and to another kinds of tongues; and to another interpretation of tongues:",
    "1 Corinthians 12:11": "And all these works one and the same Spirit, dividing to each his own things as be will.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:12": "For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the one body, being many, is one body: so also is Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:13": "For also in one Spirit were we all immersed into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether servants or free; and we have all been given to drink into one Spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:14": "For also the body is not one member, but many.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:15": "If the foot say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; by this is it not of the body.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:16": "And if the ear say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; by this is it not of the body.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:17": "If the whole body an eye, where the hearing If the whole hearing, where the smelling?",
    "1 Corinthians 12:18": "And now has God set the members each one of them in the body, as he would.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:19": "And if all were one member, where the body.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:20": "And now truly many members, and one body.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:21": "The eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:22": "But much rather the members of the body, seeming to be weak, are necessary:",
    "1 Corinthians 12:23": "And what we think to be less honourable of the body, upon these we put more abundant honour; and our unseemly parts have more abundant decorum.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:24": "And our becoming parts have no need: but God blended the body together, to the wanting having given more abundant honour:",
    "1 Corinthians 12:25": "That no division be in the body; but the members should care the same for one another.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:26": "And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer together; or one member is honoured, all the members rejoice together.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:27": "And ye are the body of Christ, and members by parts.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:28": "And whom truly God set in the church, first the sent, second the prophets, third teachers, then powers, then graces of healings, helps, directions, kinds of tongues.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:29": "Not all sent: not all prophets: not all teachers: not all powers:",
    "1 Corinthians 12:30": "All have not the favors of healing: not all speaking with tongues: not all interpret accurately.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:31": "And be emulous of the better favors: and yet I shew you a way according to eminence.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:1": "If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I have been the brass of echoes, and the shouting cymbal.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:2": "And if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries, and all knowledge; and if I have all faith to remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:3": "And if I feed out all my goods, and if I deliver my body that I be burned, and have not love, I am profited nothing.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:4": "Love is slow to anger, possesses kindness; love envies not; love vaunts not itself, is not puffed up,",
    "1 Corinthians 13:5": "It demeans itself not unbecomingly, seeks not the things of itself, is not irritated, reckons no evil;",
    "1 Corinthians 13:6": "Rejoices not at injustice, and rejoices with the truth;",
    "1 Corinthians 13:7": "Covers all things, believes all, hopes all things, endures all.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:8": "Love never falters: but whether gifts of prophecies, they shall be left unemployed; whether tongues, they shall cease; whether knowledge, it shall be left unemployed.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:9": "For we know by parts, and we prophesy by parts.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:10": "And when the perfected come, then shall that by parts be left unemployed.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:11": "When I was a child, as a child I spake, as a child I thought, as a child I reckoned: and when I had become a man, I left unemployed the things of a child.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:12": "For now we see by a mirror in an enigma; then face to face: now I know by parts; and then shall I know as I was known.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:13": "And now remains faith, hope, love, these three; and the greater of these, love.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:1": "Pursue love, and be emulous of spiritual things, and rather that ye might prophesy.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:2": "For he speaking in a tongue speaks not to men, but to God: (for none hears; and in the spirit he speaks mysteries.)",
    "1 Corinthians 14:3": "And he prophesying speaks to men for building the house, and entreaty, and encouragement.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:4": "And he speaking in a tongue builds himself; and he prophesying builds the church.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:5": "And I will ye all to speak with tongues, and rather that ye prophesy; for greater he prophesying, than he speaking with tongues, unless he interpret accurately, that the church receive building up.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:6": "And now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in teaching?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:7": "As inanimate things giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if it give not a distinction to sounds, how shall the piping or harping be known?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:8": "For also if the trumpet give an uncertain voice, who shall prepare himself for war?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:9": "So also ye, except by the tongue ye give an evident word, how shall the speaking be known? for ye shall be speaking into the air.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:10": "If perchance, such kind of voices be in the world, and none of them speechless.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:11": "If therefore I know not the power of the voice, I shall be to him speaking a foreigner, and he speaking a foreigner to me.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:12": "So also ye, since ye are zealous of spirits, for the building up of the church seek that ye may abound.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:13": "Wherefore he speaking in a tongue, let, him pray that he might interpret.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:14": "For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, and my mind is unfruitful.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:15": "What therefore is it? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray also with the mind: I will play on the harp in the spirit, and I will play also on the harp in the mind.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:16": "When if thou praise in the spirit, how shall he filling the place of the private individual say Amen at thy thanksgiving) since he knows not what thou sayest.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:17": "For thou truly givest thanks well, but the other is not built up.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:18": "I thank my God, speaking in tongues more than you all:",
    "1 Corinthians 14:19": "But in the church, I will to speak five words by my mind, that I might also sound in the ears of others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:20": "Brethren, be not children in reflection: but in wickedness act like children, and in reflection be ye perfected.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:21": "It has been written in the law, That in other tongues and in other lips will I speak to this people; and not so will they hear me, says the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:22": "So that tongues are for a sign, not to the believing, but to the unbelieving: and the gift of prophecy, not to the unbelieving, but to the believing.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:23": "If therefore the whole church come together upon the same, and all speak with tongues, and the private individual, or unbelieving, come in, will they not say that ye are enraged?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:24": "And If all prophesy, and any unbelieving, or ignorant private individual come in, he is refuted by all, he is examined by all:",
    "1 Corinthians 14:25": "And so the hidden things of his heart are made manifest; and so having fallen upon the face, he will worship God, proclaiming that God is truly with you.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:26": "Therefore, what is it brethren when ye come together, every one of you has a Psalms, has teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretatior. Let all things be for the building of the house.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:27": "Whether any speak in a tongue, by two, or the most by three, and in part; and let one interpret.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:28": "And if there be no interpreter, let him be silent in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:29": "And let the prophets speak two or three, and let others decide.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:30": "And if to another sitting by it be revealed, let the first be silent.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:31": "For ye are all able to prophesy one by one, that all might learn, and all might be encouraged.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:32": "And the spirits of the prophets are subjected to the prophets.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:33": "For God is not of unsteadiness, but of peace, as in all the churches of the holy ones.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:34": "Let your women be silent in the churches: for it has not been committed to them to speak; but to be subjected, as also says the law.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:35": "And if they will learn anything, let them ask their own husbands in the house; for it is shameful for women to speak in the church.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:36": "Or came out the word of God from you or did it arrive to you only?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:37": "If any think to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him observe what I write to you, that they are the commands of the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:38": "And if any is ignorant, let him be ignorant.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:39": "Therefore, brethren, be zealous to prophesy, and hinder not to speak in tongues.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:40": "Let all things be becomingly and according to order.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:1": "And I make known to you, brethren, the good news which I announced to you, which also ye received, and in which ye stood;",
    "1 Corinthians 15:2": "By which also ye are saved, to which word I announced to you if ye hold, unless ye believed to no purpose.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:3": "For I delivered to you among the first, what I also received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the writings;",
    "1 Corinthians 15:4": "And that he was buried, and that he was raised the third day, according to the writings.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:5": "And that he was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve:",
    "1 Corinthians 15:6": "Then was he seen by above five hundred brethren once for all; of whom the most remain till now, and some also are laid to rest.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:7": "Then was he seen by James; then by all the sent.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:8": "And last of all exactly as an abortive, was he also seen by me.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:9": "For I am the least of the sent, who am not fit to be called sent, for I drove out the church of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:10": "And by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which in me was not vain; but I was more abundantly wearied than they all: and not I, but the grace of God which with me.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:11": "Whether therefore I or they, so we proclaim, and so ye believed.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:12": "And if Christ is proclaimed that he arose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no rising up of the dead?",
    "1 Corinthians 15:13": "And if there is no rising up of the dead, neither has Christ risen:",
    "1 Corinthians 15:14": "And if Christ has not risen, then our proclaiming vain, and also your faith vain.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:15": "And we are also found false witnesses of God; for we testified for God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not, if therefore the dead are not raised.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:16": "For if the dead are not raised, neither was Christ raised up:",
    "1 Corinthians 15:17": "And if Christ was not raised up, your faith is vain; yet are ye in your sins.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:18": "Then they also having died in Christ perished.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:19": "If in this life only we have been hoping in Christ, we are more to be compassionated than all men.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:20": "And now Was Christ raised from the dead, he was the first fruits of those having died.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:21": "For since by man death, also by man the rising up of the dead.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:22": "For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:23": "And each in his own order: the first fruit Christ; then they of Christ in his arrival.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:24": "Then the end, when he should deliver up the kingdom to God, and the Father; when he should leave unemployed every beginning and every authority and power.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:25": "For he must reign, till he put all enemies under his feet.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:26": "The last enemy, death, is left unemployed.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:27": "For he subjected all things under his feet. And when he said that all things have been subjected, it is manifest that without him having subjected all things to him.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:28": "And when all things be subjected to him, then also shall the Son himself be subjected to him having made all things subject to him, that God might be all things in all.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:29": "For what shall they do being immersed for the dead, if in fine the dead rise not? and why are they immersed for the dead?",
    "1 Corinthians 15:30": "And why are we in peril every hour?",
    "1 Corinthians 15:31": "In the day I die by: your boasting which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:32": "If according to man I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what the profit to me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:33": "Be not deceived: evil intercourses corrupt good habits.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:34": "Recover your senses rightly, and in not; for some have a want of knowledge of God: I speak to your confusion.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:35": "But some one will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?",
    "1 Corinthians 15:36": "Froth, what thou sowest is not made alive, except it die:",
    "1 Corinthians 15:37": "And what thou sowest, thou sowest not the body going to be, but the naked kernel, if perhaps of wheat, or some of the rest:",
    "1 Corinthians 15:38": "And God gives it a body as he would, and to each of the seed its own body.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:39": "Not all flesh the same flesh: but one truly flesh of men, and another of cattle, and another of fishes, and another of flying things.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:40": "And celestial bodies, and terrestrial bodies: but truly one the glory of the celestial, and another that of the terrestrial.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:41": "One glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for star differs from star in glory.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:42": "So also the rising up of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:",
    "1 Corinthians 15:43": "It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:",
    "1 Corinthians 15:44": "It is sown an animated body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is an animated body, and there is a spiritual body.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:45": "So also has been written, The first man Adam was born into a living soul; and the last Adam into a spirit making alive.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:46": "But the first not spiritual, but animated; then the spiritual.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:47": "The first man of earth, made of earth: the second man the Lord from heaven.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:48": "As the made of earth, such also the made of earth: and as the celestial, such also the celestial.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:49": "And as we have borne the image of the made of earth, we shall also bear the image of the celestial.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:50": "And this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:51": "Behold, I speak to you a mystery; We truly shall not all be laid asleep, but we shall all be changed,",
    "1 Corinthians 15:52": "In an atom, in the twinkling of the eye, in the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:53": "For this corrupted must put on incorruption, and this mortal put on immortality.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:54": "And when this corrupted shall put on incorruption, and this mortal shall put on immortality, then shall be the word written, Death was swallowed down in victory.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:55": "Where thine, death, the sting? where thine, hades, the victory.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:56": "And the sting of death sin; and the power of sin the law.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:57": "And grace to God, giving us the victory by our Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:58": "Wherefore, my beloved brethren, be stable, unmoved, abounding in the work of the Lord always, knowing that our fatigue is not in vain in the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:1": "And concerning the collection for the holy ones, as I appointed to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:2": "According to one day of the sabbaths let each of you put by himself, treasuring up that which he is prospered in, that when I come there be no collections.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:3": "And when I be present, whom ye approve by letters, these will I send to carry your grace to Jerusalem.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:4": "And if it be suitable for me also to go, they shall go with me.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:5": "And I will come to you, when I pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:6": "And perhaps with you I shall abide, or also pass the winter, that ye might send me forward wherever I go.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:7": "For I will not see you now in coming forward; but I hope to remain some time with you, if the Lord permit.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:8": "And I will remain in Ephesus even till Pentecost.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:9": "For a door has stood open to me, great and effective, and many opposed.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:10": "And if Timotheus come, see ye that he be with you fearlessly: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:11": "Therefore no one should despise him: and send ye him forward in peace, that he might come to me: for I expect him with the brethren.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:12": "And concerning Apollos, the brother, I besought him much that he would come to you with the brethren: and the will was not altogether that he should come now; and he will come when he should have leisure.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:13": "Watch ye, stand in the faith, be manly, be strengthened.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:14": "Let all things be in love.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:15": "And I beseech you brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and they arranged themselves for service to the holy ones,)",
    "1 Corinthians 16:16": "That also ye be subjected to such, and to every one cooperating, and to the wearied.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:17": "And I rejoice at the arrival of Stephanas and Fortunatus and: that they have filled up your necessity.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:18": "For they refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore observe ye such.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:19": "The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla, with the church at their house, greet you.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:20": "All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with a holy kiss.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:21": "The greeting of Paul by my hand.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:22": "If any love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:23": "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ with you:",
    "1 Corinthians 16:24": "My love with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:1": "Paul, sent of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and brother Timothy, to the church of God being in Corinth, with all holy ones being in the whole of Achaia:",
    "2 Corinthians 1:2": "Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:3": "Praised the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion, and God of all comfort:",
    "2 Corinthians 1:4": "Who comforting us upon all our pressure, that we may be able to comfort them in every pressure, by the comfort by which we ourselves are comforted by God.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:5": "For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so by Christ abounds also our comfort.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:6": "And whether we are pressed, for your comfort and salvation, being well wrought in endurance of the same sufferings which we also suffer: whether we are comforted, for your comfort and salvation.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:7": "And our hope firm for you, knowing, that as ye are participators of the sufferings, so also of the comfort.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:8": "For we wish you not to be ignorant, brethren, of our pressure having been to us in Asia, that we were exceedingly loaded, above strength, so that we were in utter perplexity even to live:",
    "2 Corinthians 1:9": "And we ourselves have had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not have trusted in ourselves, but in God raising the dead:",
    "2 Corinthians 1:10": "Who saved us from so great a death, and does save: in whom we have hoped also that he will yet save;",
    "2 Corinthians 1:11": "And ye serving together for us in prayer, that of many faces, the favor to us by many thanks be returned by us.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:12": "For our boasting is this, the testimony of our consciousness, that in simplicity and purity of God, not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God, we turned back in the world, and more eminently to you.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:13": "For we write no others to you, but what ye either know or also observe; and I hope that also even to the end ye will observe;",
    "2 Corinthians 1:14": "As also ye observed us by part, that we are your boast, as also ye ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:15": "And in this confidence I wished to come to you before, that ye might have a second grace;",
    "2 Corinthians 1:16": "And by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia, to come to you, and by you to be sent forward to Judea.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:17": "Therefore I resolved this, much less did I use levity: or what I resolve, do I resolve according to the flesh, that there be with me yea, yea, and nay, nay.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:18": "And God faithful, for our word to you was not yea or nay.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:19": "For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who proclaimed in you by us, by me, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but was yea in him.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:20": "Forasmuch as the solemn promises of God in him yea, and in him Amen, for glory to God by us.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:21": "And he making us firm with you in Christ, and having anointed us, is God;",
    "2 Corinthians 1:22": "Who also having sealed us, and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:23": "And I call upon God a witness upon my soul, that, sparing you, I came no more to Corinth.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:24": "Not that we are masters of your faith, but we are aiders of your joy: for ye have stood in the faith.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:1": "And I determined this to myself, not to come to you again in sadness.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:2": "For if I grieve you, and who is he making me glad, except he being grieved by me.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:3": "And I wrote this same to you lest, coming, I should have sadness from whom I ought to rejoice, trusting to you all, that mine is the joy of you all.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:4": "For out of much pressure and anxiety of heart I wrote to you through many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love I have more abundantly towards you.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:5": "And if any have grieved, he has not grieved me, but by part; that I might not overload you all.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:6": "Sufficient to such a one this enjoyment of the esteem of the many.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:7": "So that on the contrary ye should rather show kindness, and console, lest perhaps such be swallowed down with more abundant sadness.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:8": "Wherefore I beseech you to confirm love to him.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:9": "For, for this I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, if ye are obedient for all things.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:10": "And to whom ye show any favor; I also: for also if I have shown any kindness, to whom I have shown kindness, through you in the face of Christ;",
    "2 Corinthians 2:11": "That we might not be taken advantage of by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his inventions.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:12": "And coming to Troas for the good news of Christ, and a door having been opened to me in the Lord,",
    "2 Corinthians 2:13": "I have had no relaxation to my spirit, in my not finding Titus my brother: but having taken leave of them, I went out to Macedonia.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:14": "Grace to God, always leading us to triumph in Christ, and making manifest the order of his knowledge by us in every place.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:15": "For we are to God a sweet odor of Christ, in the saved, and in the host:",
    "2 Corinthians 2:16": "Truly to those an odor of death into death; and to those an odor of life into life. And who sufficient for these things?",
    "2 Corinthians 2:17": "For we are not as the many adulterating the word of God: but as of purity, but as of God, before the face of God speak we in Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:1": "Begin we again to recommend ourselves or need we not, as some; recommendatory epistles to you, or recommendatory from you?",
    "2 Corinthians 3:2": "Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and acknowledged by all men:",
    "2 Corinthians 3:3": "Made manifest that ye are the epistle of Christ served by us, not written with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables made of stone, but in fleshly tables of the heart.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:4": "And we have such confidence through Christ to God:",
    "2 Corinthians 3:5": "Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to reckon anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency of God;",
    "2 Corinthians 3:6": "Who rendered as fitting servants of the new covenant; not of the letter, but of the Spirit: for the letter kills, and the Spirit makes alive.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:7": "And if the service of death, in letters imprinted in stones, was in glory, so that the sons of Israel could not look intently to the face of Moses for the glory of his face; being left unemployed.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:8": "How shall not rather the service of the Spirit be in glory?",
    "2 Corinthians 3:9": "For if the service of condemnation glory, much more the service of justice abounds in glory.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:10": "For also that having been glorified has not been glorified in this part, for sake of the glory excelling.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:11": "For if that left unemployed by glory, much more that remaining in glory.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:12": "Therefore having such hope, we use much freedom of speech:",
    "2 Corinthians 3:13": "And not as Moses put a veil upon his face, that the sons of Israel should not look intently to the end of that left unemployed:",
    "2 Corinthians 3:14": "But their minds were hardened: for until this day the same veil upon the reading of the old covenant remains not uncovered; for in Christ it is left unemployed.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:15": "But even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies upon their heart.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:16": "And whenever it turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:17": "And the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord, there freedom.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:18": "And we all, shown as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, with the face uncovered, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as from the Spirit of the Lord.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:1": "For this, having this service, as we were compassionated, we lose not courage;",
    "2 Corinthians 4:2": "But have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craft, neither adulterating the word of God; but by manifestation of the truth recommending ourselves to every consciousness of man before God.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:3": "And if also our good news is hid, in the lost is it hid:",
    "2 Corinthians 4:4": "In whom the God of this world blinded the minds of the unbelieving, so that the enlightening of the good news of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, does not enlighten them.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:5": "For we proclaim not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:6": "For God, having spoken light to shine out of darkness, who shone in our hearts, to the enlightening of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:7": "And we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the eminence of power be of God, and not of us.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:8": "Being pressed in every thing, but not straightened; being at a loss, but not utterly perplexed;",
    "2 Corinthians 4:9": "Being driven out, but not forsaken; being cast down, but not destroyed;",
    "2 Corinthians 4:10": "Always bearing about in the body the death of the Lord Jesus, that also the life of Jesus be made manifest in our body.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:11": "For we, the living, are always delivered to death for Jesus, that also the life of Jesus be made manifest in our mortal flesh.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:12": "So that death is truly energetic in us, and life in you.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:13": "And having the same spirit of faith, according to that written, I believed, therefore I spake: and we believe, and therefore we speak;",
    "2 Corinthians 4:14": "Knowing that he having raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us by Jesus, and present us with you.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:15": "For all things for you, that grace, having abounded by the many, might abound in thanksgiving to the glory of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:16": "Wherefore we lose not courage; but if also our man without is destroyed, but he within is renewed day and day.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:17": "For the present moment the lightness of our pressure works to us an eternal weight of glory, as eminence upon eminence;",
    "2 Corinthians 4:18": "We looking not at things seen, but at things not seen: for things seen, temporary; and things not seen, eternal.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:1": "For we know that if our earthly house of the tent were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:2": "For also in this we groan, longing to have our dwelling from heaven put on:",
    "2 Corinthians 5:3": "If also being even clothed we shall not be found naked.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:4": "For also being in the tent we groan, being loaded: since we wish not to be unclothed, but to be clothed, that the mortal should be swallowed up of life.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:5": "And he having brought us about to this same, God, he having also given us the pledge of the Spirit.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:6": "Therefore being always confident, and knowing that, being at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:",
    "2 Corinthians 5:7": "(For we walk by faith, and not by external appearance:)",
    "2 Corinthians 5:8": "And we are confident, and are contented rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home in the Lord.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:9": "Wherefore also let us seek the honour, whether being at home, whether being absent, to be pleasing to him.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:10": "For we must all be made manifest before the judgment seat of Christ; that each might receive the things for the body, for what he did, good or bad.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:11": "Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men; and we are made manifest to God; and I hope also to have been made manifest to your consciences.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:12": "For not again do we recommend ourselves to you, but giving you occasion for boasting over us, that ye might have for them boasting in face, and not in heart.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:13": "For whether we be beside ourselves, to God: or be of sound mind, to you.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:14": "For the love of Christ holds us together; having judged this, that if one died for all, then all dead:",
    "2 Corinthians 5:15": "And he died for all, that the living no more live to themselves, but to him having died for them, and having risen.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:16": "So that we from now know none according to the flesh: and if also we have known Christ according to the flesh, but now we know no more.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:17": "So that if any in Christ, a new creation: old things have passed away; behold, all have become new.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:18": "And all things of God, having reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and given us the service of reconciliation;",
    "2 Corinthians 5:19": "For as God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their faults; and having set in us the word of reconciliation.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:20": "For Christ therefore are we ambassadors, as of God beseeching by us: we pray for the sake of Christ, be ye reconciled to God.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:21": "For him not knowing sin, he made sin for us; that we might be the justice of God in him.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:1": "And working together, we also beseech, lest also ye receive the grace of God in vain.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:2": "(For he says, In an acceptable time I listened to thee, and in the day of salvation have I run to succor thee: behold, now the acceptable time; behold; now the day of salvation.)",
    "2 Corinthians 6:3": "Giving no offence in any thing, that the service be not blamed:",
    "2 Corinthians 6:4": "But in every thing recommending ourselves as servants of God, in much patience, in pressures, in necessities, in extremities,",
    "2 Corinthians 6:5": "In blows, in imprisonments, in disorders, in fatigues, in watchings, in fastings;",
    "2 Corinthians 6:6": "In purity, in knowledge, in long suffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:7": "In the word of truth, in the power of God, through the weapons of justice of the right hands and the left,",
    "2 Corinthians 6:8": "Through glory and ignominy, through slander and applause: as erring, and true;",
    "2 Corinthians 6:9": "As being ignorant, and knowing; as dying, and, behold, we live; as being disciplined, and not killed;",
    "2 Corinthians 6:10": "As being grieved, and always rejoicing; as poor, and making many rich; as having nothing, and possessing all things.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:11": "Our month stands open to you, O Corinthians, our heart has been enlarged.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:12": "Ye are not contracted in us, but ye are contracted in your bowels.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:13": "And for the same recompense, (I speak as to children,) be ye yourselves also enlarged.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:14": "Be not unequally yoked together with the unbelieving: for what participation to justice and iniquity and what communion to light with darkness?",
    "2 Corinthians 6:15": "And what conformity to Christ with Belial? and what part to the believing with the unbelieving?",
    "2 Corinthians 6:16": "And what agreement to the temple of God with images? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God said, That I will dwell in them, and will go round about; and will be their God, and they shall be a people to me.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:17": "Therefore come out from the midst of them, and be separated, says the Lord, and touch not the unclean; and I will receive you.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:18": "And I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:1": "Therefore having these declarations, dearly let us cleanse ourselves from all defilements of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:2": "Receive us; we injured none, we corrupted none, we took advantage of none.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:3": "I speak not to condemnation: for I have said before, ye are in our hearts to die together, and live together.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:4": "Much freedom of speech to me toward you; to me much boasting over you: I am filled with consolation, I superabound in joy in all your pressure.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:5": "For also, we having come to Macedonia, our flesh had no relaxation, but pressed in everything; without conflicts, within fears.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:6": "But God, comforting the humble, comforted us in the arrival of Titus;",
    "2 Corinthians 7:7": "And not only in his arrival, but also in the comfort which he was comforted in you, announcing to us your anxious desire, your lamentations, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced the more.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:8": "For if I also grieved you in the epistle, I regret not, and if I did regret: for I see that that epistle, if also for a time, grieved you.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:9": "Now I rejoice, not that ye were grieved, but that ye were grieved to repentance: for ye were grieved according to God, that ye be injured in nothing by us.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:10": "For grief according to God works repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but grief of the world works death.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:11": "For behold, this same that ye grieve according to God, what care it wrought in you, but defence, but indignation, but fear, but anxious desire, but zeal, but punishing! In every thing ye recommended yourselves to be holy in this affair.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:12": "Wherefore, if I also wrote to you, not for him having been unjust, for him having suffered injustice, but that your care for us might be made manifest to you before God.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:13": "Therefore have we been comforted in your comfort: and we rejoiced more abundantly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed from you all.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:14": "For if I have boasted anything to him of you, I was not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, so also was our boasting over Titus the truth.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:15": "And his bowels are more abundantly to you, remembering the obedience of you all, how with fear and tremor ye received him.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:16": "I rejoice that I place confidence in you in everything.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:1": "And we make known to you, brethren, the grace of God given in the churches of Macedonia;",
    "2 Corinthians 8:2": "That in much proof of pressure the abundance of their joy and their poverty according to depth abounded to the abundance of their simplicity.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:3": "For according to power, I testify, and above power chosen voluntarily;",
    "2 Corinthians 8:4": "Praying us with much entreaty that we receive the grace and participation of the service for saints.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:5": "And not as we hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord, and to us by the will of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:6": "So that we besought Titus, that as he began before, so also he would complete to us this grace also.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:7": "But as ye abound in everything, in faith, and in word, and in knowledge, and in all care, and in love from you to us, that also ye abound in this grace.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:8": "I speak not according to command, but by care of others, trying also the purity of your love.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:9": "For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that for you he was in a state of beggary, being rich; that ye in his poverty might be rich.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:10": "And in this I give an opinion: for this is profitable to you, which no only to do, but to will, ye began before from last year.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:11": "And now also complete ye the doing; that as a forwardness to will so also to complete, out of what is possessed.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:12": "For if a forwardness lie before, according as any has, it is acceptable, not as he has not.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:13": "For not that ease to others, and pressure to you:",
    "2 Corinthians 8:14": "But of equality, now in this time your abundance for their want, that also their abundance be for your want: that there be equality:",
    "2 Corinthians 8:15": "As has been written, He to whom much, was not in excess; and he to whom little, was not diminished.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:16": "And grace to God, having given the same care for you in the heart of Titus.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:17": "For truly he received the entreaty; and being more earnest, he went forth voluntarily to you.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:18": "And we sent with him the brother whose approbation in the good news through all the churches;",
    "2 Corinthians 8:19": "And not only, but also the hand stretched out by the churches for our fellow-traveler with this grace, served by us to the glory of the same Lord, and to your forwardness:",
    "2 Corinthians 8:20": "Prepared for this, lest any blame us in this abundance served by us:",
    "2 Corinthians 8:21": "Providing good things beforehand, not only before the Lord, but also before men.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:22": "And we sent with them our brother, whom we proved in many things being earnest many times, and now much more earnest, with much confidence in you.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:23": "Whether for Titus, my companion and co-worker to you: or our brethren, the sent of the churches, the glory of Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:24": "Therefore the manifestations of your love, and of your boasting for us, shew ye to them, and to the face of the churches.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:1": "For truly, concerning the service to the holy ones, it is superfluous for me to write to you:",
    "2 Corinthians 9:2": "For I know your forwardness, which I boast of for you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was prepared from last year; and zeal from you excited the many more.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:3": "And I sent the brethren, lest our boasting for you be empty in this part; that, as I said, ye might be prepared:",
    "2 Corinthians 9:4": "Lest if in some way the Macedonians come with me, and find you unprepared, we should be ashamed, (that we should not say, ye) in this principle of boasting.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:5": "Therefore I thought necessary to beseech the brethren that they go before to you, and prepare beforehand your praise, having been proclaimed beforehand, this same to be prepared, so as praise, and not as covetousness.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:6": "And this, He sowing sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he sowing in praises shall reap also in praises.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:7": "Each as he chooses in the heart; not of grief, or of necessity: for God loves a cheerful giver.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:8": "And God able for all grace to abound in you; having always all sufficiency in everything, ye abound in every good work:",
    "2 Corinthians 9:9": "(As has been written, He scattered; he gave to the poor: his justice remains forever.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:10": "And now he furnishing seed to him sowing, and bread for food, furnish and multiply your sowing-season, and increase the fruits of your justice;)",
    "2 Corinthians 9:11": "Enriched in everything in all simplicity, which works through us gratitude to God.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:12": "For the service of this office is not only filling up the wants of the saints, but also abounding through many thanks to God;",
    "2 Corinthians 9:13": "By the proof of this service honouring God for the subjection of your assent to the good news of Christ, and to the simplicity of mutual participation to them and to all;",
    "2 Corinthians 9:14": "And by their prayer for you, longing for you through the exceeding grace of God upon you.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:15": "And grace to God for his indescribable gift.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:1": "And I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and equity of Christ, who, in face truly low with you, but at a distance bold towards you:",
    "2 Corinthians 10:2": "And I pray, being present, not to be bold with the confidence which I reckon to encounter against certain, reckoning us as walking about according to the flesh.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:3": "For walking in the flesh, we war not after the flesh:",
    "2 Corinthians 10:4": "(For the weapons of our warfare not fleshly, but powerful to God to the taking down of fortified places;)",
    "2 Corinthians 10:5": "Taking down reckonings, and every elevation lifted up against the knowledge of God, and taking captive every thought to the obedience of Christ;",
    "2 Corinthians 10:6": "And having in readiness to avenge every imperfect instruction, when your obedience should be completed.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:7": "See ye things according to the face? If any has persuaded himself to be of Christ, let him reckon this again of himself, that, as he of Christ, so we also of Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:8": "For if I also boast something more abundantly of our power, which the Lord gave us for the building up, and not for your taking down, I shall not be ashamed:",
    "2 Corinthians 10:9": "Lest I seem as terrifying you by epistles.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:10": "(For truly the epistles, he says, weighty and strong; but the presence of the body weak, and the word counted as nothing.)",
    "2 Corinthians 10:11": "Let such a one reckon this, that, such as we are in the word by the epistles, being away, such also, being present, in deed.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:12": "For we dare not appear or join ourselves to certain of them recommending themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and joining themselves to themselves, do not understand.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:13": "And we boast not of things immeasurable, but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure divided to us, to reach even also to you.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:14": "For not as reaching to you we stretch beyond ourselves: for also even to you we came before in the good news of Christ:",
    "2 Corinthians 10:15": "Not boasting in things immeasurable, in the toils of others; and having hope, your faith being increased, to be enlarged in you according to our rule for abundance,",
    "2 Corinthians 10:16": "To announce the good hews in things beyond you, not in another’s rule to boast for things prepared.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:17": "But he boasting, let him boast in the Lord.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:18": "For not he recommending himself, this is acceptable, but whom the Lord recommends.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:1": "I would ye hold me up a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:2": "For I am zealous of you with the zeal of God: for I fitted you to one husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:3": "And I am afraid lest, as the serpent completely deceived Eve in his craft, so your thoughts be corrupted from the simplicity which in Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:4": "For if he coming proclaim another Jesus, which I proclaimed not, or ye receive another spirit, which ye received not, or other good news, which ye received not, ye have held up well.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:5": "For I reckon myself to be nothing greatly inferior to the sent.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:6": "And, if also ignorant in the word, but not in knowledge; but in every thing, we having been made manifest in all for you.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:7": "Or did I a sin, humbling myself that ye might be exalted, because I announced to you the good news of God gratuitously?",
    "2 Corinthians 11:8": "I stripped other churches, having received pay, for your service.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:9": "And being present with you, and having wanted, I acted not with negligence to any: (for the brethren having come from Macedonia filled up still more my want:) and I kept myself in every thing not burdensome to you, and I will keep.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:10": "The truth of Christ is in me, for this boasting shall not be shut up in me in the regions of Achaia.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:11": "Wherefore? because I love you not? God knows.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:12": "And what I do, and I will do, that I shall not cut off the occasion of those wishing the occasion; that in what they boast, they be found as also we.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:13": "For such the falsely sent, crafty workers, being transformed into the sent of Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:14": "And not wonderful; for Satan himself is transformed into a messenger of light.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:15": "No great thing therefore if also his servants are transformed as servants of justice; whose end shall be according to their works.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:16": "Again I say, lest any one should think me to be mad; and if not so indeed, as mad do ye receive me that I might also boast myself some little.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:17": "What I speak, I speak not according to the Lord, but as in madness, in this first principle of boasting.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:18": "Since many boast according to the flesh, I shall also boast.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:19": "For ye bear with the mad willingly, being wise.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:20": "For ye bear, if any reduce you to bondage, if any devour, if any receive, if any be lifted up, if any skin you on the face.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:21": "I speak according to dishonour, as that we were weak. And in what any dares, (I speak in rashness,) I dare also.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:22": "Are they Hebrews? I also. Are they Israelites? I also. Are they Abraham’s seed? I also.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:23": "Are they Christ’s servants? (I speak being light-headed) I above; in toils more abundant, in blows more excessively, in watchings more abundantly, in deaths often.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:24": "Of the Jews five times I received forty, except one.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:25": "Thrice was I scourged with rods, once was I stoned, thrice suffered I shipwreck, I have made a night and day in the deep;",
    "2 Corinthians 11:26": "In journeys often, in dangers of rivers, in dangers of robbers, in dangers of the family, in dangers from the nations, in dangers in the city, in dangers in solitude, in dangers in the sea, in dangers with false brethren;",
    "2 Corinthians 11:27": "In fatigue and toil, in watchfulnesses often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:28": "Besides things outside, my distraction daily, the care of all the churches.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:29": "Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I am not inflamed.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:30": "If I must boast, I will boast things of my weakness.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:31": "God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ knows, he being praised forever, that I lie not.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:32": "In Damascus king Aretas’ governor watched the city of the Damascenes, wishing to seize me.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:33": "And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and I escaped from his hands.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:1": "Indeed it is not profitable to me to boast. For I will come to visions and Revelation of the Lord.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:2": "I knew a man in Christ before fourteen years, (whether in the body, I know not; whether out of the body, I know not: God knows;) such a one having been carried off even to the third heaven.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:3": "And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, whether out of the body, I know not: God knows;)",
    "2 Corinthians 12:4": "That he was carried off into paradise, and heard words not to be told, which it was not permitted man to speak.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:5": "Of such a one will I boast: and of myself I will not boast, except in my weakness.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:6": "For if I be willing to boast, I shall not be mad; for the truth will I say: and I spare, lest any reckon for me above what he sees me, or what he hears of me.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:7": "And lest I be lifted up by the eminence of Revelation, a thorn in the flesh was given me, a messenger of Satan, that he might cuff me, lest I be lifted up.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:8": "For this thrice besought I the Lord, that it remove away from me.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:9": "And he said to me, My grace suffices thee: for my power is perfected in weakness. Therefore very willingly will I boast rather in my weaknesses, that Christ’s power may lodge upon me.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:10": "Therefore am I contented in weaknesses, in reproaches, in necessities in expulsions, in extremities for Christ: for when I am weak, then am I strong.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:11": "I have been mad boasting; ye forced me: for I ought to have been recommended by you: for I was not greatly inferior to the sent, if also I am nothing.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:12": "Surely the signs of one sent was wrought in you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and powers.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:13": "For what is it which ye were inferior to the rest of the churches, except that I myself acted not with negligence to you? favor me for this injustice.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:14": "Behold, I have prepared to come to you the third time; and I will not act with negligence to you: for I seek not your things, but you: for children ought not to treasure up for parents, but parents for children.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:15": "And I very willingly will expend and be expended for your souls; if also loving you more abundantly, the less I should be loved.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:16": "And let it be, I overloaded you not: but being dexterous, I took you by contrivance.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:17": "Not any of whom I have sent to you have I by him taken advantage of you.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:18": "I called for Titus, and sent with a brother. Has Titus taken advantage of you? walked we not in the same spirit? not in the same steps?",
    "2 Corinthians 12:19": "Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves to you? before God in Christ we speak: and all things, beloved, for your building up.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:20": "For I am afraid, lest somehow, having come, I find you not such; as I will, and I find you such as ye wish not: lest somehow, strifes, jealousies, wraths, intrigues, calumnies, whisperings, inflations, derangements:",
    "2 Corinthians 12:21": "Lest, coming again, my God should humble me with you, and I shall mourn for many of them having sinned before, and not having repented for uncleanness, and fornication, and licentiousness which they committed.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:1": "This third I come to you. By mouth of two witnesses, and three, shall every word be established.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:2": "I have said before, and say beforehand, as being present the second; and being away now I write to them having sinned before, and to all the rest, that, if I should come again, I will not spare:",
    "2 Corinthians 13:3": "Since seek proof of Christ speaking in me, who to you is no weak, but has power in you.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:4": "For also if he was crucified from weakness, but he lives from the power of God. For also we are weak in him, but we live with him from the power of God to you.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:5": "Try yourselves, if ye are in the faith; prove yourselves. Or know ye not yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless ye are not tried?",
    "2 Corinthians 13:6": "And I hope that ye shall know that we are not untried.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:7": "And I pray to God that ye do nothing evil; not that we appear tried, but that ye do good, and we be as untried.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:8": "For we are not able anything against the truth, but for the truth.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:9": "For we rejoice when we be weak, and ye be able: and this also we pray, your restoration.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:10": "For this I write these things being absent, that being present I should not wound severely, according to the power which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for pulling down.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:11": "As to the rest, brethren, rejoice. Be adjusted, be comforted, think the same, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall with you.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:12": "Greet ye one another in a holy kiss.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:13": "All the holy ones greet you.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:14": "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit with you all. Amen.",
    "Galatians 1:1": "Paul, sent, (not from men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, having raised him from the dead;)",
    "Galatians 1:2": "And with me all the brethren, to the churches of Galatia:",
    "Galatians 1:3": "Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,",
    "Galatians 1:4": "Having given himself for our sins, that he might take us away out of this present evil time, according to the will of God and our Father:",
    "Galatians 1:5": "To whom the glory for the time of times. Amen.",
    "Galatians 1:6": "I wonder that so quickly are ye transferred from him having called you by the grace of Christ to another good news:",
    "Galatians 1:7": "Which is not another; except some are troubling you, and wishing to pervert the good news of Christ.",
    "Galatians 1:8": "But also if we, or a messenger from heaven, announce good news to you, more than what: we have announced to you, let him be anathema.",
    "Galatians 1:9": "As we said before, also now say I again, If any announce to you good news above what ye received, let him be anathema.",
    "Galatians 1:10": "For now do I persuade men, or God? or seek I to please men? for if I had yet pleased men, I should not have been the servant of Christ.",
    "Galatians 1:11": "But I make known to you, brethren, the good news announced by me that it is not according to man.",
    "Galatians 1:12": "For I neither received it from man, neither was I taught, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.",
    "Galatians 1:13": "For ye heard of my turning about when in Judaism, that in excess I drove out the church of God, and laid it waste:",
    "Galatians 1:14": "And I advanced in Judaism above many like in my race, being more abundantly zealous of paternal traditions.",
    "Galatians 1:15": "And when God was contented, having separated me from my mother’s womb, and having called me, by his grace,",
    "Galatians 1:16": "To reveal his Son in me, that I might announce him the good news in the nations; I consulted not with flesh and blood:",
    "Galatians 1:17": "Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them sent before me; but I went away to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus.",
    "Galatians 1:18": "Then after three years I came up to Jerusalem to examine Peter, and remained with him fifteen days.",
    "Galatians 1:19": "And other of the sect I saw not, except James the Lord’s brother.",
    "Galatians 1:20": "And what I write to you, behold, before God, that I lie not.",
    "Galatians 1:21": "Then came I to the regions of Syria and Cilicia;",
    "Galatians 1:22": "And was unknown by face to the churches of Judea there in Christ.",
    "Galatians 1:23": "And only they had heard, That he then driving us out, now announces the good news, the faith which he then felt the absence of.",
    "Galatians 1:24": "And they glorified God in me.",
    "Galatians 2:1": "Then after fourteen years, again went I up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, having taken together Titus.",
    "Galatians 2:2": "And I went up according to revelation, and placed before them the good news which I proclaim in the nations, but apart to them highly esteemed, lest I run in vain, or ran.",
    "Galatians 2:3": "But neither Titus, with me, being a Greek, was forced to be circumcised:",
    "Galatians 2:4": "And through false brethren introduced privately, who came in privately to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might reduce us to slavery:",
    "Galatians 2:5": "To whom we yielded in subjection, not for an hour; that the truth of the good news might remain with you.",
    "Galatians 2:6": "And from them seeming to be something, (whatever they were, it concerns me nothing: God receives not man’s face:) for they seeming entrusted nothing to me:",
    "Galatians 2:7": "But on the contrary, having seen that I have been entrusted with the good news of uncircumcision, as Peter of circumcision;",
    "Galatians 2:8": "(For be having been energetic in Peter for the mission of circumcision, was energetic also in me for the nations:)",
    "Galatians 2:9": "And having known the grace given to me, James, and Cephas, and John, seeming to be pillars, gave me and Barnabas the right hands of communion; that we for the nations, and they for the circumcision.",
    "Galatians 2:10": "Only that we remember the poor; and this same was I forward to do.",
    "Galatians 2:11": "And when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to the face, for he was to be rebuked.",
    "Galatians 2:12": "For before certain came from James, he ate with the nations: and when they came, he drew down, and separated himself, being afraid of them of the circumcision.",
    "Galatians 2:13": "And the rest of the Jews also dissembled with him; so that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.",
    "Galatians 2:14": "But when I saw that they went not upon the strait road according to the truth of the good news, I said to Peter before all, If thou, being a Jew, livest according to the nations, and not according to the Jews, why forcest thou the nations to live as the Jews?",
    "Galatians 2:15": "We by nature Jews, and not sinners from the nations,",
    "Galatians 2:16": "Knowing that a man is not justified from the works of the law, but through faith of Jesus Christ, and we believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified from the faith of Christ, and not from the works of the law: therefore from the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.",
    "Galatians 2:17": "And it; seeking to be justified in Christ, we were found also ourselves sinners, is Christ therefore the servant of sin? It may not be.",
    "Galatians 2:18": "For if what I destroy, these I build again, I unite myself with the transgressor.",
    "Galatians 2:19": "For I through the law died to the law, that. I might live to God.",
    "Galatians 2:20": "I am crucified with Christ: and I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in we: and what I now live in the flesh I live in the faith of the Son of God, having loved me, and given himself for me.",
    "Galatians 2:21": "I put not away the grace of God for if justice through the law, Christ died in vain.",
    "Galatians 3:1": "O Unwise Galatians, who has cast a spell upon you, not to obey the truth, to whom before the eyes Jesus Christ was written beforehand, crucified in you?",
    "Galatians 3:2": "This only wish I to learn from you, Received ye the Spirit from the works of the law, or from the hearing of faith?",
    "Galatians 3:3": "Are ye so unwise? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now completed in the flesh?",
    "Galatians 3:4": "Suffered ye so many things in vain? if yet also in vain.",
    "Galatians 3:5": "He therefore furnishing you the Spirit, and working the powers in you, is it from the works of the law, or from the hearing of faith?",
    "Galatians 3:6": "As Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for justice.",
    "Galatians 3:7": "Know ye therefore that they of faith, these are sons of Abraham.",
    "Galatians 3:8": "And the writing, foreseeing that of faith God justifies the nations, announced beforehand the good news to Abraham, That in thee shall all nations be praised.",
    "Galatians 3:9": "So that they of faith are praised with faithful Abraham.",
    "Galatians 3:10": "For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it has been written, Cursed every one who remains not in all written in the book of the law to do them.",
    "Galatians 3:11": "And that none is justified in the law before God, is manifest: for, The just shall live of faith.",

    "Galatians 3:14": "That the praise of Abraham might be to the nations in Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.",
    "Galatians 3:15": "Brethren, I speak according to man; Although a man’s covenant, having been confirmed, none annuls, or orders an addition.",
    "Galatians 3:16": "And to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He says not, And to seeds, as to many; but as to one: And to thy seed, who is Christ.",
    "Galatians 3:17": "And I say this, the covenant confirmed before by God in Christ, the law, having been after four hundred and thirty years, does not annul, to neglect the promise.",
    "Galatians 3:18": "For if of the law the inheritance, no more of promise: and God has favored Abraham by promise.",
    "Galatians 3:19": "What then the law? It was added on account of transgressions, (till the seed come to whom it was promised;) appointed by angels in the hand of a mediator.",
    "Galatians 3:20": "And a mediator is not of one, and God is one.",
    "Galatians 3:21": "The law then against the promises of God? It may not be: for if a law had been given able to make alive, truly justice would be by the law.",
    "Galatians 3:22": "But the writing shut up all things under sin, that the promise from faith of Jesus Christ might be given to the believing.",
    "Galatians 3:23": "And before faith came, we were guarded under the law, shut up to faith about to be revealed.",
    "Galatians 3:24": "So that the law was our preceptor towards Christ, that we might be justified from faith.",
    "Galatians 3:25": "And faith having come, we are no more under a preceptor.",
    "Galatians 3:26": "For we are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.",
    "Galatians 3:27": "For as many of you as were immersed into Christ have put on Christ.",
    "Galatians 3:28": "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither servant nor free, there is neither male and female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.",
    "Galatians 3:29": "And if ye of Christ, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.",
    "Galatians 4:1": "And I say, for as long time as the heir is a child, he differs nothing from a servant, being lord of all;",
    "Galatians 4:2": "But is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father.",
    "Galatians 4:3": "So also we, when we were children, were subjugated under the world’s elements:",
    "Galatians 4:4": "And when the completion of the time was come, God sent his Son, born of woman, born under the law,",
    "Galatians 4:5": "That he might redeem them under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.",
    "Galatians 4:6": "And because ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.",
    "Galatians 4:7": "So that thou art no more a servant, but a son: and if a son, also an heir of God through Christ.",

    "Galatians 4:11": "I am afraid of you, lest I have been wearied for you in vain.",
    "Galatians 4:12": "Be ye as I, for I also as you, brethren, I pray you: ye injured me nothing.",
    "Galatians 4:13": "And ye know that through weakness of the flesh I announced the good news to you before.",
    "Galatians 4:14": "And my temptation in my flesh, ye counted not as nothing, nor spurned; but as an angel of God ye received me, as Christ Jesus.",
    "Galatians 4:15": "What then was your happiness? for I testify to you, that, if possible, having plucked out your eyes, ye would have given to me.",
    "Galatians 4:16": "Have I then been your enemy, speaking truth to you.",
    "Galatians 4:17": "They are zealous for you, not well; but they wish to exclude you, that ye might be zealous for them.",
    "Galatians 4:18": "And good to be zealous always in good, and not only in my being present with you.",
    "Galatians 4:19": "My children, for whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you,",
    "Galatians 4:20": "And I would be present with you now, and change my voice; for I am perplexed about you.",
    "Galatians 4:21": "Tell me, those wishing to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?",
    "Galatians 4:22": "For it has been written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the bondmaid, and one by the free.",
    "Galatians 4:23": "But he truly of the bondmaid was born according to the flesh; and he of the free through the promise.",
    "Galatians 4:24": "Which things are spoken figuratively: for these are the two covenants; one truly from mount Sinai, begetting to bondage, which is Agar.",
    "Galatians 4:25": "For Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and now stands in the same rank With Jerusalem, and is in a servile condition with her children.",
    "Galatians 4:26": "But Jerusalem above is free, which is mother of us all.",
    "Galatians 4:27": "For it has been written, Be cheered, O barren, bearing not; break out and cry, she travailing not: for many more the children of the desolate than she having a husband.",
    "Galatians 4:28": "And we, brethren, as Isaac, are children of promise.",
    "Galatians 4:29": "But as then he born according to the flesh drove out him according to the Spirit, so also now.",
    "Galatians 4:30": "But what says the writing? Cast out the bondmaid and her son; for the son of the bondmaid shall not inherit with the son of the free.",
    "Galatians 4:31": "Therefore, brethren, we are not children of the bondmaid, but of the free.",
    "Galatians 5:1": "Therefore in the liberty which Christ has freed us, stand ye, and be not again held in the yoke of servitude.",
    "Galatians 5:2": "Behold, I Paul say to you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.",
    "Galatians 5:3": "And again to any man circumcised, I testify, that he is debtor to do the whole law.",
    "Galatians 5:4": "Ye were neglected from Christ, whoever are justified in the law; ye have fallen from grace.",
    "Galatians 5:5": "For we in spirit by faith expect the hope of justice.",
    "Galatians 5:6": "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any power, nor uncircumcision; but faith being energetic through love.",
    "Galatians 5:7": "Ye were running well; who hindered you not to obey the truth?",

    "Galatians 5:10": "I have trusted to you in the Lord, that ye will have nothing different in mind; and he troubling you shall bear judgment, whoever he be.",
    "Galatians 5:11": "And I, brethren, if I yet proclaim circumcision, why am I. yet driven out? therefore the offence of the cross is left unemployed.",
    "Galatians 5:12": "I would also they shall be cut off who having risen up against you.",
    "Galatians 5:13": "For ye were called to liberty brethren; only not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but through love serve ye one another.",
    "Galatians 5:14": "For all the law is completed in one word, in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.",
    "Galatians 5:15": "And if ye bite and devour one another, see ye that ye be not laid waste by one another.",
    "Galatians 5:16": "And I say, Walk in Spirit, and complete not the desire of the flesh.",
    "Galatians 5:17": "For the flesh desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are adverse to one another: that not the things ye would, these should ye do.",
    "Galatians 5:18": "And if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.",
    "Galatians 5:19": "And the works of the flesh are manifest, which are; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, licentiousness,",
    "Galatians 5:20": "Idolatry, charm, enmities, strifes, jealousies, wraths, intriguings, seditions, sects.",
    "Galatians 5:21": "Envyings, slaughters, drunkenness, revelries, and the like: to these which I foretell you, as I have also said before, that they doing such shall not inherit the kingdom of God.",
    "Galatians 5:22": "And the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faith,",
    "Galatians 5:23": "Meekness, temperance: against such is no law.",

    "Galatians 6:1": "Brethren, if a man be taken in any fault, ye the spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; observing thyself narrowly, lest thou also be tempted.",
    "Galatians 6:2": "Bear one another’s burdens, and so fill up the law of Christ:",
    "Galatians 6:3": "For if any think to be something, being nothing, he deceives himself.",
    "Galatians 6:4": "And let each try his own work, and then in himself alone will he have boasting, and not in another.",
    "Galatians 6:5": "For each shall bear his own load.",

    "Galatians 6:8": "For he sowing to his flesh of the flesh shall reap corruption; but he sowing to the Spirit, of the Spirit shall reap eternal life.",
    "Galatians 6:9": "And doing good let us not despond: for in proper time we shall reap, not being enervated.",
    "Galatians 6:10": "Wherefore then as we have time, let us work good to all, and chiefly to them of the household of faith.",
    "Galatians 6:11": "See ye how large letters I wrote to you with mine own hand.",
    "Galatians 6:12": "As many as: wish to have an agreeable demeanor in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only lest they should be driven out for the cross of Christ.",
    "Galatians 6:13": "For neither they being circumcised themselves observe the law; but they wish you to be circumcised, that they might boast in your flesh.",
    "Galatians 6:14": "And it may not be to me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.",
    "Galatians 6:15": "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any power, nor uncircumcision but a new creation.",

    "Philemon 1:20": "Yea, brother, may I be profited by thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.",
    "Philemon 1:21": "Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote to thee, knowing that thou wilt do above what I say to thee.",

    "Philemon 1:25": "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with your spirit. Amen.",
    "Hebrews 1:1": "God, formerly multifariously and abundantly having spoken to the fathers in the prophets,",
    "Hebrews 1:2": "At these last days spake to us in the Son, whom he set heir of all things, by whom also he made the times;",
    "Hebrews 1:3": "Who being the brightness of glory, and the figure of his foundation, and bearing all things by the word of his power, having made by himself the purification of our sins, he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty among the highest ones;",
    "Hebrews 1:4": "Being so much better than the angels, inasmuch as he has inherited a more distinguished name than they.",
    "Hebrews 1:5": "For to which of the angels once said he, Thou art my Son, I have this day begotten thee? And again, I will be to him for Father, and he shall be to me for Son?",
    "Hebrews 1:6": "And when again he should bring in the firstborn to the habitable globe, he says, And let all the angels of God worship him.",
    "Hebrews 1:7": "And truly to the angels of God he says, Who making his angels spirits, and his workmen flames of fire.",
    "Hebrews 1:8": "And to the Son, Thy throne, O God, for the time of time: a rod of uprightness the rod of thy kingdom.",

    "Hebrews 1:10": "And, Thou, at the beginning, Lord, didst lay the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the work of thy hands:",
    "Hebrews 1:11": "These shall be destroyed; but thou remainest; and they all as a garment shall grow old;",
    "Hebrews 1:12": "And as a cloak shalt thou turn them round, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.",
    "Hebrews 1:13": "And to which of the angels has he once said, Sit on my right hand, till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet?",
    "Hebrews 1:14": "Are they not all spirits qualified for service, sent forth for service for them about to inherit salvation?",
    "Hebrews 2:1": "For this ought we to hold above measure to the things heard, lest we slip away.",
    "Hebrews 2:2": "For if the word spoken by angels was firm, and every transgression and bad instruction received the just payment of reward;",
    "Hebrews 2:3": "How shall we escape, having neglected such great salvation; which at the beginning taken to be spoken by the Lord, by them having heard was made firm to us;",
    "Hebrews 2:4": "God confirming the testimony, together with signs and wonders, and various powers, and partitions of the Holy Spirit, according to his will.",
    "Hebrews 2:5": "For not to the angels has he subjected the habitable globe about to be, of which we speak.",
    "Hebrews 2:6": "And somewhere a certain one testified, saying, What is man, that thou rememberest him? or the son of man, that thou reviewest him?",
    "Hebrews 2:7": "Thou didst render him some little while less than angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst place him over the work of thine hands:",
    "Hebrews 2:8": "All things didst thou place under his feet. For in placing all things under him, thou didst leave nothing not subjected to him. And now we see not yet all things placed under him.",
    "Hebrews 2:9": "But we see Jesus, made some little while less than angels by the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; so that by the grace of God he should taste of death for all.",

    "Hebrews 2:13": "And again, I will be confident in him. And again, Behold I and the young children which God gave me.",
    "Hebrews 2:14": "Since therefore the young children participated in flesh and blood, he also likewise participated with them; that by death he might leave unemployed him having the strength of death, that is, the devil;",
    "Hebrews 2:15": "And deliver them, as many as by fear of death were always to live bound by slavery.",
    "Hebrews 2:16": "For certainly he lays not hold of angels; but of the seed of Abraham he lays hold.",
    "Hebrews 2:17": "Wherefore in all things it was necessary to be made like to the brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful chief priest in things towards God, in order to propitiate for the sin of the people.",
    "Hebrews 2:18": "For in that he himself has suffered, having been tempted, he is able to help the tempted.",
    "Hebrews 3:1": "Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, observe the sent and Chief Priest of our assent, Christ Jesus;",
    "Hebrews 3:2": "Faithful to him having made him, as also Moses in his whole house.",

    "Hebrews 3:7": "Wherefore (as the Holy Spirit says, If to day ye hear his voice,",
    "Hebrews 3:8": "Harden not your hearts, as in the exasperation, in the day of trial in the desert:",
    "Hebrews 3:9": "Where your fathers tried me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.",
    "Hebrews 3:10": "Wherefore I was offended with that generation and I said, They always wander in heart; and they knew not my ways.",
    "Hebrews 3:11": "As I aware in my wrath, If they shall come into my rest.)",
    "Hebrews 3:12": "See, brethren, lest there shall be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in removing away from the living God.",
    "Hebrews 3:13": "But beseech one another according to each day, as far as the day is called; lest any of you be hardened by deceit of sin.",
    "Hebrews 3:14": "For we have been partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our foundation firm to the end;",
    "Hebrews 3:15": "In that it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, ye should not harden your hearts, as in the exasperation.",
    "Hebrews 3:16": "For some, having heard, did exasperate: but not all they having come out of Egypt by Moses.",
    "Hebrews 3:17": "And with whom was he offended forty years? was it not with them having sinned, whose members fell in the desert?",

    "Hebrews 3:19": "And we see they could not come in through unbelief.",
    "Hebrews 4:1": "Let us therefore fear, lest a solemn promise being left to come into his rest, any of you should seem to have failed.",
    "Hebrews 4:2": "For we also were announced of the good news, as well as they: but the word of the report profited them not, not being mixed with faith to them having heard.",
    "Hebrews 4:3": "For we having believed come into the rest, as he said, As I sware in my wrath, if they shall come into my rest: although the works having been from the foundation of the world.",
    "Hebrews 4:4": "For he said somewhere of the seventh thus, And God ceased in the seventh day from all his works.",
    "Hebrews 4:5": "And in this again, If they shall enter into my rest.",
    "Hebrews 4:6": "Since therefore it remains for some to come into it, and they before announced of the good news came not in through unbelief:",
    "Hebrews 4:7": "Again he limits a certain day, saying in David, To day, after such time; as it is said, To day if ye would hear his voice, harden not your hearts.",
    "Hebrews 4:8": "For if Jesus had caused them to rest, he would not have spoken of another day after these things.",
    "Hebrews 4:9": "Therefore a celebration of a sabbath remains to the people of God.",
    "Hebrews 4:10": "For he having come into his rest, he also has ceased from his works, as God from his own.",
    "Hebrews 4:11": "Therefore we should be earnest to come into that rest, lest any should fall in the same pattern of unbelief.",
    "Hebrews 4:12": "For the word of God living, and effective, and more piercing than any two-mouthed sword, and penetrating even to the division both of soul and spirit, both the joints and marrows, and a critic of the reflections and thoughts of the heart.",
    "Hebrews 4:13": "And there is no creation invisible before him: and all things naked and exposed, neck and face to view, to the eyes of him with whom to us is the word.",
    "Hebrews 4:14": "Having therefore a great chief priest, passed to the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, we should hold firmly the assent.",
    "Hebrews 4:15": "For we have not a chief priest unable to suffer with our weaknesses; but tried in all things as a resemblance, without sin.",
    "Hebrews 4:16": "We should therefore go with freedom of speech to the throne of grace, that we receive mercy, and find grace for timely assistance.",
    "Hebrews 5:1": "For every chief priest taken from men is appointed for men for things to God, that he bring both gifts and sacrifices for sins:",
    "Hebrews 5:2": "Being able to moderate the passions to the ignorant, and deceived; since he also is surrounded with weakness.",
    "Hebrews 5:3": "And for this he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to bring in for sins.",
    "Hebrews 5:4": "And not any takes this honour to himself; but the called of God, as also Aaron.",
    "Hebrews 5:5": "So also Christ honoured not himself, to become chief priest; but he having spoken to him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.",
    "Hebrews 5:6": "And also in another he says, Thou a priest forever according to the order of Melchisedec.",
    "Hebrews 5:7": "Who in the days of his flesh, both prayers and supplications to him able to save him from death, with strong crying and tears, having offered, and listened to by means of circumspection;",
    "Hebrews 5:8": "Although being a Son, he learned obedience from what he suffered;",
    "Hebrews 5:9": "And being perfected, he became to all them lending a willing ear to him the origin of eternal salvation.",
    "Hebrews 5:10": "Addressed by God the chief priest according to the order of Melchisedec.",
    "Hebrews 5:11": "Of whom great is the word to us, and difficult of interpretation to speak, since ye have been sluggish in the hearing.",
    "Hebrews 5:12": "For also ye ought to be teachers for the time, again ye have need for some one to teach you the elements of the beginning of the sayings of God; and have become those having need of milk, and not of firm food.",
    "Hebrews 5:13": "For every one partaking of milk is inexperienced in the word of justice: for he is a child.",
    "Hebrews 5:14": "And firm food is of the perfected, of them by habit having the senses exercised for the separation of good and evil.",
    "Hebrews 6:1": "Therefore having left the word of the beginning of Christ, we should go on to perfection; not again laying down the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,",
    "Hebrews 6:2": "Of the teaching of immersions, and placing upon of hands, and of the rising up of the dead, and of eternal judgment.",
    "Hebrews 6:3": "And this will we do, if God even permit.",
    "Hebrews 6:4": "For impossible for them once enlightened, and having tasted of the heavenly gift, and having partaken of the Holy Spirit,",
    "Hebrews 6:5": "And tasted of the good word of God, and powers of the life about to be,",
    "Hebrews 6:6": "And having fallen, again to renew to repentance; crucifying to themselves the Son of God, and exposing to ignominy.",
    "Hebrews 6:7": "For the earth drinking the rain coming often upon it, and bringing forth the vegetable fitting well to them by whom it is cultivated, receives commendation from God:",
    "Hebrews 6:8": "And producing thorns and briers is rejected, after having been tried, and near cursing; whose end for destruction.",
    "Hebrews 6:9": "And we have been persuaded of you, dearly beloved, of better things, and connected with salvation, if we also thus speak.",
    "Hebrews 6:10": "For God is not unjust to forget your work and fatigue of love, which ye showed to his name, having served to the holy ones, and serving.",
    "Hebrews 6:11": "And we desire each of you to show the same earnestness to the complete certainty of hope to the end:",
    "Hebrews 6:12": "That ye be not sluggish, but imitators of them inheriting the promises by faith and longsuffering.",
    "Hebrews 6:13": "For God promising to Abraham, since he had none greater to swear by, sware by himself,",
    "Hebrews 6:14": "Saying, Truly will I praise thee, and multiplying will I multiply thee.",
    "Hebrews 6:15": "And so, having endured long, he gained the promise.",
    "Hebrews 6:16": "For truly men swear by the greater: and the oath for confirmation to them the end of all controversy.",
    "Hebrews 6:17": "In which God, willing more abundantly to show to the heirs of the promise the firmness of his counsel, he intervened by an oath:",
    "Hebrews 6:18": "That by two unalterable deeds, in which it is impossible for God to deceive we might have a strong consolation, taking refuge in holding firmly the hope set before:",
    "Hebrews 6:19": "Which we have as an anchor of the soul, unshaken and firm, and entering into that further within the veil.",
    "Hebrews 6:20": "Where the forerunner, Jesus, went in for us, according to the order of Melchisedec, being a high priest forever.",
    "Hebrews 7:1": "For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, having met Abraham returning from the cutting off of the kings, and praised him;",
    "Hebrews 7:2": "To whom also Abraham divided a tenth from all; (first truly interpreted King of justice, and then also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;",
    "Hebrews 7:3": "Without father, without mother, of unknown origin, neither having beginning of days, nor end of life; and likened to the Son of God;) remains a priest perpetually.",
    "Hebrews 7:4": "And behold how great this one, to whom also Abraham the patriarch gave the tenth of the first fruits.",
    "Hebrews 7:5": "And they truly of the sons of Levi, receiving the office of priest, have a command to take a tenth part from the people according to the law, that is, from their brethren, although having come out of the loins of Abraham:",
    "Hebrews 7:6": "And he not having his descent traced from them received a tenth from Abraham, and praised him having the promises.",
    "Hebrews 7:7": "And without all controversy the less is praised of the better.",
    "Hebrews 7:8": "And here truly dying men receive tenths; but there he, bearing witness that he lives.",
    "Hebrews 7:9": "And as the word says, through Abraham, also Levi, receiving tenths, has paid a tenth.",
    "Hebrews 7:10": "For yet was he in his father’s loins, when Melchisedec met him.",
    "Hebrews 7:11": "If truly therefore completion were by the Levitical priesthood, (for the people received legislation by it,) what further need according to the order of Melchisedec for another priest to be raised, and not according to the order of Aaron?",
    "Hebrews 7:12": "For the priesthood being transferred, of necessity also is a transposition of law.",
    "Hebrews 7:13": "For he of whom these things are said partook of another tribe, of which none held to the altar.",
    "Hebrews 7:14": "For it is manifest that our Lord has sprung out of Judah; to which tribe Moses spake nothing of the priesthood.",
    "Hebrews 7:15": "And it is yet more abundantly manifest: that according to the resemblance of Melchisedec has another priest risen,",
    "Hebrews 7:16": "Who according to the law of a fleshly command was not born, but according to the power of an indestructible life.",
    "Hebrews 7:17": "For he testifies, Thou a priest forever, according to the order of Melchisedec.",
    "Hebrews 7:18": "For there is truly an annulling of the command going before by its weakness and unprofitableness.",
    "Hebrews 7:19": "(For the law completed nothing,) but the bringing in of a better hope; by which we draw near to God.",
    "Hebrews 7:20": "And as much as not without sacrifice sanctioned by solemn oath:",
    "Hebrews 7:21": "(For they truly without sacrifice sanctioned by solemn oath became priests; but he with the sacrifice sanctioned by solemn oath by him, saying to him, The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou priest forever, according to the order of Melchisedec:)",
    "Hebrews 7:22": "According to this, Jesus has become security of a better covenant.",
    "Hebrews 7:23": "And they truly are become many priests, by reason of death being hindered from remaining:",
    "Hebrews 7:24": "And he, because he remains forever, has an inviolable priesthood.",
    "Hebrews 7:25": "Wherefore he is able to save entirely those coming to God by him, always living to supplicate for them.",
    "Hebrews 7:26": "For such a chief priest became us, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and being higher than the heavens;",
    "Hebrews 7:27": "Who has no necessity according to the day, as the chief priests, before to bring up sacrifices for their own sins, then for those of the people; for this he did once, having brought up himself.",
    "Hebrews 7:28": "For the law establishes men chief priests having weakness; but the word of the sacrifice sanctioned by solemn oath, after the law, the Son, having been perfected forever.",
    "Hebrews 8:1": "And the summary to the things spoken: We have such a chief priest, who sat on the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;",
    "Hebrews 8:2": "A workman of holy things, and of the true tent, which the Lord pitched, and not man.",
    "Hebrews 8:3": "For every chief priest is appointed to bring in gifts and sacrifices also: wherefore it is necessary also for this to have something which he might bring.",
    "Hebrews 8:4": "For if truly he were upon earth, he would not be a priest, there being priests bringing in gifts according to the law;",
    "Hebrews 8:5": "Who serve the pattern and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was given an intimation of the divine will, being about to complete the tent: for, See, says he, thou make all things according to the type shewed thee in the mount.",
    "Hebrews 8:6": "And now he has attained a more distinguished office, in how much also he is mediator of a better covenant, which was legislated upon better promises.",
    "Hebrews 8:7": "For if that first was faultless, then place was not to be sought for the second.",
    "Hebrews 8:8": "For rebuking them, he says, Behold, the days come, says the Lord, and I will complete for the house of Israel and for the house of Judah a new covenant:",
    "Hebrews 8:9": "Not according to the covenant which I made to their fathers in the day of my taking their hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; for they remained not in my covenant, and I heeded them not, says the Lord.",
    "Hebrews 8:10": "For this the covenant which I will set to the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord; giving my laws into their mind, and upon their hearts will I write them: and I will be to them for God, and they shall be to me for a people:",
    "Hebrews 8:11": "And they should not teach each his neighbor, and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from their little even to their great ones.",
    "Hebrews 8:12": "For I will be merciful to their iniquities, and their sins and their injustices will I remember no more.",
    "Hebrews 8:13": "In saying new, he has made the first old. And that made old and becoming weak is near destruction.",
    "Hebrews 9:1": "And truly therefore the first had precepts of divine service for him, and a worldly holy place.",
    "Hebrews 9:2": "For the first tent was prepared; (in which was the chandelier, and table, and the setting up of the loaves;) which is called holy.",
    "Hebrews 9:3": "And after the second veil, the tent called Holy of Holies;",
    "Hebrews 9:4": "Having the golden censer, and ark of the covenant surrounded on all sides with gold, in which was the golden urn having the manna, and Aaron’s rod having budded, and the tables of the covenant;",
    "Hebrews 9:5": "And above it the cherubs of glory overshadowing the propitiatory; of which it is not now to speak in turn.",
    "Hebrews 9:6": "And these thus prepared, truly to the first tent the priests always came in, to complete the divine services.",
    "Hebrews 9:7": "And into the second the chief priest alone once a year, not without blood, which he brings near for himself, and the errors of the people:",
    "Hebrews 9:8": "This the Holy Spirit designating, the way of the holies had not yet been made manifest, the first tent yet having a standing:",
    "Hebrews 9:9": "Which a parable for the time placed in, according to which both gifts and sacrifices are brought near, not being able for consciousness to perfect him serving;",
    "Hebrews 9:10": "Only in food and drinks, and different immersions, and precepts of the flesh, being placed till the time of amendment.",
    "Hebrews 9:11": "And Christ being present, a chief priest of good things about to be, by a greater and more perfect tent, not made with hands, that is; not of this creation;",
    "Hebrews 9:12": "Neither by the blood of he-goats and calves, and by his own blood he went in once for all to the holies, having found eternal deliverance.",
    "Hebrews 9:13": "For if the blood of bulls and he-goats, and the ashes of a heifer besprinkling the polluted, consecrates to the purity of the flesh:",
    "Hebrews 9:14": "How much more shall the blood of Christ, who by the eternal Spirit offered himself blameless to God, purify your consciousness from dead works to serve the living God?",
    "Hebrews 9:15": "And for this he is mediator of a new covenant, that death having been, for redemption of the transgressions for the first covenant, the called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.",
    "Hebrews 9:16": "For where a will, the necessity for the death of him having willed to be brought forward.",
    "Hebrews 9:17": "For a will is firm by the dead: since it has no power when he having willed lives.",
    "Hebrews 9:18": "Wherefore neither was the first consecrated without blood.",
    "Hebrews 9:19": "For every command spoken according to law by Moses, to all the people, having taken the blood of calves and he-goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and also the book, and he sprinkled all the people,",
    "Hebrews 9:20": "Saying, This the blood of the covenant which God enjoined to you.",
    "Hebrews 9:21": "And also the tent, and all the vessels of the service, he poured all over likewise with blood.",
    "Hebrews 9:22": "And almost all things are purified according to the law with blood; and without blood-letting there is no remission.",
    "Hebrews 9:23": "Therefore truly a necessity for the patterns of things in the heavens to be purified with these; and the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.",
    "Hebrews 9:24": "For Christ came not into the holy places made with hands, the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to be shown clearly to the face of God for us:",
    "Hebrews 9:25": "Neither that he should offer himself many times, as the chief priest comes in to the holy places yearly with blood pertaining to others;",
    "Hebrews 9:26": "(Since he must have suffered many times from the foundation of the world:) but now once at the termination of the times for the annulling of sin by the sacrifice of himself has he been shown clearly.",
    "Hebrews 9:27": "And inasmuch as it is reserved to men once to die, and after this the judgment:",
    "Hebrews 9:28": "So Christ, once offered to have borne the sins of many, of the second time, without sin, shall be seen to them expecting him for salvation.",
    "Hebrews 10:1": "For the law having a shadow of good things about to be, not the same image of the things, with these sacrifices which they bring in yearly in continuance never can render perfect them coming thereto.",
    "Hebrews 10:2": "For would they not have ceased to be brought in? because they serving have no more consciousness of sins, once purified.",
    "Hebrews 10:3": "But in these, a reminding of sins yearly.",
    "Hebrews 10:4": "For the blood of bulls and he-goats cannot take away sins.",
    "Hebrews 10:5": "Wherefore coming into the world, he says, Sacrifice and offering then wouldest not, but a body hast thou adjusted to me:",
    "Hebrews 10:6": "And with whole burnt offering for sin wast thou not contented.",
    "Hebrews 10:7": "Then said I, Behold, I am here (in the head of the book it was written of me,) O God, to do thy will.",
    "Hebrews 10:8": "Farther back, saying, That sacrifice and bringing in and whole burnt offerings and for sin thou wouldest not, neither wert contented with; which are brought in according to law;",
    "Hebrews 10:9": "Then he said, Behold, I am here to do, O God, thy will. He takes away the first, that he might set up the second.",
    "Hebrews 10:10": "In which will we are consecrated by the bringing in of the body of Jesus Christ once.",
    "Hebrews 10:11": "And truly every priest has stood daily, serving and bringing in many times the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:",
    "Hebrews 10:12": "But this, having brought in one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God;",
    "Hebrews 10:13": "As to the rest, awaiting till his enemies be put a footstool of his feet.",
    "Hebrews 10:14": "For by one offering has he perfected forever the consecrated.",
    "Hebrews 10:15": "And also the Holy Spirit testifies to us: for after having said before,",
    "Hebrews 10:16": "This the covenant which I will establish with them after those days, says the Lord, giving my laws upon their heart, and upon their minds will I write them;",
    "Hebrews 10:17": "And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.",
    "Hebrews 10:18": "And where remission of these, no more bringing in for sin.",
    "Hebrews 10:19": "Having therefore, brethren, freedom of speech for the entering in of the holies by the blood of Jesus,",
    "Hebrews 10:20": "A way publicly declared and living, which he consecrated to us, through the veil, that is, his flesh;",
    "Hebrews 10:21": "And a great priest over the house of God;",
    "Hebrews 10:22": "Let us approach with a true heart in complete certainty of faith, having our hearts be sprinkled from an evil consciousness, and having our bodies washed with pure water.",
    "Hebrews 10:23": "We should hold the assent of hope not bending; (for faithful he having promised;)",
    "Hebrews 10:24": "And we should observe one another for the incitement of love and good works:",
    "Hebrews 10:25": "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom to some; but beseeching: and by so much the more, inasmuch as ye see the day drawing near.",
    "Hebrews 10:26": "For we sinning voluntarily after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there is left no more a sacrifice for sins,",
    "Hebrews 10:27": "But a certain terrible expectation of judgment and jealousy of fire, being about to devour the adversaries.",

    "James 1:22": "And be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.",
    "James 1:23": "For if any is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like a man observing the face of his creation in a mirror:",
    "James 1:24": "For he observed himself, and went away, and straightway forgot of what kind he was.",

    "James 2:1": "My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, of glory, with distinction of faces.",
    "James 2:2": "For if there come into your synagogue a man wearing gold rings on is fingers, in brilliant clothing, and there come in also a beggar in filthy clothing;",
    "James 2:3": "And ye look toward him bearing the brilliant clothing, and ye say to him, Sit thou well here; and to the beggar ye say, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:",
    "James 2:4": "Were ye not separated among yourselves, and become judges of evil reflections?",
    "James 2:5": "Hear, my dearly beloved brethren, Has not God chosen the beggars of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to them loving him?",
    "James 2:6": "And ye have despised the beggar. Do not the rich bring you into subjection, and draw you before tribunals?",
    "James 2:7": "And do they not defame the good name called upon you?",
    "James 2:8": "If yet ye complete the royal law according to the writing, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well:",
    "James 2:9": "And if ye make distinction of faces, ye work sin, being convicted under the law as transgressors.",
    "James 2:10": "For whoever shall keep the whole law, and stumble in one, has become bound of all.",
    "James 2:11": "For he having said, Thou shouldest not commit adultery, said also, Thou shouldest not kill: and if thou commit not adultery, and dost kill, thou hast become a transgressor of the law.",
    "James 2:12": "So speak ye, and so do, as about to be judged by the law of liberty.",
    "James 2:13": "For unpropitiated judgment to him not doing mercy; and mercy boasteth against judgment.",
    "James 2:14": "And what profit, my brethren, if any say he has faith, and should not have works? can faith save him?",
    "James 2:15": "And if a brother or sister be naked, and be failing of daily food,",
    "James 2:16": "And any of you say to them, Retire in peace, be ye warmed and be ye fed; and ye give them not things fitting the body; what profit?",
    "James 2:17": "So also faith, if it have not works, is dead by itself.",
    "James 2:18": "But certain will say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: show me thy faith without thy works, and I will show thee my faith from my works.",
    "James 2:19": "Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: and the evil spirits believe, and shudder.",
    "James 2:20": "And wilt thou know, O empty man, that faith without works is dead?",
    "James 2:21": "Was not Abraham our father justified by works, having brought up Isaac his son upon the altar.",
    "James 2:22": "Thou seest that faith cooperated with his works, and from works was faith perfected.",
    "James 2:23": "And the writing was completed, saying, And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for justice: and he was called the Friend of God.",
    "James 2:24": "Therefore ye see that man is justified from works, and not from faith alone.",
    "James 2:25": "And likewise also was not Rehab the harlot justified by works, having received the messengers, and cast out by another way?",
    "James 2:26": "For as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.",
    "James 3:1": "Be ye not many teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive the greater judgment.",
    "James 3:2": "For in many things we all stumble. If any stumble not in word, this a perfect man, able to govern by a bridle also the whole body.",
    "James 3:3": "Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they should yield to us; and we lead their whole body.",
    "James 3:4": "Behold also ships, being so great, and driven by hard winds, are led by the smallest rudder, wherever the desire of him steering should will.",
    "James 3:5": "So also the tongue is a small member, and vaunts itself. Behold, how great a wood a little fire inflames.",
    "James 3:6": "(And the tongue a fire, a world of iniquity: so the tongue is placed in our members, defiling the whole body, and burning the wheel of creation; and burned by hell.",
    "James 3:7": "For every nature of beasts, and also of birds, of creeping things, and also of things in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by the nature of man:",
    "James 3:8": "And the tongue none of men can tame; an ungovernable evil, full of deadly poison.",
    "James 3:9": "With it we praise the God and Father; and with it we curse men, those made according to the similitude of God.",
    "James 3:10": "Out of the same month comes forth blessing and cursing. There is no need, my brethren, for these things so to be.",
    "James 3:11": "Much less from the same aperture does a fountain bubble out sweet and bitter?",
    "James 3:12": "The fig tree, my brethren, cannot make olives, or the vine, figs: so no fountain can make salt and sweet water.",
    "James 3:13": "Who wise and knowing among you? let him show out of a good mode of life his works in meekness of wisdom.",
    "James 3:14": "And if ye have bitter envy and intrigue in your heart, boast not, and lie not against the truth.",
    "James 3:15": "This is wisdom coming not down from above, but earthly, natural, resembling an evil spirit.",
    "James 3:16": "For where envy and intrigue, there confusion and every bad deed.",
    "James 3:17": "And the wisdom from above is truly first pure, then peaceful, decorous, docile, full of mercy and good fruits, not separated, and unfeigned.",
    "James 3:18": "And the fruit of justice is sown in peace by those making peace.",
    "James 4:1": "Whence wars and fights among you? are they not hence, out of your sensual pleasures making war in your members.",
    "James 4:2": "Ye eagerly desire, and have not: ye kill, and are zealous, and cannot succeed: ye fight and wage war, and ye have not, because ye ask not.",
    "James 4:3": "Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask wickedly that ye might expend upon your sensual pleasures.",
    "James 4:4": "Adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is the enmity of God? whoever therefore would wish to be the friend of the world is set the enemy of God.",
    "James 4:5": "Or think ye that the writing says vainly, That the spirit longs for envy, which dwelt in us?",
    "James 4:6": "And he gives greater grace. Wherefore he says, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.",
    "James 4:7": "Be subjected therefore to God. Resist the accuser, and he will flee from you.",
    "James 4:8": "Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse the hands, ye sinful; and purify the hearts, ye double souled.",
    "James 4:9": "Toil, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and joy to dejection.",
    "James 4:10": "Be ye humbled before the Lord, and he will lift you up.",
    "James 4:11": "Speak not against one another, brethren. He speaking against a brother, and judging his brother, speaks against the law, and judges the law: and if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.",
    "James 4:12": "There is one legislator, able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another.",
    "James 4:13": "Come on now, ye saying, To day or to morrow let us go to this city, and do there one year, and let us trade, and derive profit:",
    "James 4:14": "(Which know not that of the morrow. For what your life? For it is a steam, appearing for a little, and then invisible.)",
    "James 4:15": "For you should say, If the Lord will, and we live, and should do this, or that.",
    "James 4:16": "And now ye boast in your arrogance: all such boasting is evil.",
    "James 4:17": "Therefore to him knowing to do good, and not doing, to him it is sin.",
    "James 5:1": "Come on now, ye rich, weep, uttering loud cries of grief for the misfortunes coming upon you.",
    "James 5:2": "Your riches have become corrupted, and your garments have been moth eaten;",
    "James 5:3": "Your gold and silver is become rusty; and their rust shall be for a witness to you, and shall eat your flesh as fire. Ye have gathered up treasures in the last days.",
    "James 5:4": "Behold, the hire of laborers having reaped your farms, withheld by you, cries out, and the cries of the reapers have entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.",
    "James 5:5": "Ye have led a luxurious life upon the earth, and have rioted in luxury; ye have nourished your hearts, as in the day of slaughter.",
    "James 5:6": "Ye have condemned, ye have killed the just one; and he resists you not.",
    "James 5:7": "Therefore be longsuffering, brethren, even to the arrival of the Lord. Behold, the farmer awaits the precious fruit of the earth, being longsuffering for it, even till he should receive the early and late rain.",
    "James 5:8": "Be longsuffering, ye also; make your hearts firm: for the arrival of the Lord has drawn near.",

    "James 5:10": "Take a pattern of affliction, my brethren, and of longsuffering, the prophets, who spake in the name of the Lord.",
    "James 5:11": "Behold, we esteem those enduring happy. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and ye see the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very compassionate and merciful.",
    "James 5:12": "And before all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, nor by earth, nor any other oath: and let your yea be yea; and nay, nay; that ye fall not under judgment.",
