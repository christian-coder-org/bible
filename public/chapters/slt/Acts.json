    "Mark 7:17": "And when he came into the house from the crowd, his disciples asked him of the parable.",
    "Mark 7:18": "And he says, So are ye also without understanding? Do ye not perceive, that anything from without entering into a man, cannot pollute him.",
    "Mark 7:19": "For it goes not into the heart, but into the belly, and goes forth into the privy, purging all food.",
    "Mark 7:20": "And he said, That going out of a man, that pollutes a man.",
    "Mark 7:21": "For within, out of the heart of men, go forth evil reflections, adulteries, fornications, murders,",
    "Mark 7:22": "Thefts, overreaching, deceit, licentiousness, an evil eye, defamation, pride, foolishness:",
    "Mark 7:23": "All these evils go out from within, and pollute a man.",
    "Mark 7:24": "And arising from thence, he departed into the bounds of Tyre and Sidon, and having come into the house, he would have none know; and he could not be hid.",
    "Mark 7:25": "For a woman having heard of him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, having come, fell at his feet:",
    "Mark 7:26": "And the woman was a Grecian, a Syrophenician by birth; and she entreated him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.",
    "Mark 7:27": "And Jesus said to her, Permit the children first to be satisfied; for it is not good to take the children’s bread, and cast to little dogs.",
    "Mark 7:28": "And she answered and says to him, Yes, Lord: for also the little dogs under the table eat from the children’s crumbs.",
    "Mark 7:29": "And he said to her, For this word retire; the demon has gone out of thy daughter.",
    "Mark 7:30": "And having departed to her house, she found the demon gone forth, and the daughter cast upon the bed.",
    "Mark 7:31": "And again, having gone out from the bounds of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, in the midst of the bounds of Decapolis.",
    "Mark 7:32": "And they bring to him a deaf one, tongue-tied; and they beseech him that he would put the hand upon him.",
    "Mark 7:33": "And having taken him away from the crowd apart, he put his fingers in his ears, and having spit, he touched his tongue;",
    "Mark 7:34": "And having looked up to heaven, he sighed, and says to him, Ephphatha, which is, Be opened.",
    "Mark 7:35": "And quickly his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake rightly.",
    "Mark 7:36": "And he charged them that they should say to none: and as much as he charged them, they proclaimed more abundantly;",
    "Mark 7:37": "And above measure were they struck with amazement, saying, Well has he done all things: he makes the deaf to hear, and the speechless to speak.",
    "Mark 8:1": "In those days the crowd being very many, and having nothing they might eat, Jesus having called his disciples, says to them,",
    "Mark 8:2": "I feel compassion for the crowd, for already they remain three days with me, and have nothing they might eat:",
    "Mark 8:3": "And if I loose them fasting to their house, they will be relaxed in the way: for some of them have come from far.",
    "Mark 8:4": "And his disciples answered him, Whence might anyone be able to satisfy these with loaves here in the lonely place?",
    "Mark 8:5": "And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.",
    "Mark 8:6": "And he enjoined to the crowd to recline upon the earth: and having taken the seven loaves, having returned thanks, he brake, and he gave to his disciples that they might set before; and they set before the crowd.",
    "Mark 8:7": "And they had a few little fishes: and having praised, he spake to set them also before.",
    "Mark 8:8": "And they ate, and were satisfied: and they took up the remains of the fragments, seven wicker baskets.",
    "Mark 8:9": "And they eating were about four thousand: and he loosed them.",
    "Mark 8:10": "And quickly having gone into the ship with his disciples, he came into the parts of Dalmanutha.",
    "Mark 8:11": "And the Pharisees came out, and began to search out with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.",
    "Mark 8:12": "And having sighed deeply in spirit, he says, Why seeks this generation for a sign Verily I say to you, shall a sign be given to this generation.",
    "Mark 8:13": "And having let them go, having gone again into the ship, he departed beyond.",
    "Mark 8:14": "And they forgot to take loaves, and had not but one loaf with them in the ship.",
    "Mark 8:15": "And he enjoined them, saying, See ye, look away from the leaven of the Pharisees, and the leaven of Herod.",
    "Mark 8:16": "And they reasoned with one another, saying, Because we have no loaves.",
    "Mark 8:17": "And Jesus having known, says to them, Why reason ye with yourselves, because ye have no loaves? observe ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?",
    "Mark 8:18": "Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and remember ye not?",
    "Mark 8:19": "When I brake the five loaves to five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say to him, Twelve.",
    "Mark 8:20": "And when the seven to four thousand, the fillings of how many baskets of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.",
    "Mark 8:21": "And he said to them, How do ye not understand.",
    "Mark 8:22": "And he comes to Bethsaida; and they bring to him one blind, and beseech him that he would touch him.",
    "Mark 8:23": "And having taken the hand of the blind, he led him forth without the town; and having spit into his eyes, having put hands upon him, he asked him if he saw any thing.",
    "Mark 8:24": "And having looked up, he said, I see men that I see as trees, walking.",
    "Mark 8:25": "Then again he put hands upon his eyes, and made him look up; and he was restored, and he saw all clearly.",
    "Mark 8:26": "And he sent him to his house, saying, Thou shouldest not either enter into the town, neither, say to any in the town.",
    "Mark 8:27": "And Jesus went out, and his disciples, to the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and he asked his disciples in the way, saying to them, Whom do men say me to be?",
    "Mark 8:28": "And they answered, John the Immerser: and some, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.",
    "Mark 8:29": "And he says to them, And whom do ye say me to be? And Peter, having answered, says to him, Thou art Christ.",
    "Mark 8:30": "And he rebuked them, that they should say to none concerning him.",
    "Mark 8:31": "And he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be disapproved of by the elders, and the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise up.",
    "Mark 8:32": "And he spake the word with frankness. And Peter having taken him, began to rebuke him.",
    "Mark 8:33": "And he having turned back, and having seen his disciples, rebuked Peter, saying, Retire behind me, Satan: for thou hast not in mind the things of God, but the things of men.",
    "Mark 8:34": "And having called the crowd with his disciples, he said to them, Whoever wills to come after me, let him absolutely deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.",
    "Mark 8:35": "For whoever wills to save his life shall lose it; and whoever should lose his life for my sake and the good news, the same shall save it.",
    "Mark 8:36": "For what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and injure his soul.",
    "Mark 8:37": "Or what shall a man give for the exchange of his soul?",
    "Mark 8:38": "For whoever should be ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; also the Son of man shall be ashamed of him, when he should come in the glory of the Father with the holy messengers.",
    "Mark 9:1": "And he said to them, Truly I say to you, That some of those are standing here, who should not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God having come in power.",
    "Mark 9:2": "And after six days Jesus takes Peter, and James, and John, and brings them up into a high mountain apart alone: and he was transformed before them.",
    "Mark 9:3": "And his garments were shining, exceeding white, such as no fuller on earth can make white.",
    "Mark 9:4": "And Elias was seen to them, with Moses: and they were speaking together with Jesus.",
    "Mark 9:5": "And Peter having answered, says to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tents; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.",
    "Mark 9:6": "For he knew not what he said; for they were terrified.",
    "Mark 9:7": "And a cloud was overshadowing them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my dearly beloved Son: hear ye him.",
    "Mark 9:8": "And suddenly, having looked around, they no more saw any one, but Jesus alone with them.",
    "Mark 9:9": "And they coming down from the mount, he charged them that they recount to none what they saw, except when the Son of man should arise from the dead.",
    "Mark 9:10": "And they held the word firmly to themselves, searching out together what it is to arise from the dead.",
    "Mark 9:11": "And having asked him, saying, That the scribes say that Elias must first come.",
    "Mark 9:12": "And he having answered, said to them, Elias truly having first come, restores all things; and how it has been written of the Son of man, that he suffer many things; and be set at nought.",
    "Mark 9:13": "But I say to you, that Elias also has come, and they did to him whatever they would, as it has been written of him.",
    "Mark 9:14": "And having come to the disciples, he saw a great crowd about them, and the scribes seeking out with them.",
    "Mark 9:15": "And immediately all the crowd; having seen him, were amazed, and running near greeted him.",
    "Mark 9:16": "And he asked the scribes, What seek ye together with them?",
    "Mark 9:17": "And one from the crowd having answered, said, Teacher, I have brought my son to thee, having a speechless spirit.",
    "Mark 9:18": "And wherever he overtakes him, he rends him: and he foams, and gnashes his teeth, and he is dried up: and I spake to thy disciples that they might cast him out; and they could not.",
    "Mark 9:19": "And he having answered, says to him, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you how long shall I bear with you? bring him to me.",
    "Mark 9:20": "And they brought him to him: and having seen him, quickly the spirit rent him; and having fallen upon the earth, foaming he rolled himself about.",
    "Mark 9:21": "And he asked his father, How long is it that this has been to him? And he said, From childhood.",
    "Mark 9:22": "And many times also it cast him into fire, and into water, that it might destroy him; but if thou canst anything, help us, having had compassion upon us.",
    "Mark 9:23": "And Jesus said to him, If thou canst believe, all things possible to him believing.",
    "Mark 9:24": "And quickly the child’s father having cried out with tears, said, I believe, O Lord, help thou mine unbelief.",
    "Mark 9:25": "And Jesus, having seen that the crowd ran together, rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, Speechless and deaf spirit, I command thee to come out of him, and that thou come no more into him.",
    "Mark 9:26": "And having cried and rent him much, it came forth, and he was as dead; so that many said, That he is dead.",
    "Mark 9:27": "And Jesus having held him by the hand, raised him; and he stood up.",
    "Mark 9:28": "And he having come into the house, his disciples asked him apart, Wherefore were we not able to cast him forth?",
    "Mark 9:29": "And he said to them, This kind can go, out by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.",
    "Mark 9:30": "And having come out thence they passed through Galilee; and he desired not that any one should know.",
    "Mark 9:31": "For he taught his disciples, and said to them, That the Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and having been killed, he shall raise himself the third day.",
    "Mark 9:32": "And they knew not the word, and were afraid to ask him.",
    "Mark 9:33": "And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What reasoned ye to yourselves in the way.",
    "Mark 9:34": "And they were silent; for they discussed to one another in the way, who the greatest.",
    "Mark 9:35": "And having sat down, he called the twelve, and says to them, If any wish to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.",
    "Mark 9:36": "And having taken a young child, he set him in the midst of them: and having taken it up in his arms, he said to them,",
    "Mark 9:37": "Whoever should receive ones of such young children in my name, receives me: and whoever should receive me, receives not me, but him sending me.",
    "Mark 9:38": "And John answered him, saying, Teacher, we saw a certain one casting out demons in thy name, who follows not us: and we checked him, for he follows not us.",
    "Mark 9:39": "And Jesus said, Check him not: for there is no one who shall do power in my name, and shall be able quickly to revile me.",
    "Mark 9:40": "For whoever is not against us, is for us.",
    "Mark 9:41": "For whoever should give you to drink a cup of water in my name, because ye are of Christ, verily I say to you, he should not lose his reward.",
    "Mark 9:42": "And whoever should scandalize one of these little ones believing in me, it is good for him rather if a millstone is put about his neck, and he be cast into the sea.",
    "Mark 9:43": "And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off; it is good for thee rather to enter into life maimed, than having two hands, to go away into hell, into inextinguishable fire:",
    "Mark 9:44": "Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.",
    "Mark 9:45": "And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life lame, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into inextinguishable fire:",
    "Mark 9:46": "Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.",
    "Mark 9:47": "And if thine eye offend thee, cast it out: it is good for thee, one-eyed, to come into the kingdom of God, than having two eyes to be cast into a hell of fire:",
    "Mark 9:48": "Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.",
    "Mark 9:49": "For all shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.",
    "Mark 9:50": "Salt good: but if the salt be saltless, with what will ye prepare it? Have salt in yourselves, and live in peace one with another.",
    "Mark 10:1": "And having risen from thence, he comes into the bounds of Judea, through the other side of Jordan: and crowds came together again to him; and, as he was accustomed, again he taught them.",

    "Mark 10:3": "And he, having answered, said to them, What did Moses command you?",
    "Mark 10:4": "And they said, Moses permitted to write a bill of divorce, and to loose.",
    "Mark 10:5": "And Jesus, having answered, said to them, For your hard heart he wrote you this command.",
    "Mark 10:6": "And from the beginning of creation God made them male and female.",
    "Mark 10:7": "For this will a man leave his father and mother, and be attached to his wife;",
    "Mark 10:8": "And they two shall be in one flesh: so that they are no more two, but one flesh.",
    "Mark 10:9": "What therefore God yoked together, let not man separate.",
    "Mark 10:10": "And again in the house, his disciples asked him of the same.",

    "Mark 10:15": "Truly I say to you, Whoever should not receive the kingdom of God as a young child, should not come into it.",
    "Mark 10:16": "And having taken them up in his arms, having put the hands upon them, he praised them.",
    "Mark 10:17": "And he going in the way, one running and having fallen upon his knees, asked him, Good teacher, What shall I do that I might inherit eternal life.",
    "Mark 10:18": "And Jesus said to him, Why sayest thou me good? none good, except the one God.",
    "Mark 10:19": "Thou knowest the commands: Thou shouldst not commit adultery; Thou shouldst not kill; Thou shouldst not steal; Thou shouldst not bear false testimony; Thou shouldst not defraud; Honour thy father and mother.",
    "Mark 10:20": "And he, having answered, said to him, O teacher, all these have I watched from my youth.",
    "Mark 10:21": "And Jesus having looked upon him, loved him, and said to him, One thing is wanting to thee retire; whatever thou hast, sell, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, having taken up the cross.",

    "John 4:46": "Then came Jesus again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain royal one, whose son was sick in Capernaum.",
    "John 4:47": "He, having heard that Jesus was come from Judea to Galilee, went away to him, and asked him that he would go down and heal his son: for he was about to die.",
    "John 4:48": "Then said Jesus to him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye would not believe.",
    "John 4:49": "The royal one says to Him, Lord, go down before my child dies.",
    "John 4:50": "Jesus says to him, Go; thy son lives. And the man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and he went.",
    "John 4:51": "And he already going down, his servants met him, and announced, saying, That thy child lives.",
    "John 4:52": "Then he inquired of them the hour in which he was attended to. And they said to him, That yesterday the seventh hour the fever left him.",

    "John 5:2": "And there is in Jerusalem, at the sheep place a pool, in Hebrew called Bethesda, having five porches.",
    "John 5:3": "In these lay a great multitude of weak, blind, lame, withered, expecting the moving of the water.",
    "John 5:4": "For a messenger at a time went down into the pool, and troubled the water: then he having first stepped in after the troubling of the water became healthy, by whatever malady a long while since he was laid.",
    "John 5:5": "And a certain man was there, being in weakness thirty-eight years.",
    "John 5:6": "Jesus having seen the same lying down, and having known that it was already much time, says to him, Wilt thou be well?",
    "John 5:7": "He being sick answered him, Lord, I have no man, that, when the water was troubled, he might cast me into the pool: and in which I am coming, another steps down before me.",
    "John 5:8": "Jesus says to him, Arise, take up thy couch, and walk.",
    "John 5:9": "And quickly the man was well, and he took up his couch, and walked: and the sabbath was in that day.",
    "John 5:10": "Then said the Jews to him healed, It is the sabbath: it is not lawful for thee to take up thy couch.",
    "John 5:11": "He answered them, He having made me well, the same said to me, Lift up thy couch, and walk.",
    "John 5:12": "Then they asked him, Who is the man having said to thee, Lift up thy couch, and walk?",
    "John 5:13": "And he healed knew not who he is: for Jesus escaped, a crowd being in the place.",
    "John 5:14": "After these, Jesus finds him in the temple, and he said to him, Behold, thou hast become well: sin no more, lest something worse be to thee.",
    "John 5:15": "The man departed, and announced to the Jews that it is Jesus having made him well.",
    "John 5:16": "And therefore the Jews drove out Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these in the sabbath.",
    "John 5:17": "And Jesus answered, My Father works till now, and I work.",
    "John 5:18": "For this therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, for not only did he loose the sabbath, but also he called God his own Father, making himself equal to God.",
    "John 5:19": "Then answered Jesus and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can of himself do nothing, except what he sees the Father doing: for whatever he should do, also these does the Son likewise.",
    "John 5:20": "For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all which himself does: and he will show him greater than these, that ye might wonder.",
    "John 5:21": "For as the Father arouses the dead, and makes alive; so also the Son makes alive whom he will.",
    "John 5:22": "For the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son:",
    "John 5:23": "That all should honour the Son, as they honour the Father. He honouring not the Son, honours not the Father having sent him.",
    "John 5:24": "Truly, truly, I say to you, That he hearing my word, and believing him having sent me, has eternal life, and comes not into judgment; but has passed from death to life.",
    "John 5:25": "Truly, truly, I say to you, That the hour comes, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they hearing shall live.",
    "John 5:26": "For as the Father has life in himself, so also gave he to the Son to have life in himself;",
    "John 5:27": "And gave him authority also to do judgment, because he is the Son of man.",
    "John 5:28": "Wonder not at this: for the hour comes, in which all they in the tombs shall hear his voice, and shall go forth;",
    "John 5:29": "They having done good, to rising up of life; and they having done bad, to rising up of judgment.",
    "John 5:30": "I can do nothing of myself: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; for I seek not my will, but the will of the Father having sent me.",
    "John 5:31": "If I testify of myself, my testimony is not true.",
    "John 5:32": "Another is testifying of me, and I know that the testimony which he testifies of me is true.",
    "John 5:33": "Ye have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.",
    "John 5:34": "But I receive not testimony from man: but these I say that ye might be saved.",
    "John 5:35": "He was a burning and manifest light: and ye wished to rejoice for a time in his light.",
    "John 5:36": "And I have greater testimony than of John: for the works that the Father gave me that I might finish them, the same works that I do, testify of me, that the Father has sent me.",
    "John 5:37": "And the Father having sent me, he has testified of me. Nor have ye at any time heard his voice, or seen his form.",
    "John 5:38": "And his word ye have not remaining in you: for whom he sent, him ye believe not.",
    "John 5:39": "Search the writings; for ye think in them to have eternal life: and these are they testifying of me.",
    "John 5:40": "And ye wish not to come to me, that ye might have life.",
    "John 5:41": "I receive not glory from man.",
    "John 5:42": "But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.",
    "John 5:43": "I have come in the name of my Father, and ye receive me not: if another should come in his own name, him will ye receive.",
    "John 5:44": "How can ye believe, receiving glory from one another, and ye seek not the glory that from God alone?",
    "John 5:45": "Think not that I shall accuse you to the Father: he accusing you is Moses, in whom ye have hoped.",
    "John 5:46": "For if ye had believed Moses, ye had believed me: for he himself wrote of me.",
    "John 5:47": "And if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?",
    "John 6:1": "After these Jesus departed beyond the sea of Galilee, of Tiberias.",
    "John 6:2": "And a great crowd followed him, for they saw his signs which he did upon the sick.",
    "John 6:3": "And Jesus went up into the mount, and sat there with his disciples.",
    "John 6:4": "And the pascha was near, the festival of the Jews.",
    "John 6:5": "Then Jesus having lifted up the eyes, and seen that a great crowd comes to him, says to Philip, Whence shall we buy loaves that these might eat?",
    "John 6:6": "And this he said trying him: for himself knew what he was about to do.",
    "John 6:7": "Philip answered him. Loaves of two hundred drachmas will not suffice them, that each of them should take some little.",
    "John 6:8": "One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, says to him,",
    "John 6:9": "There is one little boy here, who has five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are these among so many?",
    "John 6:10": "And Jesus said, Make the men recline. And there was much grass in the place. Then the men reclined, the number about five thousand.",
    "John 6:11": "And Jesus took the loaves; and having given thanks, distributed to his disciples, and the disciples to the reclining; and likewise of the small fishes, as many as they wished.",
    "John 6:12": "And when they were filled, he says to his disciples, Gather the fragments remaining over, that nothing should be lost.",
    "John 6:13": "Then gathered they, and filled twelve baskets of the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over to them having eaten.",
    "John 6:14": "Then the men, having seen the sign which Jesus did, said, That this is truly the prophet coming into the world.",
    "John 6:15": "Then Jesus having known that they were about to come and carry him of forcibly, that they might make him king, departed again to the mount alone.",
    "John 6:16": "And when it was evening, his disciples went down to the sea.",
    "John 6:17": "And having entered into a ship, they came beyond the sea to Capernaum. And already was there darkness, and Jesus had not come to them.",
    "John 6:18": "And the sea, a great wind blowing, arose.",
    "John 6:19": "Then having urged forward about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they behold Jesus walking upon the sea, and being near the ship: and they were afraid.",
    "John 6:20": "And he says to them, I am; be not afraid.",
    "John 6:21": "Then they wished to take him into the ship: and the ship was quickly at land to which they retired.",
    "John 6:22": "The morrow, the crowd standing beyond the sea having seen that no other small vessel was there, except that one into which his disciples had entered, and that Jesus entered not with his disciples into the small vessel, but his disciples departed alone;",
    "John 6:23": "(But also other small vessels came out of Tiberias near to the place where they ate bread, the Lord having returned thanks:)",
    "John 6:24": "When the crowd therefore saw that Jesus is not there, nor his disciples, they also entered into ships, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.",
    "John 6:25": "And having found them beyond the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when camest thou here?",
    "John 6:26": "Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but for that ye ate of the loaves, and were satisfied.",
    "John 6:27": "Work not for food perishing, but food remaining to eternal life, which the Son of man will give you: for him God the Father sealed.",
    "John 6:28": "Then said they to him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?",
    "John 6:29": "Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that ye should believe in him whom he has sent.",
    "John 6:30": "Then said they to him, What sign doest thou, that we might see, and believe thee? what workest thou?",
    "John 6:31": "Our fathers ate manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.",
    "John 6:32": "Then said Jesus to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses has not given you bread from heaven; but my Father gives you true bread from heaven.",
    "John 6:33": "For the bread of God is he coming down from heaven, and giving life to the world.",
    "John 6:34": "Then said they to him, Lord, always give us this bread.",
    "John 6:35": "And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he coming to me should not hunger; and he believing in me should not thirst.",
    "John 6:36": "But I said to you, That ye have seen me, and believe not.",
    "John 6:37": "All that the Father gives me shall come to me; and he coming to me I will not cast out.",
    "John 6:38": "For I have come down from heaven, not that I might do my will, but the will of him having sent me.",
    "John 6:39": "And this is the will of the Father having sent me, that all which he has given me, I should not loose of it, but raise it up in the last day.",
    "John 6:40": "And this is the will of him having sent me, that every one seeing the Son, and believing in him, should have eternal life: and I will raise him up at the last day.",
    "John 6:41": "Then murmured the Jews about him, because he said, I am the bread having come down from heaven.",
    "John 6:42": "And they said, Is not this Jesus, Joseph’s son, whose father and mother we know? how then says he, That I have come down from heaven?",
    "John 6:43": "Then answered Jesus and said to them, Murmur not with one another.",
    "John 6:44": "None can come to me, except the Father having sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.",
    "John 6:45": "It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every one therefore having heard and learned of the Father, comes to me.",
    "John 6:46": "Not that any one has seen the Father, except he being from God, he has seen the Father.",
    "John 6:47": "Truly, truly, I say to you, he believing in me has eternal life.",
    "John 6:48": "I am the bread of life.",
    "John 6:49": "Your fathers ate manna in the desert, and died.",
    "John 6:50": "This is the bread which coming down from heaven, that whoever should eat of it, and he should not die.",
    "John 6:51": "I am the living bread which having come down from heaven: if any one eat of this bread, he shall live forever: and also the bread which I shall give is my flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world.",
    "John 6:52": "Then the Jews contended with one another, saying, How can he give us the flesh to eat.",
    "John 6:53": "Then said Jesus to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in yourselves.",
    "John 6:54": "He chewing my flesh, and drinking my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.",
    "John 6:55": "For my flesh is truly food, and my blood is truly drink.",
    "John 6:56": "He chewing my flesh, and drinking my blood, remains in me, and I in him.",
    "John 6:57": "As the living Father sent me, and I live through the Father: also he chewing me, the same also shall live through me.",
    "John 6:58": "This is the bread which having come down from heaven: not as your fathers ate manna, and died: he chewing this bread shall live forever.",
    "John 6:59": "He said these, teaching in the synagogue, in Capernaum.",
    "John 6:60": "Then many of his disciples, having heard, said, This is a hard word; who can hear it.",
    "John 6:61": "And Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmur for this, said to them, Does this offend you?",
    "John 6:62": "If then ye see the Son of man going up where he was before.",
    "John 6:63": "It is the spirit making alive; the flesh profits nothing: the words which I speak to you are spirit, and are life.",
    "John 6:64": "But there are some of you who believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they are not believing, and who he is going to deliver him up.",
    "John 6:65": "And he said, Therefore have I said to you, that no one can come to me, except it be given him of my Father.",
    "John 6:66": "From this many of his disciples went away back, and walked no more with him.",
    "John 6:67": "Then said Jesus to the twelve, And ye will not go away?",
    "John 6:68": "Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go away? thou hast the words of eternal life.",
    "John 6:69": "And we have believed, and known, that thou art Christ, Son of the living God.",
    "John 6:70": "Jesus answered them, Have I not chosen you twelve, and of you one is a devil?",
    "John 6:71": "And he spake of Judas Iscariot, of Simon: for he was about to deliver him up, being one of the twelve.",
    "John 7:1": "And Jesus walked after these in Galilee: for he wished not to walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.",
    "John 7:2": "And the festival of the Jews was near, the Pitching of tents.",
    "John 7:3": "Then said his brethren to him, Go away thence, and retire to Judea, that also thy disciples might see thy works which thou doest.",
    "John 7:4": "For none does any thing in secret, and seeks himself to be in freedom of speech. If thou do these, make thyself manifest to the world.",
    "John 7:5": "For neither believed his brethren in him.",
    "John 7:6": "Then says Jesus to them, My time is not yet present: and your time is always ready.",
    "John 7:7": "The world cannot hate you: but me it hates, for I testify of it, that its works are evil.",
    "John 7:8": "Go ye up to this festival: I go not yet up to the festival; for my time has not yet been completed.",
    "John 7:9": "And speaking to them these things, he remained in Galilee.",
    "John 7:10": "And when his brethren went up, then he went up to the festival, not openly, but as in secret.",
    "John 7:11": "Then the Jews sought him in the festival, and said, Where is he.",
    "John 7:12": "And much murmuring was for him in the crowds: some truly said, That he is good: and others said, No; but he deceives the crowd.",
    "John 7:13": "However none spake of him with freedom of speech, for fear of the Jews.",
    "John 7:14": "And now the festival being in the midst, Jesus went up to the temple, and taught.",
    "John 7:15": "And the Jews wondered, saying, How knows he letters, not having learned.",
    "John 7:16": "Jesus answered them, and said, My teaching is not mine, but his having sent me.",
    "John 7:17": "If any desire to do his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or I speak from myself.",
    "John 7:18": "He speaking from himself, seeks his own glory: but he seeking the glory of him having sent him, he is true, and no injustice is in him.",
    "John 7:19": "Has not Moses given you the law, and none of you does the law? Why seek ye to kill me?",
    "John 7:20": "The crowd answered and said, Thou hast a demon: who seeks to kill thee?",
    "John 7:21": "Jesus answered and said to them, I did one work, and ye all marvel for this.",
    "John 7:22": "Moses has given you circumcision; (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and in the sabbath ye circumcise a man.",
    "John 7:23": "If a man receive circumcision in the sabbath, that the law of Moses be not loosed; rage not at me, because I made a man wholly well on the Sabbath.",
    "John 7:24": "Judge not according to sight, but judge just judgment.",
    "John 7:25": "Then said some of the Jerusalemites, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?",
    "John 7:26": "And, behold, he speaks in freedom of speech, and they say nothing to him. Not at any time knew the rulers truly, that this is truly Christ?",
    "John 7:27": "But we know this whence he is: and Christ, when he should come, none knows whence he is.",
    "John 7:28": "Then cried Jesus in the temple, teaching, and saying, And ye know me, and ye know whence I am: and I have not come of myself, but he having sent me is true, whom ye know not.",
    "John 7:29": "But I know him; for I am from him, and he sent me.",
    "John 7:30": "Then sought they to seize him: and none put the hand upon him, for his hour had not yet come.",
    "John 7:31": "And many of the crowd believed on him, and said, That Christ, when he should come, will he do more signs than these which he did?",
    "John 7:32": "The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things of him; and the Pharisees and chief priests sent servants that they might seize him.",
    "John 7:33": "Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little time am I with you, and I retire to him having sent me.",
    "John 7:34": "And ye shall seek me and shall not find: and where I am, ye cannot come.",
    "John 7:35": "Then said the Jews among themselves, Where is he about to go, that we shall not find him? is he not about to go to the dispersion of the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?",
    "John 7:36": "What is the word which he spake, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find: and where I am, ye cannot come?",
    "John 7:37": "In the last day, the great one of the festival, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any thirst, let him come to me, and drink.",
    "John 7:38": "He believing in me, as said the writing, from his belly shall flow rivers of living waters.",
    "John 7:39": "(This spake he of the Spirit which they believing in him were about to receive: for the Holy Spirit was not yet; for Jesus was not yet honoured.)",
    "John 7:40": "Then many of the crowd, having heard the word, said, This is truly a prophet.",
    "John 7:41": "Others said, This is Christ: and others said, Yet Christ comes not out of Galilee.",
    "John 7:42": "Said not the writing, That of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the town where David was, Christ comes?",
    "John 7:43": "Then was there a division in the crowd on his account.",
    "John 7:44": "And some of them wished to seize him; but none put hands upon him.",
    "John 7:45": "Then came the servants to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why did ye not bring him.",
    "John 7:46": "And the servants answered, Never spake man as this man.",
    "John 7:47": "Then the Pharisees answered them, Have ye not also been deceived.",
    "John 7:48": "Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?",
    "John 7:49": "But the crowd, not knowing the law, are cursed.",
    "John 7:50": "Nicodemus says to them, (he having come to him by night, being one of them,)",
    "John 7:51": "Our law judges not a man, except it first hear from him, and know what he does.",
    "John 7:52": "They answered and said to him, And art thou not of Galilee? Search, and see: for a prophet has not risen out of Galilee.",
    "John 7:53": "And each man went to his house.",
    "John 8:1": "And Jesus went to the mount of Olives.",
    "John 8:2": "And again in the morning he was present in the temple, and all the people came to him; and having sat down, he taught them.",
    "John 8:3": "And the scribes and Pharisees brought him a woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the midst,",
    "John 8:4": "They say to him, Teacher, this woman was taken committing adultery, in the very act.",
    "John 8:5": "In the law Moses commanded us such to be stoned: therefore what sayest thou?",
    "John 8:6": "And this said they, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. And Jesus, having stooped down, wrote with his fingers upon the earth.",
    "John 8:7": "And when they continued asking him, having lifted up the head, he said to them, Let him faultless among you, first cast a stone at her.",
    "John 8:8": "And again having stooped down, he wrote upon the earth.",
    "John 8:9": "And they having heard, and being convicted by consciousness, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest even to the last; and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.",
    "John 8:10": "And Jesus having lifted up the head, and seen none but the woman, said to her, Woman, where are they accusing thee? has none condemned thee.",
    "John 8:11": "And she said, None, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.",
    "John 8:12": "Again therefore Jesus spake to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he following me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.",
    "John 8:13": "Then said the Pharisees to him, Thou testifiest of thyself; thy testimony is not true.",
    "John 8:14": "Jesus answered and said to them. Though I testify of myself; my testimony is true: for I know whence I came, and where I retire; but ye know not whence I came and where I retire.",
    "John 8:15": "Ye judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.",
    "John 8:16": "And if I also judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father having sent me.",
    "John 8:17": "And also in your law has it been written, that the testimony of two men is true.",
    "John 8:18": "I am he testifying of myself, and the Father having sent me testifies of me.",
    "John 8:19": "Then said they to him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye had known my Father also.",
    "John 8:20": "These words spake Jesus in the royal treasury, teaching in the temple: and no one seized him; for his hour had not yet come.",
    "John 8:21": "Then said Jesus again to them, I retire, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: where I retire, ye cannot come.",
    "John 8:22": "Then said the Jews, Will he not kill himself? for he says, Where I retire, ye cannot come.",
    "John 8:23": "And he said to them, Ye are from below I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.",
    "John 8:24": "I said therefore to you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am, ye shall die in your sins.",
    "John 8:25": "Then said they to him, Who art thou? And Jesus said to them, In the beginning, he which I spake to you.",
    "John 8:26": "Many things have I to speak and judge of you; but he having sent me is true; and what things I have heard from him these say I to the world.",
    "John 8:27": "They knew not that he spake to them of the Father.",
    "John 8:28": "Then said Jesus to them, When ye lift up the Son of man then shall ye know that I am, and I do nothing of myself; but as my Father taught me, these I speak.",
    "John 8:29": "And he having sent me is with me: the Father has not left me alone; for I do always things pleasing to him.",
    "John 8:30": "He speaking these, many believed in him.",
    "John 8:31": "Then said Jesus to the Jews having believed him, If ye remain in my word, ye are truly my disciples.",
    "John 8:32": "And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.",
    "John 8:33": "They answered him, We are Abraham’s seed, and have never served any; how sayest thou, That ye shall be free?",
    "John 8:34": "Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, say I to you, That every one doing sin, is servant of sin.",
    "John 8:35": "And the servant remains not in the house forever; the Son remains forever.",
    "John 8:36": "If the Son make you free, ye shall be truly free.",
    "John 8:37": "I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, for my word has no place in you.",
    "John 8:38": "I, what I have seen from my Father, speak: and ye, therefore, what ye have seen of your Father, do.",
    "John 8:39": "They answered and said to him, Abraham is our Father. Jesus says to them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye had done Abraham’s works.",
    "John 8:40": "And now ye seek to kill me, a man who has spoken to you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not Abraham.",
    "John 8:41": "Ye do the works of your father. Then said they to him, We have not been born of fornication; for we have one Father, God.",
    "John 8:42": "Then said Jesus to them, If God were your Father, ye had loved me: for I went forth from God, and came; for I have not come of myself, but he sent me.",
    "John 8:43": "Wherefore ye know not my speech, for ye cannot hear my word.",
    "John 8:44": "Ye are of your father the devil, and the eager desires of your father will ye do. He was slaying men from the beginning, and stood not in the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he would speak a lie, he speaks of his own things; for he is a liar, and the father of him.",
    "John 8:45": "And because I say the truth, ye believe me not.",
    "John 8:46": "Which of you convicts me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me.",
    "John 8:47": "He being of God hears the words of God: therefore ye hear not, for ye are not of God.",
    "John 8:48": "Then answered the Jews, and said to him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?",
    "John 8:49": "Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honour my Father, and ye dishonour me.",
    "John 8:50": "And I seek not my glory: there is he seeking and judging.",
    "John 8:51": "Truly, truly, I say to you, If any keep my word, he should never see death.",
    "John 8:52": "Then said the Jews to him, Now we have known that thou hast a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If any keep my word, he shall never taste of death.",
    "John 8:53": "Thou art not greater than our father Abraham, who died; and the prophets died: whom makest thou thyself?",
    "John 8:54": "Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father honouring me; whom ye say, that he is your God:",
    "John 8:55": "And ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like you: but I know him, and keep his word.",
    "John 8:56": "Your father Abraham was overjoyed that he might see my day: and he saw, and rejoiced.",
    "John 8:57": "Then said the Jews to him, Thou hast not yet fifty years, and hast thou seen Abraham.",
    "John 8:58": "And Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham was born, I am.",
    "John 8:59": "Then lifted up they stones that they might cast upon him: and Jesus was hid, and he went forth out of the temple, having passed through the midst of them, and so he passed by.",
    "John 9:1": "And passing by, he saw a man blind from birth.",
    "John 9:2": "And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, he, or his parents, that he was born blind?",
    "John 9:3": "Jesus answered, Neither did this sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God might be manifested in him.",
    "John 9:4": "I must work the works of him having sent me, while it is day: night comes, when none can work.",
    "John 9:5": "While I be in the world, I am the light of the world.",
    "John 9:6": "Having said these, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and rubbed the clay upon the eyes of the blind,",
    "John 9:7": "And said to him, Retire, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is interpreted, Sent.) He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing.",
    "John 9:8": "Then the neighbors, and those seeing him before that he was blind, said, Is not this he sitting and begging?",
    "John 9:9": "Others said, This is he: and others, That he is like him: he said, That I am.",
    "John 9:10": "Then said they to him, How were thine eyes opened?",
    "John 9:11": "He answered and said, A man called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said to me, Retire to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and having gone and washed, I saw again.",
    "John 9:12": "Then said they to him, Where is he? He says I know not.",
    "John 9:13": "They bring him to the Pharisees, him once blind.",
    "John 9:14": "And it was the sabbath, when Jesus made clay, and opened his eyes.",
    "John 9:15": "Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he saw again. He said to them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see.",
    "John 9:16": "Then said certain of the Pharisees, This man is not from God, for he keeps not the sabbath. Others said, How can a sinful man do such signs? And a division was among them.",
    "John 9:17": "They say to the blind again, What sayest thou of him, for he opened thine eyes? He said, That he is a prophet.",
    "John 9:18": "Then the Jews believed not of him that he was blind, and saw again, until they called the parents of him having looked up.",
    "John 9:19": "And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, whom ye say that be was born blind how then does be now see.",
    "John 9:20": "His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:",
    "John 9:21": "But how he now sees, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: he has age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.",
    "John 9:22": "These said his parents, for they feared the Jews: for already had the Jews agreed, that if any should acknowledge him Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.",
    "John 9:23": "Therefore said his parents, That he has age; ask him.",
    "John 9:24": "Then called they the man of a second time, who was blind, and said to him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is sinful.",
    "John 9:25": "He answered and said, If he be sinful, I know not: one thing I know, that, being blind, now I see.",
    "John 9:26": "And again said they to him, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?",
    "John 9:27": "He answered them, I told you already, and ye heard not: why wish ye to hear again? ye wish not also to be his disciples?",
    "John 9:28": "Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses’ disciples.",
    "John 9:29": "We know that God has spoken to Moses; but this, we know not whence he is.",
    "John 9:30": "The man answered and said to them, For in this is it wonderful, that ye know not whence he is, and he opened mine eyes.",
    "John 9:31": "And we know that God hears not the sinful: but if any be godly, and do his will, this he hears.",
    "John 9:32": "From forever was it not heard that any opened the eyes of him born blind.",
    "John 9:33": "If this one were not of God, he could do nothing.",
    "John 9:34": "They answered and said to him, In sins wert thou wholly born, and teachest thou us? And they cast him without.",
    "John 9:35": "Jesus heard that they cast him without; and having found him, said to him, Believest thou in the Son of God?",
    "John 9:36": "He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe in him?",
    "John 9:37": "And Jesus said to him, Thou hast also seen him, and he speaking with thee, the same is he.",
    "John 9:38": "And he said I believe, Lord. And he worshipped him.",
    "John 9:39": "And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world, that they not seeing might see; and they seeing might be blind.",
    "John 9:40": "And they being with him of the Pharisees heard these things, and said to him,",
    "John 9:41": "We are not also blind? Jesus said to them If ye were blind, ye had not sinned: and now ye say, That we see; therefore your sin remains.",
    "John 10:1": "Truly, truly, I say to you, He not coming in through the door into the court-yard of the sheep, but coming up from another place, he is a thief and robber.",
    "John 10:2": "And he coming in through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.",
    "John 10:3": "To him the guard of the door opens; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.",
    "John 10:4": "And when he would put forth his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.",
    "John 10:5": "And a stranger they would not follow, but they will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.",
    "John 10:6": "This proverb spake Jesus to then: and they knew not what things they were which he spake to them.",
    "John 10:7": "Then said Jesus again to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, That I am the door of the sheep.",
    "John 10:8": "All who came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep heard them not.",
    "John 10:9": "I am the door: if any come in through me, he shall be saved, and he shall me in, and go out, and find pasture.",
    "John 10:10": "The thief comes not, except that he steal, and sacrifice, and destroy: I came that they might have life, and have above measure.",
    "John 10:11": "I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.",
    "John 10:12": "But the hired one, and not being the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and he leaves the sheep, and flees: and the wolf plunders them, and scatters the sheep.",
    "John 10:13": "The hired flees, because he is hired, and no care is to him for the sheep.",
    "John 10:14": "I am the good shepherd, and I know mine, and am known by mine.",
    "John 10:15": "As the Father knows me, I also know the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.",
    "John 10:16": "And I have, other sheep, which are not of this court-yard: and I must also bring them, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one flock, and one shepherd.",
    "John 10:17": "Therefore does my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.",
    "John 10:18": "No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This command received I of my Father.",
    "John 10:19": "Then was a division again among the Jews for these words.",
    "John 10:20": "And many of them said, He has a demon, and is frenzied; why hear ye him?",
    "John 10:21": "Others said, These are not the words of a demon. A demon cannot open the eyes of the blind.",
    "John 10:22": "And there was the festival of inauguration among the Jerusalemites, and it was winter.",
    "John 10:23": "And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch.",
    "John 10:24": "Then the Jews surrounded him, and said to him, How long takest thou away our soul? If thou art Christ, say to us with freedom of speech.",
    "John 10:25": "Jesus answered them, I said to you, and ye believe not: the works which I do in my Father’s name, these testify of me.",
    "John 10:26": "But ye believe not, for ye are not of my sheep, as I said to you.",
    "John 10:27": "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.",
    "John 10:28": "And I give them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand.",
    "John 10:29": "My Father, who has given to me, is greater than all; and no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand.",
    "John 10:30": "I and my Father are one.",
    "John 10:31": "Then again lifted up the Jews stones that they might stone him.",
    "John 10:32": "Jesus Answered them, Many good works I shewed you from my Father; for which of these works do ye stone me.",
    "John 10:33": "The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and that thou, being man, makest thyself God.",
    "John 10:34": "Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said; Ye are gods?",
    "John 10:35": "If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came, and the writing cannot be loosed;",
    "John 10:36": "Whom the Father consecrated, and sent into the world, say ye that thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God.",
    "John 10:37": "If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.",
    "John 10:38": "And if I do, though ye believe me not, believe the works: that ye might know, and believe, that the Father in me, and I in him.",
    "John 10:39": "Then sought they again to take him: and he went out from their hand,",
    "John 10:40": "And again he departed beyond Jordan to the place where John was first immersing; and he remained there.",
    "John 10:41": "And many came to him, and said, That truly John did no sign: but all which John said of him was true.",
    "John 10:42": "And many believed in him there.",
    "John 11:1": "And a certain Lazarus was sick, from Bethany, of the town of Mary And Martha her sister.",
    "John 11:2": "(And Mary was she having anointed the Lord with perfumed oil, and wiped his feet with her hairs, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)",
    "John 11:3": "Then sent the sisters to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.",
    "John 11:4": "And Jesus having heard, said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that by it the Son of God be honoured.",
    "John 11:5": "And Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.",
    "John 11:6": "When therefore he heard that he is sick, then indeed he remained in the place in which he was two days.",
    "John 11:7": "Then after this he says to his disciples, Let us go into Judea again.",
    "John 11:8": "The disciples say to him, Rabbi, now the Jews sought to stone thee; and retirest thou there again?",
    "John 11:9": "Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours of the day? If any walk in the day, he stumbles not, for he sees the light of this world.",
    "John 11:10": "But if any walk in the night, he stumbles, for light is not in him.",
    "John 11:11": "These things said he: and after this he says to them, Lazarus our friend has been set to sleep; but I go, that I might waken him.",
    "John 11:12": "Then said his disciples, Lord, if he has been set to sleep, he shall be saved.",
    "John 11:13": "And Jesus spake of his death: but these supposed that he speaks of the repose of sleep.",
    "John 11:14": "Then therefore Jesus said to them with freedom of speech, Lazarus is dead.",
    "John 11:15": "And I rejoice for you, that ye might believe, that I was not there; but let us go to him.",
    "John 11:16": "Then said Thomas, called Didymus, to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we might die with him.",

    "John 11:24": "Martha says to him, I know that he shall rise at the rising up in the last day.",
    "John 11:25": "Jesus said to her, I am the rising up, and life: he believing in me, though he die, shall live.",
    "John 11:26": "And all living and believing in me should never die. Believest thou this?",
    "John 11:27": "She says to him, Yes, Lord: I have believed that thou art Christ, the Son of God, he coming into the world.",

    "John 11:29": "She, when she heard, arises quickly, and comes to him.",
    "John 11:30": "And Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in the place where Martha met him.",
    "John 11:31": "Then the Jews being in the house with her, and consoling her, having seen Mary, that she rose quickly and went forth, followed her, saying, That she retires to the tomb, that she might weep there.",
    "John 11:32": "Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was, seeing him, fell at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou wert here, my brother had not died.",
    "John 11:33": "Then Jesus, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping having come with her, was heavy in spirit, and troubled himself,",
    "John 11:34": "And said, Where have ye laid him? They say to him, Lord, come and see.",
    "John 11:35": "Jesus wept.",
    "John 11:36": "Then said the Jews, See how he loved him!",
    "John 11:37": "And certain of them said, Could not he having opened the eyes of the blind, have made that this should not die?",

    "John 11:39": "Jesus says, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the dead, says to him, Lord, he already smells: for it is the fourth day.",
    "John 11:40": "Jesus says to her, Said I not to thee, if thou shouldest believe, thou shalt see the glory of God.",
    "John 11:41": "Then took they away the stone where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes above, and said, Father, I return thee thanks that thou didst hear me.",
    "John 11:42": "And I knew that thou always hearest me: but for the crowd standing round I said, that they might believe that thou didst send me.",
    "John 11:43": "And having said these, he cried out with a great voice, Lazarus, come out.",
    "John 11:44": "And the dead came out, bound feet and hands with bandages; and his face was bound with a napkin. Jesus says to them, Loose him, and let him retire.",
    "John 11:45": "Then many of the Jews, having come to Mary, and seeing what Jesus did, believed in him.",
    "John 11:46": "But certain of them departed to the Pharisees, and said to them what Jesus did.",
    "John 11:47": "Then gathered together the chief priests and Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man does many signs.",
    "John 11:48": "If we let him thus go, all will believe on him: and the Romans will come and take away also our place and nation.",
    "John 11:49": "And a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being chief priest that year, said to them, Ye know nothing,",
    "John 11:50": "Neither turn ye in your thoughts that it is profitable to us, that one man die for the people, and the nation perish not.",
    "John 11:51": "And this he said not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation;",
    "John 11:52": "And not for the nation alone, but that also the children of God, scattered, should be gathered into one.",
    "John 11:53": "Then from that day they counselled together that they might kill him.",
    "John 11:54": "Jesus then walked no more with freedom of speech among the Jews; but departed thence to the country near the desert, to a city called Ephraim, and there he tarried with his disciples.",
    "John 11:55": "And the Jews’ pascha was near: and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the pascha, that they might purify themselves.",
    "John 11:56": "Then sought they Jesus, and said with one another, standing in the temple, What seems it to you, that he should not come to the festival.",
    "John 11:57": "And also the chief priests and Pharisees had given a command, that if any know where he is, he should make known, that they might take him.",
    "John 12:1": "Then Jesus, six days before the pascha, came to Bethany, where was Lazarus the dead, whom he raised from the dead.",
    "John 12:2": "Then made they him a supper there, and Martha served; and Lazarus was one of them reclining at table with him.",
    "John 12:3": "Then Mary having taken a pound of perfumed oil of spikenard, very precious, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hairs: and the house was filled with the smell of the perfumed oil.",
    "John 12:4": "Then says one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, of Simon, being about to deliver him up,",
    "John 12:5": "Wherefore was not this perfumed oil sold for three hundred drachmas, and given to the poor?",
    "John 12:6": "And this he said, not that care was to him for the poor: but because he was a thief, and had the small coffer, and carried things deposited.",
    "John 12:7": "Then said Jesus, Let her go; for the day of my interment has she kept this.",
    "John 12:8": "For the poor have ye always with you; and me ye have not always.",
    "John 12:9": "Then a great crowd of Jews knew that he is there: and they came not for Jesus alone, but that also they might see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.",
    "John 12:10": "And the chief priests took counsel that they might also kill Lazarus;",
    "John 12:11": "Because many for him retired, and believed in Jesus.",
    "John 12:12": "The morrow a great crowd, having come to the festival, having heard that Jesus comes to Jerusalem,",
    "John 12:13": "Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to the meeting to him, and cried, Praised he coming in the name of the Lord, King of Israel.",
    "John 12:14": "And Jesus having found a small ass, sat upon it; as it is written,",
    "John 12:15": "Fear not, O daughter of Sion: behold, thy King comes, sitting upon the foal of an ass.",
    "John 12:16": "And these the disciples knew not at first: but when Jesus was honoured, then remembered they that these were written of him, and they did these things to him.",
    "John 12:17": "The crowd therefore testified which being with him, that he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead.",
    "John 12:18": "And for this the crowd met him, for they heard he had done this sign.",
    "John 12:19": "Then said the Pharisees among themselves, Ye see that ye aid nothing; behold, the world has departed after him.",
    "John 12:20": "And there were certain Greeks of those going up that they might worship in the festival:",
    "John 12:21": "These then came to Philip, him of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Lord, we wish to see Jesus.",
    "John 12:22": "Philip comes and says to Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip say to Jesus.",
    "John 12:23": "And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come, that the Son of man should be honoured.",
    "John 12:24": "Truly, truly, I say to you, except a kernel of wheat, having fallen into the earth, should die, it remains alone: and if it should die, it brings forth much fruit.",
    "John 12:25": "He loving his soul shall lose it; but he hating his soul in this world, shall guard it for life eternal.",
    "John 12:26": "If any one would serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall be my servant: and if any one serve me, him will the Father honour.",
    "John 12:27": "Now has my soul been troubled; and what should I say? O Father, save me from this hour: but for this came I to this hour.",
    "John 12:28": "Father, honour thy name. Then came a voice from heaven, I have also honoured, and will again honour.",
    "John 12:29": "Then the crowd, having stood and heard, said it was thunder: others said, A messenger has spoken to him.",
    "John 12:30": "Jesus answered and said, This voice has not been for me, but for you.",
    "John 12:31": "Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the ruler of this world be cast out.",
    "John 12:32": "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all to myself.",
    "John 12:33": "This said he, signifying what death he was about to die.",
    "John 12:34": "The crowd answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ remains forever: and how sayest thou That the Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?",
    "John 12:35": "Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little time the light is with you. Walk while ye have light, lest darkness overtake you: and he walking in darkness knows not where he retires.",
    "John 12:36": "While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye might be the sons of light. These things spake Jesus, and having departed, he was hid from them.",
    "John 12:37": "And he having done so many signs before them, they did not believe in him:",
    "John 12:38": "That the word of Esaias the prophet might be completed, which he spake, Lord, who believed our report? and to whom was the arm of the Lord revealed?",
    "John 12:39": "Therefore they could not believe, for Esaias said again,",
    "John 12:40": "He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart: lest they see with the eyes, and understand with the heart, and should turn back, and I should heal them.",
    "John 12:41": "These said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.",
    "John 12:42": "Yet nevertheless also many of the rulers believed in him; but on account of the Pharisees they did not acknowledge, lest they should be excluded from the synagogue:",
    "John 12:43": "For they loved the honour of men more than the honour of God.",
    "John 12:44": "Jesus cried and said, He believing in me, believes not in me, but in him having sent me.",
    "John 12:45": "And he seeing me, sees him having sent me.",
    "John 12:46": "I have come a light into the world, that every one believing in me should not remain in darkness.",
    "John 12:47": "And if any hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not that I might judge the world, but that I might save the world.",
    "John 12:48": "He rejecting me, and not receiving my words, has him judging him: the word which I spake, that shall judge him in the last day.",
    "John 12:49": "For I spake not of myself; but the Father having sent me, he gave me a command, what I should say, and what I should speak.",
    "John 12:50": "And I know that his command is life eternal: therefore what I speak, as the Father said to me, so I speak.",
    "John 13:1": "And before the feast of the pascha, Jesus knowing that his hour had come that he should pass out of this world to the Father, having loved his own in the world, he loved them to the end.",
    "John 13:2": "And supper having been, the devil having already cast into the heart of Judas Iscariot, of Simon, that he should deliver him up;",
    "John 13:3": "Jesus knowing that the Father has given all things to him into the hands, and that he came out from God, and retired to God;",
    "John 13:4": "He arises from supper, and lays down the garments; and having taken a linen cloth, he girded himself.",
    "John 13:5": "Then casts he water into a washing vessel, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe with the linen cloth with which he was girded.",
    "John 13:6": "And he comes to Simon Peter: and he says to him, Lord, washest thou my feet?",
    "John 13:7": "Jesus answered and said to him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know after these.",
    "John 13:8": "Peter says to him, Thou shouldest never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, Except I wash thee, thou hast no part with me.",
    "John 13:9": "Simon Peter says to him, Lord, not my feet only, but the hands and head.",
    "John 13:10": "Jesus says to him, He washed has no need but to have the feet washed, but is wholly clean: and ye are clean, but not all.",
    "John 13:11": "For he knew him delivering him up, therefore he said, Ye are not all clean.",
    "John 13:12": "When therefore he washed their feet; and took his garments, going to recline again, he said to them, Knew ye what I have done to you?",
    "John 13:13": "Ye call one Teacher and Lord: and ye say well; for I am.",
    "John 13:14": "If therefore, I washed your feet, the Lord and Teacher; ye also ought to wash the feet of one another:",
    "John 13:15": "For I have given you a pattern, as I have done to you, also should ye do.",
    "John 13:16": "Truly, truly I say to you, The servant is not greater than his Lord; neither the sent greater than he having sent him.",
    "John 13:17": "If ye know these, happy are ye if ye do them.",
    "John 13:18": "I say not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the writing might be completed, He chewing bread with me lifted up his heel against me.",
    "John 13:19": "From now I say to you, before it shall be, that, when it should be, ye might believe that I am.",
    "John 13:20": "Truly, truly, I say to you, He receiving whomsoever I shall send receives me; and he receiving me receives him having sent me.",
    "John 13:21": "These things Jesus having spoken, was troubled in spirit, and he testified, and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you shall deliver me up.",
    "John 13:22": "Then looked the disciples one upon another, being perplexed of whom he spake.",
    "John 13:23": "And there was one of his disciples reclining on the bosom of Jesus, whom he loved.",
    "John 13:24": "Then Simon Peter nodded to this one, to inquire who it might be of whom he speaks.",
    "John 13:25": "And he reclining upon Jesus’ breast says to him, Lord, who is it?",
    "John 13:26": "Jesus answers, This is he to whom I, having dipped a small morsel, shall bestow. And having dipped the small morsel, he gives to Judas Iscariot, of Simon.",
    "John 13:27": "And after the small morsel then came Satan into him. Then says Jesus to him, What thou doest, do quickly.",
    "John 13:28": "And this none of the reclining knew for what he said to him.",
    "John 13:29": "For some thought, since Judas had the small coffer, that Jesus says to him, Purchase of what we have need for the festival; or, that he might give something to the poor.",
    "John 13:30": "He having taken the small morsel went quickly forth: and it was night when he then went forth.",
    "John 13:31": "Jesus says, Now was the Son of man honoured, and God was honoured in him.",
    "John 13:32": "If God were honoured in him, also shall God honour him in himself, and quickly shall he honour him.",
    "John 13:33": "Little children, yet a little am I with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said to the Jews, That where I retire, ye cannot come; and I say to you now.",
    "John 13:34": "A new command give I to you, That ye love one another: as I loved you, that ye also love one another.",
    "John 13:35": "In this all shall know that ye are disciples to me, if ye have love in one another.",
    "John 13:36": "Simon Peter says to him, Lord, where retirest thou? Jesus answered him, Where I retire, thou shalt not be able to follow me now; and afterwards thou shalt follow me.",
    "John 13:37": "Peter says to him, Lord, why can I not follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee.",
    "John 13:38": "Jesus answered, Wilt thou lay down thy life for me Truly, truly, I say to thee, The cock shall not utter a sound, till thou deny me thrice.",
    "John 14:1": "Let not your heart be troubled: believe in God, and believe in me.",
    "John 14:2": "In my Father’s house are many dwellings: and if not, I had said to you. I go to prepare a place for you.",
    "John 14:3": "And if I go and prepare a place for you, again I come, and I will receive you to myself; that where I am, ye might be also.",
    "John 14:4": "And where I retire ye know, and the way ye know.",
    "John 14:5": "Thomas says to him, Lord, we know not where thou retirest; and how can we know the way?",
    "John 14:6": "Jesus says to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one comes to the Father, except by me.",
    "John 14:7": "If ye had known me, ye had also known my Father: and from now ye know, and have seen him.",
    "John 14:8": "Philip says to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it suffices us.",

    "John 14:10": "Believest thou not that I in the Father, and the Father is in me? the words which I speak to you, I speak not of myself: and the Father remaining in me does the works.",
    "John 14:11": "Believe ye me that I in the Father, and the Father in me: and if not, for these works believe me.",
    "John 14:12": "Truly, truly, I say to you, He believing in me, the works which I do shall he do also; and greater than these shall he do; for I go to my Father.",

    "John 14:21": "He having my commands, and keeping them, the same is he loving me: and he loving me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and manifest myself to him.",
    "John 14:22": "Judas says to him, not Iscariot, Lord, how has it been that thou art about to make thyself manifest to us, and not to the world?",
    "John 14:23": "Jesus answered and said to him, If any one love me, he will keep my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and we will make our stay with him.",
    "John 14:24": "He not loving me will not keep my words: and the word which ye hear is not of me, but of the Father having sent me.",
    "John 14:25": "These have I spoken to you, remaining with you.",
    "John 14:26": "But the Intercessor, the Holy Spirit, which the Father will send in my name, the same shall teach you all things, and he shall remind you of all things which I spake to you.",

    "John 18:36": "Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, my servants had contended, that I be not delivered to the Jews; and now my kingdom is not hence.",
    "John 18:37": "Then said Pilate to him, Art thou not then king? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am king. For this was I born, and for this came I into the world, that I testify to the truth. Every one being of the truth hears my voice.",

    "John 19:11": "Jesus answered, Thou hast no power against me, if it were not given thee from above: therefore he delivering me to thee has greater sin.",
    "John 19:12": "From this Pilate sought to loose him: and the Jews cried out, saying, If thou loose this, thou art not Caesar’s friend: every one making himself a king speaks against Caesar.",

    "John 19:24": "Then said they to one another, Let us not divide it, but let us draw lots for it, whose it shall be: that the writing might be completed, saying, They divided my garments to themselves, and upon my clothing cast they the lot. Then truly did the soldiers these things.",
    "John 19:25": "And by the cross of Jesus stood his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.",
    "John 19:26": "Jesus then having seen the mother, and the disciple standing near, whom he loved, says to his mother, Woman, behold thy son!",
