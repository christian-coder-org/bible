    "Mark 7:17": "And when he came into the house from the crowd, his disciples asked him of the parable.",
    "Mark 7:18": "And he says, So are ye also without understanding? Do ye not perceive, that anything from without entering into a man, cannot pollute him.",
    "Mark 7:19": "For it goes not into the heart, but into the belly, and goes forth into the privy, purging all food.",
    "Mark 7:20": "And he said, That going out of a man, that pollutes a man.",
    "Mark 7:21": "For within, out of the heart of men, go forth evil reflections, adulteries, fornications, murders,",
    "Mark 7:22": "Thefts, overreaching, deceit, licentiousness, an evil eye, defamation, pride, foolishness:",
    "Mark 7:23": "All these evils go out from within, and pollute a man.",
    "Mark 7:24": "And arising from thence, he departed into the bounds of Tyre and Sidon, and having come into the house, he would have none know; and he could not be hid.",
    "Mark 7:25": "For a woman having heard of him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, having come, fell at his feet:",
    "Mark 7:26": "And the woman was a Grecian, a Syrophenician by birth; and she entreated him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.",
    "Mark 7:27": "And Jesus said to her, Permit the children first to be satisfied; for it is not good to take the children’s bread, and cast to little dogs.",
    "Mark 7:28": "And she answered and says to him, Yes, Lord: for also the little dogs under the table eat from the children’s crumbs.",
    "Mark 7:29": "And he said to her, For this word retire; the demon has gone out of thy daughter.",
    "Mark 7:30": "And having departed to her house, she found the demon gone forth, and the daughter cast upon the bed.",
    "Mark 7:31": "And again, having gone out from the bounds of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, in the midst of the bounds of Decapolis.",
    "Mark 7:32": "And they bring to him a deaf one, tongue-tied; and they beseech him that he would put the hand upon him.",
    "Mark 7:33": "And having taken him away from the crowd apart, he put his fingers in his ears, and having spit, he touched his tongue;",
    "Mark 7:34": "And having looked up to heaven, he sighed, and says to him, Ephphatha, which is, Be opened.",
    "Mark 7:35": "And quickly his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake rightly.",
    "Mark 7:36": "And he charged them that they should say to none: and as much as he charged them, they proclaimed more abundantly;",
    "Mark 7:37": "And above measure were they struck with amazement, saying, Well has he done all things: he makes the deaf to hear, and the speechless to speak.",
    "Mark 8:1": "In those days the crowd being very many, and having nothing they might eat, Jesus having called his disciples, says to them,",
    "Mark 8:2": "I feel compassion for the crowd, for already they remain three days with me, and have nothing they might eat:",
    "Mark 8:3": "And if I loose them fasting to their house, they will be relaxed in the way: for some of them have come from far.",
    "Mark 8:4": "And his disciples answered him, Whence might anyone be able to satisfy these with loaves here in the lonely place?",
    "Mark 8:5": "And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.",
    "Mark 8:6": "And he enjoined to the crowd to recline upon the earth: and having taken the seven loaves, having returned thanks, he brake, and he gave to his disciples that they might set before; and they set before the crowd.",
    "Mark 8:7": "And they had a few little fishes: and having praised, he spake to set them also before.",
    "Mark 8:8": "And they ate, and were satisfied: and they took up the remains of the fragments, seven wicker baskets.",
    "Mark 8:9": "And they eating were about four thousand: and he loosed them.",
    "Mark 8:10": "And quickly having gone into the ship with his disciples, he came into the parts of Dalmanutha.",
    "Mark 8:11": "And the Pharisees came out, and began to search out with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.",
    "Mark 8:12": "And having sighed deeply in spirit, he says, Why seeks this generation for a sign Verily I say to you, shall a sign be given to this generation.",
    "Mark 8:13": "And having let them go, having gone again into the ship, he departed beyond.",
    "Mark 8:14": "And they forgot to take loaves, and had not but one loaf with them in the ship.",
    "Mark 8:15": "And he enjoined them, saying, See ye, look away from the leaven of the Pharisees, and the leaven of Herod.",
    "Mark 8:16": "And they reasoned with one another, saying, Because we have no loaves.",
    "Mark 8:17": "And Jesus having known, says to them, Why reason ye with yourselves, because ye have no loaves? observe ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?",
    "Mark 8:18": "Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and remember ye not?",
    "Mark 8:19": "When I brake the five loaves to five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say to him, Twelve.",
    "Mark 8:20": "And when the seven to four thousand, the fillings of how many baskets of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.",
    "Mark 8:21": "And he said to them, How do ye not understand.",
    "Mark 8:22": "And he comes to Bethsaida; and they bring to him one blind, and beseech him that he would touch him.",
    "Mark 8:23": "And having taken the hand of the blind, he led him forth without the town; and having spit into his eyes, having put hands upon him, he asked him if he saw any thing.",
    "Mark 8:24": "And having looked up, he said, I see men that I see as trees, walking.",
    "Mark 8:25": "Then again he put hands upon his eyes, and made him look up; and he was restored, and he saw all clearly.",
    "Mark 8:26": "And he sent him to his house, saying, Thou shouldest not either enter into the town, neither, say to any in the town.",
    "Mark 8:27": "And Jesus went out, and his disciples, to the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and he asked his disciples in the way, saying to them, Whom do men say me to be?",
    "Mark 8:28": "And they answered, John the Immerser: and some, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.",
    "Mark 8:29": "And he says to them, And whom do ye say me to be? And Peter, having answered, says to him, Thou art Christ.",
    "Mark 8:30": "And he rebuked them, that they should say to none concerning him.",
    "Mark 8:31": "And he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be disapproved of by the elders, and the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise up.",
    "Mark 8:32": "And he spake the word with frankness. And Peter having taken him, began to rebuke him.",
    "Mark 8:33": "And he having turned back, and having seen his disciples, rebuked Peter, saying, Retire behind me, Satan: for thou hast not in mind the things of God, but the things of men.",
    "Mark 8:34": "And having called the crowd with his disciples, he said to them, Whoever wills to come after me, let him absolutely deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.",
    "Mark 8:35": "For whoever wills to save his life shall lose it; and whoever should lose his life for my sake and the good news, the same shall save it.",
    "Mark 8:36": "For what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and injure his soul.",
    "Mark 8:37": "Or what shall a man give for the exchange of his soul?",
    "Mark 8:38": "For whoever should be ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; also the Son of man shall be ashamed of him, when he should come in the glory of the Father with the holy messengers.",
    "Mark 9:1": "And he said to them, Truly I say to you, That some of those are standing here, who should not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God having come in power.",
    "Mark 9:2": "And after six days Jesus takes Peter, and James, and John, and brings them up into a high mountain apart alone: and he was transformed before them.",
    "Mark 9:3": "And his garments were shining, exceeding white, such as no fuller on earth can make white.",
    "Mark 9:4": "And Elias was seen to them, with Moses: and they were speaking together with Jesus.",
    "Mark 9:5": "And Peter having answered, says to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tents; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.",
    "Mark 9:6": "For he knew not what he said; for they were terrified.",
    "Mark 9:7": "And a cloud was overshadowing them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my dearly beloved Son: hear ye him.",
    "Mark 9:8": "And suddenly, having looked around, they no more saw any one, but Jesus alone with them.",
    "Mark 9:9": "And they coming down from the mount, he charged them that they recount to none what they saw, except when the Son of man should arise from the dead.",
    "Mark 9:10": "And they held the word firmly to themselves, searching out together what it is to arise from the dead.",
    "Mark 9:11": "And having asked him, saying, That the scribes say that Elias must first come.",
    "Mark 9:12": "And he having answered, said to them, Elias truly having first come, restores all things; and how it has been written of the Son of man, that he suffer many things; and be set at nought.",
    "Mark 9:13": "But I say to you, that Elias also has come, and they did to him whatever they would, as it has been written of him.",
    "Mark 9:14": "And having come to the disciples, he saw a great crowd about them, and the scribes seeking out with them.",
    "Mark 9:15": "And immediately all the crowd; having seen him, were amazed, and running near greeted him.",
    "Mark 9:16": "And he asked the scribes, What seek ye together with them?",
    "Mark 9:17": "And one from the crowd having answered, said, Teacher, I have brought my son to thee, having a speechless spirit.",
    "Mark 9:18": "And wherever he overtakes him, he rends him: and he foams, and gnashes his teeth, and he is dried up: and I spake to thy disciples that they might cast him out; and they could not.",
    "Mark 9:19": "And he having answered, says to him, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you how long shall I bear with you? bring him to me.",
    "Mark 9:20": "And they brought him to him: and having seen him, quickly the spirit rent him; and having fallen upon the earth, foaming he rolled himself about.",
    "Mark 9:21": "And he asked his father, How long is it that this has been to him? And he said, From childhood.",
    "Mark 9:22": "And many times also it cast him into fire, and into water, that it might destroy him; but if thou canst anything, help us, having had compassion upon us.",
    "Mark 9:23": "And Jesus said to him, If thou canst believe, all things possible to him believing.",
    "Mark 9:24": "And quickly the child’s father having cried out with tears, said, I believe, O Lord, help thou mine unbelief.",
    "Mark 9:25": "And Jesus, having seen that the crowd ran together, rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, Speechless and deaf spirit, I command thee to come out of him, and that thou come no more into him.",
    "Mark 9:26": "And having cried and rent him much, it came forth, and he was as dead; so that many said, That he is dead.",
    "Mark 9:27": "And Jesus having held him by the hand, raised him; and he stood up.",
    "Mark 9:28": "And he having come into the house, his disciples asked him apart, Wherefore were we not able to cast him forth?",
    "Mark 9:29": "And he said to them, This kind can go, out by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.",
    "Mark 9:30": "And having come out thence they passed through Galilee; and he desired not that any one should know.",
    "Mark 9:31": "For he taught his disciples, and said to them, That the Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and having been killed, he shall raise himself the third day.",
    "Mark 9:32": "And they knew not the word, and were afraid to ask him.",
    "Mark 9:33": "And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What reasoned ye to yourselves in the way.",
    "Mark 9:34": "And they were silent; for they discussed to one another in the way, who the greatest.",
    "Mark 9:35": "And having sat down, he called the twelve, and says to them, If any wish to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.",
    "Mark 9:36": "And having taken a young child, he set him in the midst of them: and having taken it up in his arms, he said to them,",
    "Mark 9:37": "Whoever should receive ones of such young children in my name, receives me: and whoever should receive me, receives not me, but him sending me.",
    "Mark 9:38": "And John answered him, saying, Teacher, we saw a certain one casting out demons in thy name, who follows not us: and we checked him, for he follows not us.",
    "Mark 9:39": "And Jesus said, Check him not: for there is no one who shall do power in my name, and shall be able quickly to revile me.",
    "Mark 9:40": "For whoever is not against us, is for us.",
    "Mark 9:41": "For whoever should give you to drink a cup of water in my name, because ye are of Christ, verily I say to you, he should not lose his reward.",
    "Mark 9:42": "And whoever should scandalize one of these little ones believing in me, it is good for him rather if a millstone is put about his neck, and he be cast into the sea.",
    "Mark 9:43": "And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off; it is good for thee rather to enter into life maimed, than having two hands, to go away into hell, into inextinguishable fire:",
    "Mark 9:44": "Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.",
    "Mark 9:45": "And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life lame, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into inextinguishable fire:",
    "Mark 9:46": "Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.",
    "Mark 9:47": "And if thine eye offend thee, cast it out: it is good for thee, one-eyed, to come into the kingdom of God, than having two eyes to be cast into a hell of fire:",
    "Mark 9:48": "Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.",
    "Mark 9:49": "For all shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.",
    "Mark 9:50": "Salt good: but if the salt be saltless, with what will ye prepare it? Have salt in yourselves, and live in peace one with another.",
    "Mark 10:1": "And having risen from thence, he comes into the bounds of Judea, through the other side of Jordan: and crowds came together again to him; and, as he was accustomed, again he taught them.",

    "Mark 10:3": "And he, having answered, said to them, What did Moses command you?",
    "Mark 10:4": "And they said, Moses permitted to write a bill of divorce, and to loose.",
    "Mark 10:5": "And Jesus, having answered, said to them, For your hard heart he wrote you this command.",
    "Mark 10:6": "And from the beginning of creation God made them male and female.",
    "Mark 10:7": "For this will a man leave his father and mother, and be attached to his wife;",
    "Mark 10:8": "And they two shall be in one flesh: so that they are no more two, but one flesh.",
    "Mark 10:9": "What therefore God yoked together, let not man separate.",
    "Mark 10:10": "And again in the house, his disciples asked him of the same.",

    "Mark 10:15": "Truly I say to you, Whoever should not receive the kingdom of God as a young child, should not come into it.",
    "Mark 10:16": "And having taken them up in his arms, having put the hands upon them, he praised them.",
    "Mark 10:17": "And he going in the way, one running and having fallen upon his knees, asked him, Good teacher, What shall I do that I might inherit eternal life.",
    "Mark 10:18": "And Jesus said to him, Why sayest thou me good? none good, except the one God.",
    "Mark 10:19": "Thou knowest the commands: Thou shouldst not commit adultery; Thou shouldst not kill; Thou shouldst not steal; Thou shouldst not bear false testimony; Thou shouldst not defraud; Honour thy father and mother.",
    "Mark 10:20": "And he, having answered, said to him, O teacher, all these have I watched from my youth.",
    "Mark 10:21": "And Jesus having looked upon him, loved him, and said to him, One thing is wanting to thee retire; whatever thou hast, sell, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, having taken up the cross.",
