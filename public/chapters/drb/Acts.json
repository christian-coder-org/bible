    "Mark 7:5": "And the Pharisees and scribes asked him: Why do not thy disciples walk according to the tradition of the ancients, but they eat bread with common hands?",
    "Mark 7:6": "But he answering, said to them: Well did Isaias prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.",
    "Mark 7:7": "And in vain to they worship me, teaching doctrines and precepts of men.",
    "Mark 7:8": "For leaving the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, the washing of pots and of cups: and many other things you do like to these.",
    "Mark 7:9": "And he said to them: Well do you make void the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition.",
    "Mark 7:10": "For Moses said: Honor thy father and thy mother; and He that shall curse father or mother, dying let him die.",
    "Mark 7:11": "But you say: If a man shall say to his father or mother, Corban, (which is a gift,) whatsoever is from me, shall profit thee.",
    "Mark 7:12": "And further you suffer him not to do any thing for his father or mother,",
    "Mark 7:13": "Making void the word of God by your own tradition, which you have given forth. And many other such like things you do.",
    "Mark 7:14": "And calling again the multitude unto him, he said to them: Hear ye me all, and understand.",
    "Mark 7:15": "There is nothing from without a man that entering into him, can defile him. But the things which come from a man, those are they that defile a man.",
    "Mark 7:16": "If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.",
    "Mark 7:17": "And when he was come into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked him the parable.",
    "Mark 7:18": "And he saith to them: So are you also without knowledge? understand you not that every thing from without, entering into a man cannot defile him:",
    "Mark 7:19": "Because it entereth not into his heart, but goeth into the belly, and goeth out into the privy, purging all meats?",
    "Mark 7:20": "But he said that the things which come out from a man, they defile a man.",
    "Mark 7:21": "For from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,",
    "Mark 7:22": "Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness.",
    "Mark 7:23": "All these evil things come from within, and defile a man.",
    "Mark 7:24": "And rising from thence he went into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon: and entering into a house, he would that no man should know it, and he could not be hid.",
    "Mark 7:25": "For a woman as soon as she heard of him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, came in and fell down at his feet.",
    "Mark 7:26": "For the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophenician born. And she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.",
    "Mark 7:27": "Who said to her: Suffer first the children to be filled: for it is not good to take the bread of the children, and cast it to the dogs.",
    "Mark 7:28": "But she answered and said to him: Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat under the table of the crumbs of the children.",
    "Mark 7:29": "And he said to her: For this saying go thy way, the devil is gone out of thy daughter.",
    "Mark 7:30": "And when she was come into her house, she found the girl lying upon the bed, and that the devil was gone out.",
    "Mark 7:31": "And again going out of the coasts of Tyre, he came by Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.",
    "Mark 7:32": "And they bring to him one deaf and dumb; and they besought him that he would lay his hand upon him.",
    "Mark 7:33": "And taking him from the multitude apart, he put his fingers into his ears, and spitting, he touched his tongue:",
    "Mark 7:34": "And looking up to heaven, he groaned, and said to him: Ephpheta, which is, Be thou opened.",
    "Mark 7:35": "And immediately his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke right.",
    "Mark 7:36": "And he charged them that they should tell no man. But the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal did they publish it.",
    "Mark 7:37": "And so much the more did they wonder, saying: He hath done all things well; he hath made both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.",
    "Mark 8:1": "IN those days again, when there was a great multitude, and had nothing to eat; calling his disciples together, he saith to them:",
    "Mark 8:2": "I have compassion on the multitude, for behold they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat.",
    "Mark 8:3": "And if I shall send them away fasting to their home, they will faint in the way; for some of them came from afar off.",
    "Mark 8:4": "And his disciples answered him: From whence can any one fill them here with bread in the wilderness?",
    "Mark 8:5": "And he asked them: How many loaves have ye? Who said: Seven.",
    "Mark 8:6": "And taking the seven loaves, giving thanks, he broke, and gave to his disciples for to set before them; and they set them before the people.",
    "Mark 8:7": "And they had a few little fishes; and he blessed them, and commanded them to be set before them.",
    "Mark 8:8": "And they did eat and were filled; and they took up that which was left of the fragments, seven baskets.",
    "Mark 8:9": "And they that had eaten were about four thousand; and he sent them away.",
    "Mark 8:10": "And immediately going up into a ship with his disciples, he came into the parts of Dalmanutha.",
    "Mark 8:11": "And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, asking him a sign from heaven, tempting him.",
    "Mark 8:12": "And sighing deeply in spirit, he saith: Why doth this generation seek a sign? Amen, I say to you, a sign shall not be given to this generation.",
    "Mark 8:13": "And leaving them, he went up again into the ship, and passed to the other side of the water.",
    "Mark 8:14": "And they forgot to take bread; and they had but one loaf with them in the ship.",
    "Mark 8:15": "And he charged them, saying: Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.",
    "Mark 8:16": "And they reasoned among themselves, saying: Because we have no bread.",
    "Mark 8:17": "Which Jesus knowing, saith to them: Why do you reason, because you have no bread? do you not yet know nor understand? have you still your heart blinded?",
    "Mark 8:18": "Having eyes, see you not? and having ears, hear you not? neither do you remember.",
    "Mark 8:19": "When I broke the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took you up? They say to him, Twelve.",
    "Mark 8:20": "When also the seven loaves among four thousand, how many baskets of fragments took you up? And they say to him, Seven.",
    "Mark 8:21": "And he said to them: How do you not yet understand?",
    "Mark 8:22": "And they came to Bethsaida; and they bring to him a blind man, and they besought him that he would touch him.",
    "Mark 8:23": "And taking the blind man by the hand, he led him out of the town; and spitting upon his eyes, laying his hands on him, he asked him if he saw any thing.",
    "Mark 8:24": "And looking up, he said: I see men as it were trees, walking.",
    "Mark 8:25": "After that again he laid his hands upon his eyes, and he began to see, and was restored, so that he saw all things clearly.",
    "Mark 8:26": "And he sent him into his house, saying: Go into thy house, and if thou enter into the town, tell nobody.",
    "Mark 8:27": "And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi. And in the way, he asked his disciples, saying to them: Whom do men say that I am?",
    "Mark 8:28": "Who answered him, saying: John the Baptist; but some Elias, and others as one of the prophets.",
    "Mark 8:29": "Then he saith to them: But whom do you say that I am? Peter answering said to him: Thou art the Christ.",
    "Mark 8:30": "And he strictly charged them that they should not tell any man of him.",
    "Mark 8:31": "And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the ancients and by the high priests, and the scribes, and be killed: and after three days rise again.",
    "Mark 8:32": "And he spoke the word openly. And Peter taking him, began to rebuke him.",
    "Mark 8:33": "Who turning about and seeing his disciples, threatened Peter, saying: Go behind me, Satan, because thou savorest not the things that are of God, but that are of men.",
    "Mark 8:34": "And calling the multitude together with his disciples, he said to them: If any man will follow me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.",
    "Mark 8:35": "For whosoever will save his life, shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel, shall save it.",
    "Mark 8:36": "For what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and suffer the loss of his soul?",
    "Mark 8:37": "Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?",
    "Mark 8:38": "For he that shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, in this adulterous and sinful generation: the Son of man also will be ashamed of him, when he shall come in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.",
    "Mark 9:1": "And he said to them: Amen I say to you, that there are some of them that stand here, who shall not taste death, till they see the kingdom of God coming in power.",
    "Mark 9:2": "AND after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter and James and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves, and was transfigured before them.",
    "Mark 9:3": "And his garments became shining and exceeding white as snow, so as no fuller upon earth can make white.",
    "Mark 9:4": "And there appeared to them Elias with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus.",
    "Mark 9:5": "And Peter answering, said to Jesus: Rabbi, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.",
    "Mark 9:6": "For he knew not what he said: for they were struck with fear.",
    "Mark 9:7": "And there was a cloud overshadowing them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying: This is my most beloved son; hear ye him.",
    "Mark 9:8": "And immediately looking about, they saw no man any more, but Jesus only with them.",
    "Mark 9:9": "And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them not to tell any man what things they had seen, till the Son of man shall be risen again from the dead.",
    "Mark 9:10": "And they kept the word to themselves; questioning together what that should mean, when he shall be risen from the dead.",
    "Mark 9:11": "And they asked him, saying: Why then do the Pharisees and scribes say that Elias must come first?",
    "Mark 9:12": "Who answering, said to them: Elias, when he shall come first, shall restore all things; and as it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things and be despised.",
    "Mark 9:13": "But I say to you, that Elias also is come, (and they have done to him whatsoever they would,) as it is written of him.",
    "Mark 9:14": "And coming to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes disputing with them.",
    "Mark 9:15": "And presently all the people seeing Jesus, were astonished and struck with fear; and running to him, they saluted him.",
    "Mark 9:16": "And he asked them: What do you question about among you?",
    "Mark 9:17": "And one of the multitude, answering, said: Master, I have brought my son to thee, having a dumb spirit.",
    "Mark 9:18": "Who, wheresoever he taketh him, dasheth him, and he foameth, and gnasheth with the teeth, and pineth away; and I spoke to thy disciples to cast him out, and they could not.",
    "Mark 9:19": "Who answering them, said: O incredulous generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.",
    "Mark 9:20": "And they brought him. And when he had seen him, immediately the spirit troubled him; and being thrown down upon the ground, he rolled about foaming.",
    "Mark 9:21": "And he asked his father: How long time is it since this hath happened unto him? But he said: From his infancy:",
    "Mark 9:22": "And oftentimes hath he cast him into the fire and into waters to destroy him. But if thou canst do any thing, help us, having compassion on us.",
    "Mark 9:23": "And Jesus saith to him: If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.",
    "Mark 9:24": "And immediately the father of the boy crying out, with tears said: I do believe, Lord: help my unbelief.",
    "Mark 9:25": "And when Jesus saw the multitude running together, he threatened the unclean spirit, saying to him: Deaf and dumb spirit, I command thee, go out of him; and enter not any more into him.",
    "Mark 9:26": "And crying out, and greatly tearing him, he went out of him, and he became as dead, so that many said: He is dead.",
    "Mark 9:27": "But Jesus taking him by the hand, lifted him up; and he arose.",
    "Mark 9:28": "And when he was come into the house, his disciples secretly asked him: Why could not we cast him out?",
    "Mark 9:29": "And he said to them: This kind can go out by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.",
    "Mark 9:30": "And departing from thence, they passed through Galilee, and he would not that any man should know it.",
    "Mark 9:31": "And he taught his disciple, and said to them: The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise again the third day.",
    "Mark 9:32": "But they understood not the word, and they were afraid to ask him.",
    "Mark 9:33": "And they came to Capharnaum. And when they were in the house, he asked them: What did you treat of in the way?",
    "Mark 9:34": "But they held their peace, for in the way they had disputed among themselves, which of them should be the greatest.",
    "Mark 9:35": "And sitting down, he called the twelve, and saith to them: If any man desire to be first, he shall be the last of all, and the minister of all.",
    "Mark 9:36": "And taking a child, he set him in the midst of them. Whom when he had embraced, he saith to them:",
    "Mark 9:37": "Whosoever shall receive one such child as this in my name, receiveth me. And whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.",
    "Mark 9:38": "John answered him, saying: Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, who followeth not us, and we forbade him.",
    "Mark 9:39": "But Jesus said: Do not forbid him. For there is no man that doth a miracle in my name, and can soon speak ill of me.",
    "Mark 9:40": "For he that is not against you, is for you.",
    "Mark 9:41": "For whosoever shall give you to drink a cup of water in my name, because you belong to Christ: amen I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.",
    "Mark 9:42": "And whosoever shall scandalize one of these little ones that believe in me; it were better for him that a millstone were hanged around his neck, and he were cast into the sea.",
    "Mark 9:43": "And if thy hand scandalize thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life, maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into unquenchable fire:",
    "Mark 9:44": "Where there worm dieth not, and the fire is not extinguished.",
    "Mark 9:45": "And if thy foot scandalize thee, cut it off. It is better for thee to enter lame into life everlasting, than having two feet, to be cast into the hell of unquenchable fire:",
    "Mark 9:46": "Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not extinguished.",
    "Mark 9:47": "And if thy eye scandalize thee, pluck it out. It is better for thee with one eye to enter into the kingdom of God, than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire:",
    "Mark 9:48": "Where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not extinguished.",
    "Mark 9:49": "For every one shall be salted with fire: and every victim shall be salted with salt.",
    "Mark 9:50": "Salt is good. But if the salt became unsavory; wherewith will you season it? Have salt in you, and have peace among you.",

    "Mark 10:2": "And the Pharisees coming to him asked him: Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.",
    "Mark 10:3": "But he answering, saith to them: What did Moses command you?",
    "Mark 10:4": "Who said: Moses permitted to write a bill of divorce, and to put her away.",
    "Mark 10:5": "To whom Jesus answering, said: Because of the hardness of your heart he wrote you that precept.",
    "Mark 10:6": "But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.",
    "Mark 10:7": "For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother; and shall cleave to his wife.",

    "Mark 10:18": "And Jesus said to him, Why callest thou me good? None is good but one, that is God.",
    "Mark 10:19": "Thou knowest the commandments: Do not commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, bear not false witness, do no fraud, honour thy father and mother.",
    "Mark 10:20": "But he answering, said to him: Master, all these things I have observed from my youth.",
    "Mark 10:21": "And Jesus looking on him, loved him, and said to him: One thing is wanting unto thee: go, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.",
    "Mark 10:22": "Who being struck sad at that saying, went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.",
    "Mark 10:23": "And Jesus looking round about, saith to his disciples: How hardly shall they that have riches, enter into the kingdom of God!",
    "Mark 10:24": "And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus again answering, saith to them: Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches, to enter into the kingdom of God?",

    "Mark 12:17": "And Jesus answering, said to them: Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesarâ€™s, and to God the things that are Godâ€™s. And they marvelled at him.",
    "Mark 12:18": "And there came to him the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying:",
    "Mark 12:19": "Master, Moses wrote unto us, that if any manâ€™s brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.",
    "Mark 12:20": "Now there were seven brethren; and the first took a wife, and died leaving no issue.",

    "Mark 13:18": "But pray ye, that these things happen not in winter.",
    "Mark 13:19": "For in those days shall be such tribulations, as were not from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, neither shall be.",
    "Mark 13:20": "And unless the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh should be saved: but for the sake of the elect which he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.",
    "Mark 13:21": "And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; lo, he is here: do not believe.",
    "Mark 13:22": "For there will rise up false Christs and false prophets, and they shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce (if it were possible) even the elect.",

    "Mark 14:20": "Who saith to them: One of the twelve, who dippeth with me his hand in the dish.",
    "Mark 14:21": "And the Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed. It were better for him, if that man had not been born.",

    "Luke 8:30": "And Jesus asked him, saying: What is thy name? But he said: Legion; because many devils were entered into him.",
    "Luke 8:31": "And they besought him that he would not command them to go into the abyss.",
    "Luke 8:32": "And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain; and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.",

    "Luke 11:40": "Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without, make also that which is within?",
    "Luke 11:41": "But yet that which remaineth, give alms; and behold, all things are clean unto you.",
    "Luke 11:42": "But woe to you, Pharisees, because you tithe mint and rue and every herb; and pass over judgment, and the charity of God. Now these things you ought to have done, and not to leave the other undone.",
    "Luke 11:43": "Woe to you, Pharisees, because you love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and salutations in the marketplace.",

    "Luke 14:30": "Saying: This man began to build, and was not able to finish.",
    "Luke 14:31": "Or what king, about to go to make war against another king, doth not first sit down, and think whether he be able, with ten thousand, to meet him that, with twenty thousand, cometh against him?",
    "Luke 14:32": "Or else, whilst the other is yet afar off, sending an embassy, he desireth conditions of peace.",

    "Luke 15:5": "And when he hath found it, lay it upon his shoulders, rejoicing:",
    "Luke 15:6": "And coming home, call together his friends and neighbours, saying to them: Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost?",
    "Luke 15:7": "I say to you, that even so there shall be joy in heaven upon one sinner that doth penance, more than upon ninety-nine just who need not penance.",
    "Luke 15:8": "Or what woman having ten groats; if she lose one groat, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently until she find it?",
    "Luke 15:9": "And when she hath found it, call together her friends and neighbours, saying: Rejoice with me, because I have found the groat which I had lost.",

    "Luke 15:29": "And he answering, said to his father: Behold, for so many years do I serve thee, and I have never transgressed thy commandment, and yet thou hast never given me a kid to make merry with my friends:",
    "Luke 15:30": "But as soon as this thy son is come, who hath devoured his substance with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.",
    "Luke 15:31": "But he said to him: Son, thou art always with me, and all I have is thine.",
    "Luke 15:32": "But it was fit that we should make merry and be glad, for this thy brother was dead and is come to life again; he was lost, and is found.",

    "Luke 16:15": "And he said to them: You are they who justify yourselves before men, but God knoweth your hearts; for that which is high to men, is an abomination before God.",
    "Luke 16:16": "The law and the prophets were until John; from that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every one useth violence towards it.",
    "Luke 16:17": "And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fall.",
    "Luke 16:18": "Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth her that is put away from her husband, commmitteth adultery.",

    "Luke 16:24": "And he cried, and said: Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, to cool my tongue: for I am tormented in this flame.",
    "Luke 16:25": "And Abraham said to him: Son, remember that thou didst receive good things in thy lifetime, and likewise Lazareth evil things, but now he is comforted; and thou art tormented.",
    "Luke 16:26": "And besides all this, between us and you, there is fixed a great chaos: so that they who would pass from hence to you, cannot, nor from thence come hither.",
    "Luke 16:27": "And he said: Then, father, I beseech thee, that thou wouldst send him to my fatherâ€™s house, for I have five brethren,",
    "Luke 16:28": "That he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torments.",
    "Luke 16:29": "And Abraham said to him: They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.",
    "Luke 16:30": "But he said: No, father Abraham: but if one went to them from the dead, they will do penance.",
    "Luke 16:31": "And he said to him: If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they believe, if one rise again from the dead.",
    "Luke 17:1": "AND he said to his disciples: It is impossible that scandals should not come: but woe to him through whom they come.",
    "Luke 17:2": "It were better for him, that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should scandalize one of these little ones.",
    "Luke 17:3": "Take heed to yourselves. If thy brother sin against thee, reprove him: and if he do penance, forgive him.",
    "Luke 17:4": "And if he sin against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day be converted unto thee, saying, I repent; forgive him.",

    "Luke 17:9": "Doth he thank that servant, for doing the things which he commanded him?",
    "Luke 17:10": "I think not. So you also, when you shall have done all these things that are commanded you, say: We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which we ought to do.",
    "Luke 17:11": "And it came to pass, as he was going to Jerusalem, he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.",
    "Luke 17:12": "And as he entered into a certain town, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off;",
    "Luke 17:13": "And lifted up their voice, saying: Jesus, master, have mercy on us.",
    "Luke 17:14": "Whom when he saw, he said: Go, shew yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, as they went, they were made clean.",

    "Luke 17:22": "And he said to his disciples: The days will come, when you shall desire to see one day of the Son of man; and you shall not see it.",
    "Luke 17:23": "And they will say to you: See here, and see there. Go ye not after, nor follow them:",
    "Luke 17:24": "For as the lightening that lighteneth from under heaven, shineth unto the parts that are under heaven, so shall the Son of man be in his day.",
    "Luke 17:25": "But first he must suffer many things, and be rejected by this generation.",
    "Luke 17:26": "And as it came to pass in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.",
    "Luke 17:27": "They did eat and drink, they married wives, and were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark: and the flood came and destroyed them all.",

    "Luke 17:29": "And in the day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.",
    "Luke 17:30": "Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man shall be revealed.",
    "Luke 17:31": "In that hour, he that shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and he that shall be in the field, in like manner, let him not return back.",
    "Luke 17:32": "Remember Lotâ€™s wife.",

    "Luke 18:3": "And there was a certain widow in that city, and she came to him, saying: Avenge me of my adversary.",
    "Luke 18:4": "And he would not for a long time. But afterwards he said within himself: Although I fear not God, nor regard man,",
    "Luke 18:5": "Yet because this widow is troublesome to me, I will avenge her, lest continually coming she weary me.",
    "Luke 18:6": "And the Lord said: Hear what the unjust judge saith.",
    "Luke 18:7": "And will not God revenge his elect who cry to him day and night: and will he have patience in their regard?",
    "Luke 18:8": "I say to you, that he will quickly revenge them. But yet the Son of man, when he cometh, shall he find, think you, faith on earth?",
    "Luke 18:9": "And to some who trusted in themselves as just, and despised others, he spoke also this parable:",
    "Luke 18:10": "Two men went up into the temple to pray: the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.",
    "Luke 18:11": "The Pharisee standing, prayed thus with himself: O God, I give thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, as also is this publican.",
    "Luke 18:12": "I fast twice in a week: I give tithes of all that I possess.",
    "Luke 18:13": "And the publican, standing afar off, would not so much as lift up his eyes towards heaven; but struck his breast, saying: O god, be merciful to me a sinner.",
    "Luke 18:14": "I say to you, this man went down into his house justified rather that the other: because every one that exalteth himself, shall be humbled: and he that humbleth himself, shall be exalted.",
    "Luke 18:15": "And they brought unto him also infants, that he might touch them. Which when the disciples saw, they rebuked them.",
    "Luke 18:16": "But Jesus, calling them together, said: Suffer children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.",

    "Luke 18:21": "Who said: All these things have I kept from my youth.",
    "Luke 18:22": "Which when Jesus had heard, he said to him: Yet one thing is wanting to thee: sell all whatever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.",
    "Luke 18:23": "He having heard these things, became sorrowful; for he was very rich.",
    "Luke 18:24": "And Jesus seeing him become sorrowful, said: How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God.",

    "Luke 19:5": "And when Jesus was come to the place, looking up, he saw him, and said to him: Zacheus, make haste and come down; for this day I must abide in thy house.",
    "Luke 19:6": "And he made haste and came down; and received him with joy.",
    "Luke 19:7": "And when all saw it, they murmured, saying, that he was gone to be a guest with a man that was a sinner.",
    "Luke 19:8": "But Zacheus standing, said to the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have wronged any man of any thing, I restore him fourfold.",
    "Luke 19:9": "Jesus said to him: This day is salvation come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.",
    "Luke 19:10": "For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.",

    "Luke 20:4": "The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?",
    "Luke 20:5": "But they thought within themselves, saying: If we shall say, From heaven: he will say: Why then did you not believe him?",
    "Luke 20:6": "But if we say, Of men, the whole people will stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.",
    "Luke 20:7": "And they answered, that they knew not whence it was.",

    "John 3:14": "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of man be lifted up:",
    "John 3:15": "That whosoever believeth in him, may not perish; but may have life everlasting.",
    "John 3:16": "For God so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son; that whosoever believeth in him, may not perish, but may have life everlasting.",
    "John 3:17": "For God sent not his Son into the world, to judge the world, but that the world may be saved by him.",
    "John 3:18": "He that believeth in him is not judged. But he that doth not believe, is already judged: because he believeth not in the name of the only begotten Son of God.",
    "John 3:19": "And this is the judgment: because the light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than the light: for their works were evil.",
    "John 3:20": "For every one that doth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, that his works may not be reproved.",

    "John 3:26": "And they came to John, and said to him: Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou gavest testimony, behold he baptizeth, and all men come to him.",
    "John 3:27": "John answered, and said: A man cannot receive any thing, unless it be given him from heaven.",
    "John 3:28": "You yourselves do bear me witness, that I said, I am not Christ, but that I am sent before him.",
    "John 3:29": "He that hath the bride, is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth with joy because of the bridegroomâ€™s voice. This my joy therefore is fulfilled.",
    "John 3:30": "He must increase, but I must decrease.",
    "John 3:31": "He that cometh from above, is above all. He that is of the earth, of the earth he is, and of the earth he speaketh. He that cometh from heaven, is above all.",
    "John 3:32": "And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth: and no man receiveth his testimony.",
    "John 3:33": "He that hath received his testimony, hath set to his seal that God is true.",
    "John 3:34": "For he whom God hath sent, speaketh the words of God: for God doth not give the Spirit by measure.",
    "John 3:35": "The Father loveth the Son: and he hath given all things into his hand.",
    "John 3:36": "He that believeth in the Son, hath life everlasting; but he that believeth not the Son, shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.",
    "John 4:1": "WHEN Jesus therefore understood that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus maketh more disciples, and baptizeth more than John,",
    "John 4:2": "(Though Jesus himself did not baptize, but his disciples,)",
    "John 4:3": "He left Judea, and went again into Galilee.",
    "John 4:4": "And he was of necessity to pass through Samaria.",
    "John 4:5": "He cometh therefore to a city of Samaria, which is called Sichar, near the land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.",
    "John 4:6": "Now Jacobâ€™s well was there. Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well. It was about the sixth hour.",
    "John 4:7": "There cometh a woman of Samaria, to draw water. Jesus saith to her: Give me to drink.",
    "John 4:8": "For his disciples were gone into the city to buy meats.",
    "John 4:9": "Then that Samaritan woman saith to him: How dost thou, being a Jew, ask of me to drink, who am a Samaritan woman? For the Jews do not communicate with the Samaritans.",
    "John 4:10": "Jesus answered, and said to her: If thou didst know the gift of God, and who he is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou perhaps wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.",
    "John 4:11": "The woman saith to him: Sir, thou hast nothing wherein to draw, and the well is deep; from whence then hast thou living water?",
    "John 4:12": "Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?",
    "John 4:13": "Jesus answered, and said to her: Whosoever drinketh of this water, shall thirst again; but he that shall drink of the water that I will give him, shall not thirst for ever:",
    "John 4:14": "But the water that I will give him, shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into life everlasting.",
    "John 4:15": "The woman saith to him: Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.",
    "John 4:16": "Jesus saith to her: Go, call thy husband, and come hither.",
    "John 4:17": "The woman answered, and said: I have no husband. Jesus said to her: Thou hast said well, I have no husband:",
    "John 4:18": "For thou hast had five husbands: and he whom thou now hast, is not thy husband. This thou hast said truly.",
    "John 4:19": "The woman saith to him: Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.",
    "John 4:20": "Our fathers adored on this mountain, and you say, that at Jerusalem is the place where men must adore.",
    "John 4:21": "Jesus saith to her: Woman, believe me, that the hour cometh, when you shall neither on this mountain, not in Jerusalem, adore the Father.",
    "John 4:22": "You adore that which you know not: we adore that which we know; for salvation is of the Jews.",
    "John 4:23": "But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true adorers shall adore the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father also seeketh such to adore him.",
    "John 4:24": "God is a spirit; and they that adore him, must adore him in spirit and in truth.",
    "John 4:25": "The woman saith to him: I know that the Messias cometh (who is called Christ); therefore, when he is come, he will tell us all things.",
    "John 4:26": "Jesus saith to her: I am he, who am speaking with thee.",
    "John 4:27": "And immediately his disciples came; and they wondered that he talked with the woman. Yet no man said: What seekest thou? or, why talkest thou with her?",
    "John 4:28": "The woman therefore left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men there:",
    "John 4:29": "Come, and see a man who has told me all things whatsoever I have done. Is not he the Christ?",
    "John 4:30": "They went therefore out of the city, and came unto him.",
    "John 4:31": "In the mean time the disciples prayed him, saying: Rabbi, eat.",
    "John 4:32": "But he said to them: I have meat to eat, which you know not.",
    "John 4:33": "The disciples therefore said one to another: Hath any man brought him to eat?",
    "John 4:34": "Jesus saith to them: My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, that I may perfect his work.",
    "John 4:35": "Do you not say, There are yet four months, and then the harvest cometh? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes, and see the countries; for they are white already to harvest.",
    "John 4:36": "And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life everlasting: that both he that soweth, and he that reapeth, may rejoice together.",
    "John 4:37": "For in this is the saying true: That it is one man that soweth, and it is another that reapeth.",
    "John 4:38": "I have sent you to reap that in which you did not labour: others have laboured, and you have entered into their labours.",
    "John 4:39": "Now of that city many of the Samaritans believed in him, for the word of the woman giving testimony: He told me all things whatsoever I have done.",
    "John 4:40": "So when the Samaritans were come to him, they desired that he would tarry there. And he abode there two days.",
    "John 4:41": "And many more believed in him because of his own word.",
    "John 4:42": "And they said to the woman: We now believe, not for thy saying: for we ourselves have heard him, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.",
    "John 4:43": "Now after two days, he departed thence, and went into Galilee.",
    "John 4:44": "For Jesus himself gave testimony that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.",
    "John 4:45": "And when he was come into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things he had done at Jerusalem on the festival day; for they also went to the festival day.",
    "John 4:46": "He came again therefore into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain ruler, whose son was sick at Capharnaum.",
    "John 4:47": "He having heard that Jesus was come from Judea into Galilee, went to him, and prayed him to come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.",
    "John 4:48": "Jesus therefore said to him: Unless you see signs and wonders, you believe not.",
    "John 4:49": "The ruler saith to him: Lord, come down before that my son die.",
    "John 4:50": "Jesus saith to him: Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and went his way.",
    "John 4:51": "And as he was going down, his servants met him; and they brought word, saying, that his son lived.",
    "John 4:52": "He asked therefore of them the hour wherein he grew better. And they said to him: Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him.",
    "John 4:53": "The father therefore knew, that it was at the same hour that Jesus said to him, Thy son liveth; and himself believed, and his whole house.",
    "John 4:54": "This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judea into Galilee.",
    "John 5:1": "AFTER these things was a festival day of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.",
    "John 5:2": "Now there is at Jerusalem a pond, called Probatica, which in Hebrew is named Bethsaida, having five porches.",
    "John 5:3": "In these lay a great multitude of sick, of blind, of lame, of withered; waiting for the moving of the water.",
    "John 5:4": "And an angel of the Lord descended at certain times into the pond; and the water was moved. And he that went down first into the pond after the motion of the water, was made whole, of whatsoever infirmity he lay under.",
    "John 5:5": "And there was a certain man there, that had been eight and thirty years under his infirmity.",
    "John 5:6": "Him when Jesus had seen lying, and knew that he had been now a long time, he saith to him: Wilt thou be made whole?",
    "John 5:7": "The infirm man answered him: Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pond. For whilst I am coming, another goeth down before me.",
    "John 5:8": "Jesus saith to him: Arise, take up thy bed, and walk.",
    "John 5:9": "And immediately the man was made whole: and he took up his bed, and walked. And it was the sabbath that day.",
    "John 5:10": "The Jews therefore said to him that was healed: It is the sabbath; it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.",
    "John 5:11": "He answered them: He that made me whole, he said to me, Take up thy bed, and walk.",
    "John 5:12": "They asked him therefore: Who is that man who said to thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?",
    "John 5:13": "But he who was healed, knew not who it was; for Jesus went aside from the multitude standing in the place.",
    "John 5:14": "Afterwards, Jesus findeth him in the temple, and saith to him: Behold thou art made whole: sin no more, lest some worse thing happen to thee.",
    "John 5:15": "The man went his way, and told the Jews, that it was Jesus who had made him whole.",
    "John 5:16": "Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.",
    "John 5:17": "But Jesus answered them: My Father worketh until now; and I work.",
    "John 5:18": "Hereupon therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he did not only break the sabbath, but also said God was his Father, making himself equal to God.",
    "John 5:19": "Then Jesus answered, and said to them: Amen, amen, I say unto you, the Son cannot do any thing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing: for what things soever he doth, these the Son also doth in like manner.",
    "John 5:20": "For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things which himself doth: and greater works than these will he shew him, that you may wonder.",
    "John 5:21": "For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and giveth life: so the Son also giveth life to whom he will.",
    "John 5:22": "For neither doth the Father judge any man, but hath given all judgment to the Son.",
    "John 5:23": "That all men may honour the Son, as they honour the Father. He who honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father, who hath sent him.",
    "John 5:24": "Amen, amen I say unto you, that he who heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath life everlasting; and cometh not into judgment, but is passed from death to life.",
    "John 5:25": "Amen, amen I say unto you, that the hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.",
    "John 5:26": "For as the Father hath life in himself, so he hath given the Son also to have life in himself:",
    "John 5:27": "And he hath given him power to do judgment, because he is the Son of man.",
    "John 5:28": "Wonder not at this; for the hour cometh, wherein all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God.",
    "John 5:29": "And they that have done good things, shall come forth unto the resurrection of life; but they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.",
    "John 5:30": "I cannot of myself do any thing. As I hear, so I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of him that sent me.",
    "John 5:31": "If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.",
    "John 5:32": "There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.",
    "John 5:33": "You sent to John, and he gave testimony to the truth.",
    "John 5:34": "But I receive not testimony from man: but I say these things, that you may be saved.",

    "John 9:13": "They bring him that had been blind to the Pharisees.",
    "John 9:14": "Now it was the sabbath, when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.",
    "John 9:15": "Again therefore the Pharisees asked him, how he had received his sight. But he said to them: He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and I see.",
    "John 9:16": "Some therefore of the Pharisees said: This man is not of God, who keepeth not the sabbath. But others said: How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.",
    "John 9:17": "They say therefore to the blind man again: What sayest thou of him that hath opened they eyes? And he said: He is a prophet.",
    "John 9:18": "The Jews then did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,",
    "John 9:19": "And asked them, saying: Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then doth he now see?",
    "John 9:20": "His parents answered them, and said: We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:",
    "John 9:21": "But how he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: ask himself: he is of age, let him speak for himself.",
    "John 9:22": "These things his parents said, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had already agreed among themselves, that if any man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.",
    "John 9:23": "Therefore did his parents say: He is of age, ask himself.",
    "John 9:24": "They therefore called the man again that had been blind, and said to him: Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.",
    "John 9:25": "He said therefore to them: If he be a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see.",
    "John 9:26": "They said then to him: What did he to thee? How did he open thy eyes?",
    "John 9:27": "He answered them: I have told you already, and you have heard: why would you hear it again? will you also become his disciples?",
    "John 9:28": "They reviled him therefore, and said: Be thou his disciple; but we are the disciples of Moses.",
    "John 9:29": "We know that God spoke to Moses: but as to this man, we know not from whence he is.",
    "John 9:30": "The man answered, and said to them: Why, herein is a wonderful thing, that you know not from whence he is, and he hath opened my eyes.",
    "John 9:31": "Now we know that God doth not hear sinners: but if a man be a server of God, and doth his will, him he heareth.",
    "John 9:32": "From the beginning of the world it hath not been heard, that any man hath opened the eyes of one born blind.",
    "John 9:33": "Unless this man were of God, he could not do any thing.",
    "John 9:34": "They answered, and said to him: Thou wast wholly born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.",
    "John 9:35": "Jesus heard that they had cast him out: and when he had found him, he said to him: Dost thou believe in the Son of God?",
    "John 9:36": "He answered, and said: Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?",
    "John 9:37": "And Jesus said to him: Thou hast both seen him; and it is he that talketh with thee.",
    "John 9:38": "And he said: I believe, Lord. And falling down, he adored him.",
    "John 9:39": "And Jesus said: For judgment I am come into this world; that they who see not, may see; and they who see, may become blind.",
    "John 9:40": "And some of the Pharisees, who were with him, heard: and they said unto him: Are we also blind?",
    "John 9:41": "Jesus said to them: If you were blind, you should not have sin: but now you say: We see. Your sin remaineth.",
    "John 10:1": "AMEN, amen I say to you: He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up another way, the same is a thief and a robber.",
    "John 10:2": "But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.",
    "John 10:3": "To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.",
    "John 10:4": "And when he hath let out his own sheep, he goeth before them: and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.",
    "John 10:5": "But a stranger they follow not, but fly from him, because they know not the voice of strangers.",
    "John 10:6": "This proverb Jesus spoke to them. But they understood not what he spoke to them.",
    "John 10:7": "Jesus therefore said to them again: Amen, amen I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.",
    "John 10:8": "All others, as many as have come, are thieves and robbers: and the sheep heard them not.",
    "John 10:9": "I am the door. By me, if any man enter in, he shall be saved: and he shall go in, and go out, and shall find pastures.",
    "John 10:10": "The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I am come that they may have life, and may have it more abundantly.",
    "John 10:11": "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd giveth his life for his sheep.",
    "John 10:12": "But the hireling, and he that is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and flieth: and the wolf catcheth, and scattereth the sheep:",
    "John 10:13": "And the hireling flieth, because he is a hireling: and he hath no care for the sheep.",
    "John 10:14": "I am the good shepherd; and I know mine, and mine know me.",
    "John 10:15": "As the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father: and I lay down my life for my sheep.",
    "John 10:16": "And other sheep I have, that are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice, and there shall be one fold and one shepherd.",
    "John 10:17": "Therefore doth the Father love me: because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.",
    "John 10:18": "No man taketh it away from me: but I lay it down of myself, and I have power to lay it down: and I have power to take it up again. This commandment have I received of my Father.",
    "John 10:19": "A dissension rose again among the Jews for these words.",
    "John 10:20": "And many of them said: He hath a devil, and is mad: why hear you him?",
    "John 10:21": "Others said: These are not the words of one that hath a devil: Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?",
    "John 10:22": "And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem: and it was winter.",
    "John 10:23": "And Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomonâ€™s porch.",
    "John 10:24": "The Jews therefore came round about him, and said to him: How long dost thou hold our souls in suspense? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.",
    "John 10:25": "Jesus answered them: I speak to you, and you believe not: the works that I do in the name of my Father, they give testimony of me.",
    "John 10:26": "But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep.",
    "John 10:27": "My sheep hear my voice: and I know them, and they follow me.",
    "John 10:28": "And I give them life everlasting; and they shall not perish for ever, and no man shall pluck them out of my hand.",
    "John 10:29": "That which my Father hath given me, is greater than all: and no one can snatch them out of the hand of my Father.",
    "John 10:30": "I and the Father are one.",
    "John 10:31": "The Jews then took up stones to stone him.",
    "John 10:32": "Jesus answered them: Many good works I have shewed you from my Father; for which of these works do you stone me?",
    "John 10:33": "The Jews answered him: For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, maketh thyself God.",
    "John 10:34": "Jesus answered them: Is it not written in your law: I said you are gods?",
    "John 10:35": "If he called them gods, to whom to word of God was spoken, and the scripture cannot be broken;",
    "John 10:36": "Do you say of him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world: Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God?",
    "John 10:37": "If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.",
    "John 10:38": "But if I do, though you will not believe me, believe the works: that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.",
    "John 10:39": "They sought therefore to take him; and he escaped out of their hands.",
    "John 10:40": "And he went again beyond the Jordan, into that place where John was baptizing first; and there he abode.",
    "John 10:41": "And many resorted to him, and they said: John indeed did no sign.",
    "John 10:42": "But all things whatsoever John said of this man, were true. And many believed in him.",
    "John 11:1": "NOW there was a certain man sick, named Lazarus, of Bethania, of the town of Mary and Martha her sister.",
    "John 11:2": "(And Mary was she that anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair: whose brother Lazarus was sick.)",
    "John 11:3": "His sisters therefore sent to him, saying: Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.",
    "John 11:4": "And Jesus hearing it, said to them: This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God: that the Son of God may be glorified by it.",
    "John 11:5": "Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister Mary, and Lazarus.",
    "John 11:6": "When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he still remained in the same place two days.",
    "John 11:7": "Then after that, he said to his disciples: Let us go into Judea again.",
    "John 11:8": "The disciples say to him: Rabbi, the Jews but now sought to stone thee: and goest thou thither again?",
    "John 11:9": "Jesus answered: Are there not twelve hours of the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world:",
    "John 11:10": "But if he walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.",
    "John 11:11": "These things he said; and after that he said to them: Lazarus our friend sleepeth; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.",
    "John 11:12": "His disciples therefore said: Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.",
    "John 11:13": "But Jesus spoke of his death; and they thought that he spoke of the repose of sleep.",
    "John 11:14": "Then therefore Jesus said to them plainly: Lazarus is dead.",
    "John 11:15": "And I am glad, for your sakes, that I was not there, that you may believe: but let us go to him.",
    "John 11:16": "Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples: Let us also go, that we may die with him.",
    "John 11:17": "Jesus therefore came, and found that he had been four days already in the grave.",
    "John 11:18": "(Now Bethania was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off.)",
    "John 11:19": "And many of the Jews were come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.",
    "John 11:20": "Martha therefore, as soon as she heard that Jesus had come, went to meet him: but Mary sat at home.",
    "John 11:21": "Martha therefore said to Jesus: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.",
    "John 11:22": "But now also I know that whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.",
    "John 11:23": "Jesus saith to her: Thy brother shall rise again.",
    "John 11:24": "Martha saith to him: I know that he shall rise again, in the resurrection at the last day.",
    "John 11:25": "Jesus said to her: I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, although he be dead, shall live:",
    "John 11:26": "And every one that liveth, and believeth in me, shall not die for ever. Believest thou this?",
    "John 11:27": "She saith to him: Yea, Lord, I have believed that thou art Christ the Son of the living God, who art come into this world.",
    "John 11:28": "And when she had said these things, she went, and called her sister Mary secretly, saying: The master is come, and calleth for thee.",
    "John 11:29": "She, as soon as she heard this, riseth quickly, and cometh to him.",
    "John 11:30": "For Jesus was not yet come into the town: but he was still in that place where Martha had met him.",
    "John 11:31": "The Jews therefore, who were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary that she rose up speedily and went out, followed her, saying: She goeth to the grave to weep there.",
    "John 11:32": "When Mary therefore was come where Jesus was, seeing him, she fell down at his feet, and saith to him: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.",
    "John 11:33": "Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews that were come with her, weeping, groaned in the spirit, and troubled himself,",
    "John 11:34": "And said: Where have you laid him? They say to him: Lord, come and see.",
    "John 11:35": "And Jesus wept.",
    "John 11:36": "The Jews therefore said: Behold how he loved him.",

    "John 11:39": "Jesus saith: Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith to him: Lord, by this time he stinketh, for he is now of four days.",
    "John 11:40": "Jesus saith to her: Did not I say to thee, that if thou believe, thou shalt see the glory of God?",
    "John 11:41": "They took therefore the stone away. And Jesus lifting up his eyes said: Father, I give thee thanks that thou hast heard me.",
    "John 11:42": "And I knew that thou hearest me always; but because of the people who stand about have I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.",
    "John 11:43": "When he had said these things, he cried with a loud voice: Lazarus, come forth.",
    "John 11:44": "And presently he that had been dead came forth, bound feet and hands with winding bands; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus said to them: Loose him, and let him go.",
    "John 11:45": "Many therefore of the Jews, who were come to Mary and Martha, and had seen the things that Jesus did, believed in him.",
    "John 11:46": "But some of them went to the Pharisees, and told them the things that Jesus had done.",
    "John 11:47": "The chief priests therefore, and the Pharisees, gathered a council, and said: What do we, for this man doth many miracles?",
    "John 11:48": "If we let him alone so, all will believe in him; and the Romans will come, and take away our place and nation.",
    "John 11:49": "But one of them, named Caiphas, being the high priest that year, said to them: You know nothing.",
    "John 11:50": "Neither do you consider that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.",
    "John 11:51": "And this he spoke not of himself: but being the high priest of that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation.",
    "John 11:52": "And not only for the nation, but to gather together in one the children of God, that were dispersed.",
    "John 11:53": "From that day therefore they devised to put him to death.",
    "John 11:54": "Wherefore Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews; but he went into a country near the desert, unto a city that is called Ephrem, and there he abode with his disciples.",
    "John 11:55": "And the pasch of the Jews was at hand; and many from the country went up to Jerusalem, before the pasch to purify themselves.",
    "John 11:56": "They sought therefore for Jesus; and they discoursed one with another, standing in the temple: What think you that he is not come to the festival day?",
    "John 11:57": "And the chief priests and Pharisees had given a commandment, that if any man knew where he was, he should tell, that they might apprehend him.",
    "John 12:1": "JESUS therefore, six days before the pasch, came to Bethania, where Lazarus had been dead, whom Jesus raised to life.",
    "John 12:2": "And they made him a supper there: and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that were at table with him.",
    "John 12:3": "Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of right spikenard, of great price, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.",
    "John 12:4": "Then one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, he that was about to betray him, said:",
    "John 12:5": "Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?",
    "John 12:6": "Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the purse, carried the things that were put therein.",
    "John 12:7": "Jesus therefore said: Let her alone, that she may keep it against the day of my burial.",
    "John 12:8": "For the poor you have always with you; but me you have not always.",
    "John 12:9": "A great multitude therefore of the Jews knew that he was there; and they came, not for Jesusâ€™ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.",
    "John 12:10": "But the chief priests thought to kill Lazarus also:",
    "John 12:11": "Because many of the Jews, by reason of him, went away, and believed in Jesus.",
    "John 12:12": "And on the next day, a great multitude that was to come to the festival day, when they had heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,",
    "John 12:13": "Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried: Hosanna, blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, the king of Israel.",
    "John 12:14": "And Jesus found a young ass, and sat upon it, as it is written:",
    "John 12:15": "Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy king cometh, sitting on an assâ€™s colt.",
    "John 12:16": "These things his disciples did not know at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him.",
    "John 12:17": "The multitude therefore gave testimony, which was with him, when he called Lazarus out of the grave, and raised him from the dead.",
    "John 12:18": "For which reason also the people came to meet him, because they heard that he had done this miracle.",
    "John 12:19": "The Pharisees therefore said among themselves: Do you see that we prevail nothing? behold, the whole world is gone after him.",
    "John 12:20": "Now there were certain Gentiles among them, who came up to adore on the festival day.",
    "John 12:21": "These therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying: Sir, we would see Jesus.",
    "John 12:22": "Philip cometh, and telleth Andrew. Again Andrew and Philip told Jesus.",
    "John 12:23": "But Jesus answered them, saying: The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.",
    "John 12:24": "Amen, amen I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground die,",
    "John 12:25": "Itself remaineth alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world, keepeth it unto life eternal.",
    "John 12:26": "If any man minister to me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall my minister be. If any man minister to me, him will my Father honour.",
    "John 12:27": "Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause I came unto this hour.",
    "John 12:28": "Father, glorify thy name. A voice therefore came from heaven: I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.",
    "John 12:29": "The multitude therefore that stood and heard, said that it thundered. Others said: An angel spoke to him.",
    "John 12:30": "Jesus answered, and said: This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.",
    "John 12:31": "Now is the judgment of the world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.",
    "John 12:32": "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all things to myself.",
    "John 12:33": "(Now this he said, signifying what death he should die.)",
    "John 12:34": "The multitude answered him: We have heard out of the law, that Christ abideth for ever; and how sayest thou: The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?",
    "John 12:35": "Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a little while, the light is among you. Walk whilst you have the light, that the darkness overtake you not. And he that walketh in darkness, knoweth not whither he goeth.",
    "John 12:36": "Whilst you have the light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light. These things Jesus spoke; and he went away, and hid himself from them.",
    "John 12:37": "And whereas he had done so many miracles before them, they believed not in him:",
    "John 12:38": "That the saying of Isaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he said: Lord, who hath believed our hearing? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?",
    "John 12:39": "Therefore they could not believe, because Isaias said again:",
    "John 12:40": "He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.",
    "John 12:41": "These things said Isaias, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.",
    "John 12:42": "However, many of the chief men also believed in him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, that they might not be cast out of the synagogue.",
    "John 12:43": "For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.",
    "John 12:44": "But Jesus cried, and said: He that believeth in me, doth not believe in me, but in him that sent me.",
    "John 12:45": "And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.",
    "John 12:46": "I am come a light into the world; that whosoever believeth in me, may not remain in darkness.",
    "John 12:47": "And if any man hear my words, and keep them not, I do not judge him: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.",
    "John 12:48": "He that despiseth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him; the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.",
    "John 12:49": "For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father who sent me, he gave me commandment what I should say, and what I should speak.",
    "John 12:50": "And I know that his commandment is life everlasting. The things therefore that I speak, even as the Father said unto me, so do I speak.",
    "John 13:1": "BEFORE the festival day of the pasch, Jesus knowing that his hour was come, that he should pass out of this world to the Father: having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them unto the end.",
    "John 13:2": "And when supper was done, (the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray him,)",
    "John 13:3": "Knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he came from God, and goeth to God;",
    "John 13:4": "He riseth from supper, and layeth aside his garments, and having taken a towel, girded himself.",

    "John 13:9": "Simon Peter saith to him: Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head.",
    "John 13:10": "Jesus saith to him: He that is washed, needeth not but to wash his feet, but is clean wholly. And you are clean, but not all.",
    "John 13:11": "For he knew who he was that would betray him; therefore he said: You are not all clean.",
    "John 13:12": "Then after he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, being set down again, he said to them: Know you what I have done to you?",
    "John 13:13": "You call me Master, and Lord; and you say well, for so I am.",
    "John 13:14": "If then I being your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; you also ought to wash one anotherâ€™s feet.",
    "John 13:15": "For I have given you an example, that as I have done to you, so you do also.",
    "John 13:16": "Amen, amen I say to you: The servant is not greater than his lord; neither is the apostle greater than he that sent him.",

    "John 13:22": "The disciples therefore looked one upon another, doubting of whom he spoke.",
    "John 13:23": "Now there was leaning on Jesusâ€™ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.",
    "John 13:24": "Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, and said to him: Who is it of whom he speaketh?",

    "John 16:23": "And in that day you shall not ask me any thing. Amen, amen I say to you: if you ask the Father any thing in my name, he will give it you.",
    "John 16:24": "Hitherto you have not asked any thing in my name. Ask, and you shall receive; that your joy may be full.",
    "John 16:25": "These things I have spoken to you in proverbs. The hour cometh, when I will no more speak to you in proverbs, but will shew you plainly of the Father.",
    "John 16:26": "In that day you shall ask in my name; and I say not to you, that I will ask the Father for you:",
    "John 16:27": "For the Father himself loveth you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.",

    "John 16:29": "His disciples say to him: Behold, now thou speakest plainly, and speakest no proverb.",
    "John 16:30": "Now we know that thou knowest all things, and thou needest not that any man should ask thee. By this we believe that thou camest forth from God.",
    "John 16:31": "Jesus answered them: Do you now believe?",
    "John 16:32": "Behold, the hour cometh, and it is now come, that you shall be scattered every man to his own, and shall leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.",
    "John 16:33": "These things I have spoken to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you shall have distress: but have confidence, I have overcome the world.",
    "John 17:1": "THESE things Jesus spoke, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said: Father, the hour is come, glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee.",
    "John 17:2": "As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he may give eternal life to all whom thou hast given him.",
    "John 17:3": "Now this is eternal life: That they may know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.",
    "John 17:4": "I have glorified thee on the earth; I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.",
    "John 17:5": "And now glorify thou me, O Father, with thyself, with the glory which I had, before the world was, with thee.",
    "John 17:6": "I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou hast given me out of the world. Thine they were, and to me thou gavest them; and they have kept thy word.",
    "John 17:7": "Now they have known, that all things which thou hast given me, are from thee:",
    "John 17:8": "Because the words which thou gavest me, I have given to them; and they have received them, and have known in very deed that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.",
    "John 17:9": "I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou hast given me: because they are thine:",
    "John 17:10": "And all my things are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.",
    "John 17:11": "And now I am not in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name whom thou has given me; that they may be one, as we also are.",
    "John 17:12": "While I was with them, I kept them in thy name. Those whom thou gavest me have I kept; and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition, that the scripture may be fulfilled.",
    "John 17:13": "And now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy filled in themselves.",
    "John 17:14": "I have given them thy word, and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world; as I also am not of the world.",
    "John 17:15": "I pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world, but that thou shouldst keep them from evil.",
    "John 17:16": "They are not of the world, as I also am not of the world.",
    "John 17:17": "Sanctify them in truth. Thy word is truth.",
    "John 17:18": "As thou hast sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.",
    "John 17:19": "And for them do I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth.",
    "John 17:20": "And not for them only do I pray, but for them also who through their word shall believe in me;",
    "John 17:21": "That they all may be one, as thou, Father, in me, and I in thee; that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.",
    "John 17:22": "And the glory which thou hast given me, I have given to them; that they may be one, as we also are one:",
    "John 17:23": "I in them, and thou in me; that they may be made perfect in one: and the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast also loved me.",
    "John 17:24": "Father, I will that where I am, they also whom thou hast given me may be with me; that they may see my glory which thou hast given me, because thou hast loved me before the creation of the world.",
    "John 17:25": "Just Father, the world hath not known thee; but I have known thee: and these have known that thou hast sent me.",
    "John 17:26": "And I have made known thy name to them, and will make it known; that the love wherewith thou hast loved me, may be in them, and I in them.",

    "John 18:2": "And Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place; because Jesus had often resorted thither together with his disciples.",
    "John 18:3": "Judas therefore having received a band of soldiers and servants from the chief priests and the Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.",
    "John 18:4": "Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said to them: Whom seek ye?",
    "John 18:5": "They answered him: Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith to them: I am he. And Judas also, who betrayed him, stood with them.",
    "John 18:6": "As soon therefore as he had said to them: I am he; they went backward, and fell to the ground.",
    "John 18:7": "Again therefore he asked them: Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.",
    "John 18:8": "Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he. If therefore you seek me, let these go their way.",
    "John 18:9": "That the word might be fulfilled which he said: Of them whom thou hast given me, I have not lost any one.",
    "John 18:10": "Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. And the name of the servant was Malchus.",
    "John 18:11": "Jesus therefore said to Peter: Put up thy sword into the scabbard. The chalice which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?",
    "John 18:12": "Then the band and the tribune, and the servants of the Jews, took Jesus, and bound him:",
    "John 18:13": "And they led him away to Annas first, for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high priest of that year.",
    "John 18:14": "Now Caiphas was he who had given the counsel to the Jews: That it was expedient that one man should die for the people.",
    "John 18:15": "And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. And that disciple was known to the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the court of the high priest.",
    "John 18:16": "But Peter stood at the door without. The other disciple therefore, who was known to the high priest, went out, and spoke to the portress, and brought in Peter.",
    "John 18:17": "The maid therefore that was portress, saith to Peter: Art not thou also one of this manâ€™s disciples? He saith: I am not.",
    "John 18:18": "Now the servants and ministers stood at a fire of coals, because it was cold, and warmed themselves. And with them was Peter also, standing, and warming himself.",
    "John 18:19": "The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.",
    "John 18:20": "Jesus answered him: I have spoken openly to the world: I have always taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither all the Jews resort; and in secret I have spoken nothing.",
    "John 18:21": "Why asketh thou me? ask them who have heard what I have spoken unto them: behold they know what things I have said.",
    "John 18:22": "And when he had said these things, one of the servants standing by, gave Jesus a blow, saying: Answerest thou the high priest so?",
    "John 18:23": "Jesus answered him: If I have spoken evil, give testimony of the evil; but if well, why strikest thou me?",
    "John 18:24": "And Annas sent him bound to Caiphas the high priest.",
    "John 18:25": "And Simon Peter was standing, and warming himself. They said therefore to him: Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said: I am not.",
    "John 18:26": "One of the servants of the high priest (a kinsman to him whose ear Peter cut off) saith to him: Did I not see thee in the garden with him?",
    "John 18:27": "Again therefore Peter denied; and immediately the cock crew.",
    "John 18:28": "Then they led Jesus from Caiphas to the governorâ€™s hall. And it was morning; and they went not into the hall, that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the pasch.",
    "John 18:29": "Pilate therefore went out to them, and said: What accusation bring you against this man?",
    "John 18:30": "They answered, and said to him: If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up to thee.",
    "John 18:31": "Pilate therefore said to them: Take him you, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him: It is not lawful for us to put any man to death;",
    "John 18:32": "That the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he said, signifying what death he should die.",
    "John 18:33": "Pilate therefore went into the hall again, and called Jesus, and said to him: Art thou the king of the Jews?",
    "John 18:34": "Jesus answered: Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or have others told it thee of me?",
    "John 18:35": "Pilate answered: Am I a Jew? Thy own nation, and the chief priests, have delivered thee up to me: what hast thou done?",
    "John 18:36": "Jesus answered: My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would certainly strive that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now my kingdom is not from hence.",
    "John 18:37": "Pilate therefore said to him: Art thou a king then? Jesus answered: Thou sayest that I am a king. For this was I born, and for this came I into the world; that I should give testimony to the truth. Every one that is of the truth, heareth my voice.",
    "John 18:38": "Pilate saith to him: What is truth? And when he said this, he went out again to the Jews, and saith to them: I find no cause in him.",
    "John 18:39": "But you have a custom that I should release one unto you at the pasch: will you, therefore, that I release unto you the king of the Jews?",
    "John 18:40": "Then cried they all again, saying: Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.",
    "John 19:1": "THEN therefore, Pilate took Jesus, and scourged him.",
    "John 19:2": "And the soldiers platting a crown of thorns, put it upon his head; and they put on him a purple garment.",
    "John 19:3": "And they came to him, and said: Hail, king of the Jews; and they gave him blows.",
    "John 19:4": "Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith to them: Behold, I bring him forth unto you, that you may know that I find no cause in him.",
    "John 19:5": "(Jesus therefore came forth, bearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment.) And he saith to them: Behold the Man.",
    "John 19:6": "When the chief priests, therefore, and the servants, had seen him, they cried out, saying: Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith to them: Take him you, and crucify him: for I find no cause in him.",
    "John 19:7": "The Jews answered him: We have a law; and according to the law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.",
    "John 19:8": "When Pilate therefore had heard this saying, he feared the more.",
    "John 19:9": "And he entered into the hall again, and he said to Jesus: Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.",
    "John 19:10": "Pilate therefore saith to him: Speakest thou not to me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and I have power to release thee?",
    "John 19:11": "Jesus answered: Thou shouldst not have any power against me, unless it were given thee from above. Therefore, he that hath delivered me to thee, hath the greater sin.",
    "John 19:12": "And from henceforth Pilate sought to release him. But the Jews cried out, saying: If thou release this man, thou art not Caesarâ€™s friend. For whosoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against Caesar.",
    "John 19:13": "Now when Pilate had heard these words, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat, in the place that is called Lithostrotos, and in Hebrew Gabbatha.",
    "John 19:14": "And it was the parasceve of the pasch, about the sixth hour, and he saith to the Jews: Behold your king.",
    "John 19:15": "But they cried out: Away with him; away with him; crucify him. Pilate saith to them: Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered: We have no king but Caesar.",
