    "Mark 7:5": "And the Pharisees and scribes asked him: Why do not thy disciples walk according to the tradition of the ancients, but they eat bread with common hands?",
    "Mark 7:6": "But he answering, said to them: Well did Isaias prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.",
    "Mark 7:7": "And in vain to they worship me, teaching doctrines and precepts of men.",
    "Mark 7:8": "For leaving the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, the washing of pots and of cups: and many other things you do like to these.",
    "Mark 7:9": "And he said to them: Well do you make void the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition.",
    "Mark 7:10": "For Moses said: Honor thy father and thy mother; and He that shall curse father or mother, dying let him die.",
    "Mark 7:11": "But you say: If a man shall say to his father or mother, Corban, (which is a gift,) whatsoever is from me, shall profit thee.",
    "Mark 7:12": "And further you suffer him not to do any thing for his father or mother,",
    "Mark 7:13": "Making void the word of God by your own tradition, which you have given forth. And many other such like things you do.",
    "Mark 7:14": "And calling again the multitude unto him, he said to them: Hear ye me all, and understand.",
    "Mark 7:15": "There is nothing from without a man that entering into him, can defile him. But the things which come from a man, those are they that defile a man.",
    "Mark 7:16": "If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.",
    "Mark 7:17": "And when he was come into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked him the parable.",
    "Mark 7:18": "And he saith to them: So are you also without knowledge? understand you not that every thing from without, entering into a man cannot defile him:",
    "Mark 7:19": "Because it entereth not into his heart, but goeth into the belly, and goeth out into the privy, purging all meats?",
    "Mark 7:20": "But he said that the things which come out from a man, they defile a man.",
    "Mark 7:21": "For from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,",
    "Mark 7:22": "Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness.",
    "Mark 7:23": "All these evil things come from within, and defile a man.",
    "Mark 7:24": "And rising from thence he went into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon: and entering into a house, he would that no man should know it, and he could not be hid.",
    "Mark 7:25": "For a woman as soon as she heard of him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, came in and fell down at his feet.",
    "Mark 7:26": "For the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophenician born. And she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.",
    "Mark 7:27": "Who said to her: Suffer first the children to be filled: for it is not good to take the bread of the children, and cast it to the dogs.",
    "Mark 7:28": "But she answered and said to him: Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat under the table of the crumbs of the children.",
    "Mark 7:29": "And he said to her: For this saying go thy way, the devil is gone out of thy daughter.",
    "Mark 7:30": "And when she was come into her house, she found the girl lying upon the bed, and that the devil was gone out.",
    "Mark 7:31": "And again going out of the coasts of Tyre, he came by Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.",
    "Mark 7:32": "And they bring to him one deaf and dumb; and they besought him that he would lay his hand upon him.",
    "Mark 7:33": "And taking him from the multitude apart, he put his fingers into his ears, and spitting, he touched his tongue:",
    "Mark 7:34": "And looking up to heaven, he groaned, and said to him: Ephpheta, which is, Be thou opened.",
    "Mark 7:35": "And immediately his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke right.",
    "Mark 7:36": "And he charged them that they should tell no man. But the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal did they publish it.",
    "Mark 7:37": "And so much the more did they wonder, saying: He hath done all things well; he hath made both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.",
    "Mark 8:1": "IN those days again, when there was a great multitude, and had nothing to eat; calling his disciples together, he saith to them:",
    "Mark 8:2": "I have compassion on the multitude, for behold they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat.",
    "Mark 8:3": "And if I shall send them away fasting to their home, they will faint in the way; for some of them came from afar off.",
    "Mark 8:4": "And his disciples answered him: From whence can any one fill them here with bread in the wilderness?",
    "Mark 8:5": "And he asked them: How many loaves have ye? Who said: Seven.",
    "Mark 8:6": "And taking the seven loaves, giving thanks, he broke, and gave to his disciples for to set before them; and they set them before the people.",
    "Mark 8:7": "And they had a few little fishes; and he blessed them, and commanded them to be set before them.",
    "Mark 8:8": "And they did eat and were filled; and they took up that which was left of the fragments, seven baskets.",
    "Mark 8:9": "And they that had eaten were about four thousand; and he sent them away.",
    "Mark 8:10": "And immediately going up into a ship with his disciples, he came into the parts of Dalmanutha.",
    "Mark 8:11": "And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, asking him a sign from heaven, tempting him.",
    "Mark 8:12": "And sighing deeply in spirit, he saith: Why doth this generation seek a sign? Amen, I say to you, a sign shall not be given to this generation.",
    "Mark 8:13": "And leaving them, he went up again into the ship, and passed to the other side of the water.",
    "Mark 8:14": "And they forgot to take bread; and they had but one loaf with them in the ship.",
    "Mark 8:15": "And he charged them, saying: Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.",
    "Mark 8:16": "And they reasoned among themselves, saying: Because we have no bread.",
    "Mark 8:17": "Which Jesus knowing, saith to them: Why do you reason, because you have no bread? do you not yet know nor understand? have you still your heart blinded?",
    "Mark 8:18": "Having eyes, see you not? and having ears, hear you not? neither do you remember.",
    "Mark 8:19": "When I broke the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took you up? They say to him, Twelve.",
    "Mark 8:20": "When also the seven loaves among four thousand, how many baskets of fragments took you up? And they say to him, Seven.",
    "Mark 8:21": "And he said to them: How do you not yet understand?",
    "Mark 8:22": "And they came to Bethsaida; and they bring to him a blind man, and they besought him that he would touch him.",
    "Mark 8:23": "And taking the blind man by the hand, he led him out of the town; and spitting upon his eyes, laying his hands on him, he asked him if he saw any thing.",
    "Mark 8:24": "And looking up, he said: I see men as it were trees, walking.",
    "Mark 8:25": "After that again he laid his hands upon his eyes, and he began to see, and was restored, so that he saw all things clearly.",
    "Mark 8:26": "And he sent him into his house, saying: Go into thy house, and if thou enter into the town, tell nobody.",
    "Mark 8:27": "And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi. And in the way, he asked his disciples, saying to them: Whom do men say that I am?",
    "Mark 8:28": "Who answered him, saying: John the Baptist; but some Elias, and others as one of the prophets.",
    "Mark 8:29": "Then he saith to them: But whom do you say that I am? Peter answering said to him: Thou art the Christ.",
    "Mark 8:30": "And he strictly charged them that they should not tell any man of him.",
    "Mark 8:31": "And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the ancients and by the high priests, and the scribes, and be killed: and after three days rise again.",
    "Mark 8:32": "And he spoke the word openly. And Peter taking him, began to rebuke him.",
    "Mark 8:33": "Who turning about and seeing his disciples, threatened Peter, saying: Go behind me, Satan, because thou savorest not the things that are of God, but that are of men.",
    "Mark 8:34": "And calling the multitude together with his disciples, he said to them: If any man will follow me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.",
    "Mark 8:35": "For whosoever will save his life, shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel, shall save it.",
    "Mark 8:36": "For what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and suffer the loss of his soul?",
    "Mark 8:37": "Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?",
    "Mark 8:38": "For he that shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, in this adulterous and sinful generation: the Son of man also will be ashamed of him, when he shall come in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.",
    "Mark 9:1": "And he said to them: Amen I say to you, that there are some of them that stand here, who shall not taste death, till they see the kingdom of God coming in power.",
    "Mark 9:2": "AND after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter and James and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves, and was transfigured before them.",
    "Mark 9:3": "And his garments became shining and exceeding white as snow, so as no fuller upon earth can make white.",
    "Mark 9:4": "And there appeared to them Elias with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus.",
    "Mark 9:5": "And Peter answering, said to Jesus: Rabbi, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.",
    "Mark 9:6": "For he knew not what he said: for they were struck with fear.",
    "Mark 9:7": "And there was a cloud overshadowing them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying: This is my most beloved son; hear ye him.",
    "Mark 9:8": "And immediately looking about, they saw no man any more, but Jesus only with them.",
    "Mark 9:9": "And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them not to tell any man what things they had seen, till the Son of man shall be risen again from the dead.",
    "Mark 9:10": "And they kept the word to themselves; questioning together what that should mean, when he shall be risen from the dead.",
    "Mark 9:11": "And they asked him, saying: Why then do the Pharisees and scribes say that Elias must come first?",
    "Mark 9:12": "Who answering, said to them: Elias, when he shall come first, shall restore all things; and as it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things and be despised.",
    "Mark 9:13": "But I say to you, that Elias also is come, (and they have done to him whatsoever they would,) as it is written of him.",
    "Mark 9:14": "And coming to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes disputing with them.",
    "Mark 9:15": "And presently all the people seeing Jesus, were astonished and struck with fear; and running to him, they saluted him.",
    "Mark 9:16": "And he asked them: What do you question about among you?",
    "Mark 9:17": "And one of the multitude, answering, said: Master, I have brought my son to thee, having a dumb spirit.",
    "Mark 9:18": "Who, wheresoever he taketh him, dasheth him, and he foameth, and gnasheth with the teeth, and pineth away; and I spoke to thy disciples to cast him out, and they could not.",
    "Mark 9:19": "Who answering them, said: O incredulous generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.",
    "Mark 9:20": "And they brought him. And when he had seen him, immediately the spirit troubled him; and being thrown down upon the ground, he rolled about foaming.",
    "Mark 9:21": "And he asked his father: How long time is it since this hath happened unto him? But he said: From his infancy:",
    "Mark 9:22": "And oftentimes hath he cast him into the fire and into waters to destroy him. But if thou canst do any thing, help us, having compassion on us.",
    "Mark 9:23": "And Jesus saith to him: If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.",
    "Mark 9:24": "And immediately the father of the boy crying out, with tears said: I do believe, Lord: help my unbelief.",
    "Mark 9:25": "And when Jesus saw the multitude running together, he threatened the unclean spirit, saying to him: Deaf and dumb spirit, I command thee, go out of him; and enter not any more into him.",
    "Mark 9:26": "And crying out, and greatly tearing him, he went out of him, and he became as dead, so that many said: He is dead.",
    "Mark 9:27": "But Jesus taking him by the hand, lifted him up; and he arose.",
    "Mark 9:28": "And when he was come into the house, his disciples secretly asked him: Why could not we cast him out?",
    "Mark 9:29": "And he said to them: This kind can go out by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.",
    "Mark 9:30": "And departing from thence, they passed through Galilee, and he would not that any man should know it.",
    "Mark 9:31": "And he taught his disciple, and said to them: The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise again the third day.",
    "Mark 9:32": "But they understood not the word, and they were afraid to ask him.",
    "Mark 9:33": "And they came to Capharnaum. And when they were in the house, he asked them: What did you treat of in the way?",
    "Mark 9:34": "But they held their peace, for in the way they had disputed among themselves, which of them should be the greatest.",
    "Mark 9:35": "And sitting down, he called the twelve, and saith to them: If any man desire to be first, he shall be the last of all, and the minister of all.",
    "Mark 9:36": "And taking a child, he set him in the midst of them. Whom when he had embraced, he saith to them:",
    "Mark 9:37": "Whosoever shall receive one such child as this in my name, receiveth me. And whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.",
    "Mark 9:38": "John answered him, saying: Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, who followeth not us, and we forbade him.",
    "Mark 9:39": "But Jesus said: Do not forbid him. For there is no man that doth a miracle in my name, and can soon speak ill of me.",
    "Mark 9:40": "For he that is not against you, is for you.",
    "Mark 9:41": "For whosoever shall give you to drink a cup of water in my name, because you belong to Christ: amen I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.",
    "Mark 9:42": "And whosoever shall scandalize one of these little ones that believe in me; it were better for him that a millstone were hanged around his neck, and he were cast into the sea.",
    "Mark 9:43": "And if thy hand scandalize thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life, maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into unquenchable fire:",
    "Mark 9:44": "Where there worm dieth not, and the fire is not extinguished.",
    "Mark 9:45": "And if thy foot scandalize thee, cut it off. It is better for thee to enter lame into life everlasting, than having two feet, to be cast into the hell of unquenchable fire:",
    "Mark 9:46": "Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not extinguished.",
    "Mark 9:47": "And if thy eye scandalize thee, pluck it out. It is better for thee with one eye to enter into the kingdom of God, than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire:",
    "Mark 9:48": "Where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not extinguished.",
    "Mark 9:49": "For every one shall be salted with fire: and every victim shall be salted with salt.",
    "Mark 9:50": "Salt is good. But if the salt became unsavory; wherewith will you season it? Have salt in you, and have peace among you.",

    "Mark 10:2": "And the Pharisees coming to him asked him: Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.",
    "Mark 10:3": "But he answering, saith to them: What did Moses command you?",
    "Mark 10:4": "Who said: Moses permitted to write a bill of divorce, and to put her away.",
    "Mark 10:5": "To whom Jesus answering, said: Because of the hardness of your heart he wrote you that precept.",
    "Mark 10:6": "But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.",
    "Mark 10:7": "For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother; and shall cleave to his wife.",

    "Mark 10:18": "And Jesus said to him, Why callest thou me good? None is good but one, that is God.",
    "Mark 10:19": "Thou knowest the commandments: Do not commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, bear not false witness, do no fraud, honour thy father and mother.",
    "Mark 10:20": "But he answering, said to him: Master, all these things I have observed from my youth.",
    "Mark 10:21": "And Jesus looking on him, loved him, and said to him: One thing is wanting unto thee: go, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.",
    "Mark 10:22": "Who being struck sad at that saying, went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.",
    "Mark 10:23": "And Jesus looking round about, saith to his disciples: How hardly shall they that have riches, enter into the kingdom of God!",
    "Mark 10:24": "And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus again answering, saith to them: Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches, to enter into the kingdom of God?",

    "Mark 12:17": "And Jesus answering, said to them: Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesarâ€™s, and to God the things that are Godâ€™s. And they marvelled at him.",
    "Mark 12:18": "And there came to him the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying:",
    "Mark 12:19": "Master, Moses wrote unto us, that if any manâ€™s brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.",
    "Mark 12:20": "Now there were seven brethren; and the first took a wife, and died leaving no issue.",

    "Mark 13:18": "But pray ye, that these things happen not in winter.",
    "Mark 13:19": "For in those days shall be such tribulations, as were not from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, neither shall be.",
    "Mark 13:20": "And unless the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh should be saved: but for the sake of the elect which he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.",
    "Mark 13:21": "And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; lo, he is here: do not believe.",
    "Mark 13:22": "For there will rise up false Christs and false prophets, and they shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce (if it were possible) even the elect.",

    "Mark 14:20": "Who saith to them: One of the twelve, who dippeth with me his hand in the dish.",
    "Mark 14:21": "And the Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed. It were better for him, if that man had not been born.",

    "Luke 8:30": "And Jesus asked him, saying: What is thy name? But he said: Legion; because many devils were entered into him.",
    "Luke 8:31": "And they besought him that he would not command them to go into the abyss.",
    "Luke 8:32": "And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain; and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.",

    "Luke 11:40": "Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without, make also that which is within?",
    "Luke 11:41": "But yet that which remaineth, give alms; and behold, all things are clean unto you.",
    "Luke 11:42": "But woe to you, Pharisees, because you tithe mint and rue and every herb; and pass over judgment, and the charity of God. Now these things you ought to have done, and not to leave the other undone.",
    "Luke 11:43": "Woe to you, Pharisees, because you love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and salutations in the marketplace.",

    "Luke 14:30": "Saying: This man began to build, and was not able to finish.",
    "Luke 14:31": "Or what king, about to go to make war against another king, doth not first sit down, and think whether he be able, with ten thousand, to meet him that, with twenty thousand, cometh against him?",
    "Luke 14:32": "Or else, whilst the other is yet afar off, sending an embassy, he desireth conditions of peace.",

    "Luke 15:5": "And when he hath found it, lay it upon his shoulders, rejoicing:",
    "Luke 15:6": "And coming home, call together his friends and neighbours, saying to them: Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost?",
    "Luke 15:7": "I say to you, that even so there shall be joy in heaven upon one sinner that doth penance, more than upon ninety-nine just who need not penance.",
    "Luke 15:8": "Or what woman having ten groats; if she lose one groat, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently until she find it?",
    "Luke 15:9": "And when she hath found it, call together her friends and neighbours, saying: Rejoice with me, because I have found the groat which I had lost.",

    "Luke 15:29": "And he answering, said to his father: Behold, for so many years do I serve thee, and I have never transgressed thy commandment, and yet thou hast never given me a kid to make merry with my friends:",
    "Luke 15:30": "But as soon as this thy son is come, who hath devoured his substance with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.",
    "Luke 15:31": "But he said to him: Son, thou art always with me, and all I have is thine.",
    "Luke 15:32": "But it was fit that we should make merry and be glad, for this thy brother was dead and is come to life again; he was lost, and is found.",

    "Luke 16:15": "And he said to them: You are they who justify yourselves before men, but God knoweth your hearts; for that which is high to men, is an abomination before God.",
    "Luke 16:16": "The law and the prophets were until John; from that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every one useth violence towards it.",
    "Luke 16:17": "And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fall.",
    "Luke 16:18": "Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth her that is put away from her husband, commmitteth adultery.",

    "Luke 16:24": "And he cried, and said: Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, to cool my tongue: for I am tormented in this flame.",
    "Luke 16:25": "And Abraham said to him: Son, remember that thou didst receive good things in thy lifetime, and likewise Lazareth evil things, but now he is comforted; and thou art tormented.",
    "Luke 16:26": "And besides all this, between us and you, there is fixed a great chaos: so that they who would pass from hence to you, cannot, nor from thence come hither.",
    "Luke 16:27": "And he said: Then, father, I beseech thee, that thou wouldst send him to my fatherâ€™s house, for I have five brethren,",
    "Luke 16:28": "That he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torments.",
    "Luke 16:29": "And Abraham said to him: They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.",
    "Luke 16:30": "But he said: No, father Abraham: but if one went to them from the dead, they will do penance.",
    "Luke 16:31": "And he said to him: If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they believe, if one rise again from the dead.",
    "Luke 17:1": "AND he said to his disciples: It is impossible that scandals should not come: but woe to him through whom they come.",
    "Luke 17:2": "It were better for him, that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should scandalize one of these little ones.",
    "Luke 17:3": "Take heed to yourselves. If thy brother sin against thee, reprove him: and if he do penance, forgive him.",
    "Luke 17:4": "And if he sin against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day be converted unto thee, saying, I repent; forgive him.",

    "Luke 17:9": "Doth he thank that servant, for doing the things which he commanded him?",
    "Luke 17:10": "I think not. So you also, when you shall have done all these things that are commanded you, say: We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which we ought to do.",
    "Luke 17:11": "And it came to pass, as he was going to Jerusalem, he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.",
    "Luke 17:12": "And as he entered into a certain town, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off;",
    "Luke 17:13": "And lifted up their voice, saying: Jesus, master, have mercy on us.",
    "Luke 17:14": "Whom when he saw, he said: Go, shew yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, as they went, they were made clean.",

    "Luke 17:22": "And he said to his disciples: The days will come, when you shall desire to see one day of the Son of man; and you shall not see it.",
    "Luke 17:23": "And they will say to you: See here, and see there. Go ye not after, nor follow them:",
    "Luke 17:24": "For as the lightening that lighteneth from under heaven, shineth unto the parts that are under heaven, so shall the Son of man be in his day.",
    "Luke 17:25": "But first he must suffer many things, and be rejected by this generation.",
    "Luke 17:26": "And as it came to pass in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.",
    "Luke 17:27": "They did eat and drink, they married wives, and were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark: and the flood came and destroyed them all.",

    "Luke 17:29": "And in the day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.",
    "Luke 17:30": "Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man shall be revealed.",
    "Luke 17:31": "In that hour, he that shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and he that shall be in the field, in like manner, let him not return back.",
    "Luke 17:32": "Remember Lotâ€™s wife.",

    "Luke 18:3": "And there was a certain widow in that city, and she came to him, saying: Avenge me of my adversary.",
    "Luke 18:4": "And he would not for a long time. But afterwards he said within himself: Although I fear not God, nor regard man,",
    "Luke 18:5": "Yet because this widow is troublesome to me, I will avenge her, lest continually coming she weary me.",
    "Luke 18:6": "And the Lord said: Hear what the unjust judge saith.",
    "Luke 18:7": "And will not God revenge his elect who cry to him day and night: and will he have patience in their regard?",
    "Luke 18:8": "I say to you, that he will quickly revenge them. But yet the Son of man, when he cometh, shall he find, think you, faith on earth?",
    "Luke 18:9": "And to some who trusted in themselves as just, and despised others, he spoke also this parable:",
    "Luke 18:10": "Two men went up into the temple to pray: the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.",
    "Luke 18:11": "The Pharisee standing, prayed thus with himself: O God, I give thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, as also is this publican.",
    "Luke 18:12": "I fast twice in a week: I give tithes of all that I possess.",
    "Luke 18:13": "And the publican, standing afar off, would not so much as lift up his eyes towards heaven; but struck his breast, saying: O god, be merciful to me a sinner.",
    "Luke 18:14": "I say to you, this man went down into his house justified rather that the other: because every one that exalteth himself, shall be humbled: and he that humbleth himself, shall be exalted.",
    "Luke 18:15": "And they brought unto him also infants, that he might touch them. Which when the disciples saw, they rebuked them.",
    "Luke 18:16": "But Jesus, calling them together, said: Suffer children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.",

    "Luke 18:21": "Who said: All these things have I kept from my youth.",
    "Luke 18:22": "Which when Jesus had heard, he said to him: Yet one thing is wanting to thee: sell all whatever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.",
    "Luke 18:23": "He having heard these things, became sorrowful; for he was very rich.",
    "Luke 18:24": "And Jesus seeing him become sorrowful, said: How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God.",

    "Luke 19:5": "And when Jesus was come to the place, looking up, he saw him, and said to him: Zacheus, make haste and come down; for this day I must abide in thy house.",
    "Luke 19:6": "And he made haste and came down; and received him with joy.",
    "Luke 19:7": "And when all saw it, they murmured, saying, that he was gone to be a guest with a man that was a sinner.",
    "Luke 19:8": "But Zacheus standing, said to the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have wronged any man of any thing, I restore him fourfold.",
    "Luke 19:9": "Jesus said to him: This day is salvation come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.",
    "Luke 19:10": "For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.",

    "Luke 20:4": "The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?",
    "Luke 20:5": "But they thought within themselves, saying: If we shall say, From heaven: he will say: Why then did you not believe him?",
    "Luke 20:6": "But if we say, Of men, the whole people will stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.",
    "Luke 20:7": "And they answered, that they knew not whence it was.",
