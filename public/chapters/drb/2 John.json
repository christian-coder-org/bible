    "Mark 7:5": "And the Pharisees and scribes asked him: Why do not thy disciples walk according to the tradition of the ancients, but they eat bread with common hands?",
    "Mark 7:6": "But he answering, said to them: Well did Isaias prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.",
    "Mark 7:7": "And in vain to they worship me, teaching doctrines and precepts of men.",
    "Mark 7:8": "For leaving the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, the washing of pots and of cups: and many other things you do like to these.",
    "Mark 7:9": "And he said to them: Well do you make void the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition.",
    "Mark 7:10": "For Moses said: Honor thy father and thy mother; and He that shall curse father or mother, dying let him die.",
    "Mark 7:11": "But you say: If a man shall say to his father or mother, Corban, (which is a gift,) whatsoever is from me, shall profit thee.",
    "Mark 7:12": "And further you suffer him not to do any thing for his father or mother,",
    "Mark 7:13": "Making void the word of God by your own tradition, which you have given forth. And many other such like things you do.",
    "Mark 7:14": "And calling again the multitude unto him, he said to them: Hear ye me all, and understand.",
    "Mark 7:15": "There is nothing from without a man that entering into him, can defile him. But the things which come from a man, those are they that defile a man.",
    "Mark 7:16": "If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.",
    "Mark 7:17": "And when he was come into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked him the parable.",
    "Mark 7:18": "And he saith to them: So are you also without knowledge? understand you not that every thing from without, entering into a man cannot defile him:",
    "Mark 7:19": "Because it entereth not into his heart, but goeth into the belly, and goeth out into the privy, purging all meats?",
    "Mark 7:20": "But he said that the things which come out from a man, they defile a man.",
    "Mark 7:21": "For from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,",
    "Mark 7:22": "Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness.",
    "Mark 7:23": "All these evil things come from within, and defile a man.",
    "Mark 7:24": "And rising from thence he went into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon: and entering into a house, he would that no man should know it, and he could not be hid.",
    "Mark 7:25": "For a woman as soon as she heard of him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, came in and fell down at his feet.",
    "Mark 7:26": "For the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophenician born. And she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.",
    "Mark 7:27": "Who said to her: Suffer first the children to be filled: for it is not good to take the bread of the children, and cast it to the dogs.",
    "Mark 7:28": "But she answered and said to him: Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat under the table of the crumbs of the children.",
    "Mark 7:29": "And he said to her: For this saying go thy way, the devil is gone out of thy daughter.",
    "Mark 7:30": "And when she was come into her house, she found the girl lying upon the bed, and that the devil was gone out.",
    "Mark 7:31": "And again going out of the coasts of Tyre, he came by Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.",
    "Mark 7:32": "And they bring to him one deaf and dumb; and they besought him that he would lay his hand upon him.",
    "Mark 7:33": "And taking him from the multitude apart, he put his fingers into his ears, and spitting, he touched his tongue:",
    "Mark 7:34": "And looking up to heaven, he groaned, and said to him: Ephpheta, which is, Be thou opened.",
    "Mark 7:35": "And immediately his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke right.",
    "Mark 7:36": "And he charged them that they should tell no man. But the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal did they publish it.",
    "Mark 7:37": "And so much the more did they wonder, saying: He hath done all things well; he hath made both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.",
    "Mark 8:1": "IN those days again, when there was a great multitude, and had nothing to eat; calling his disciples together, he saith to them:",
    "Mark 8:2": "I have compassion on the multitude, for behold they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat.",
    "Mark 8:3": "And if I shall send them away fasting to their home, they will faint in the way; for some of them came from afar off.",
    "Mark 8:4": "And his disciples answered him: From whence can any one fill them here with bread in the wilderness?",
    "Mark 8:5": "And he asked them: How many loaves have ye? Who said: Seven.",
    "Mark 8:6": "And taking the seven loaves, giving thanks, he broke, and gave to his disciples for to set before them; and they set them before the people.",
    "Mark 8:7": "And they had a few little fishes; and he blessed them, and commanded them to be set before them.",
    "Mark 8:8": "And they did eat and were filled; and they took up that which was left of the fragments, seven baskets.",
    "Mark 8:9": "And they that had eaten were about four thousand; and he sent them away.",
    "Mark 8:10": "And immediately going up into a ship with his disciples, he came into the parts of Dalmanutha.",
    "Mark 8:11": "And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, asking him a sign from heaven, tempting him.",
    "Mark 8:12": "And sighing deeply in spirit, he saith: Why doth this generation seek a sign? Amen, I say to you, a sign shall not be given to this generation.",
    "Mark 8:13": "And leaving them, he went up again into the ship, and passed to the other side of the water.",
    "Mark 8:14": "And they forgot to take bread; and they had but one loaf with them in the ship.",
    "Mark 8:15": "And he charged them, saying: Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.",
    "Mark 8:16": "And they reasoned among themselves, saying: Because we have no bread.",
    "Mark 8:17": "Which Jesus knowing, saith to them: Why do you reason, because you have no bread? do you not yet know nor understand? have you still your heart blinded?",
    "Mark 8:18": "Having eyes, see you not? and having ears, hear you not? neither do you remember.",
    "Mark 8:19": "When I broke the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took you up? They say to him, Twelve.",
    "Mark 8:20": "When also the seven loaves among four thousand, how many baskets of fragments took you up? And they say to him, Seven.",
    "Mark 8:21": "And he said to them: How do you not yet understand?",
    "Mark 8:22": "And they came to Bethsaida; and they bring to him a blind man, and they besought him that he would touch him.",
    "Mark 8:23": "And taking the blind man by the hand, he led him out of the town; and spitting upon his eyes, laying his hands on him, he asked him if he saw any thing.",
    "Mark 8:24": "And looking up, he said: I see men as it were trees, walking.",
    "Mark 8:25": "After that again he laid his hands upon his eyes, and he began to see, and was restored, so that he saw all things clearly.",
    "Mark 8:26": "And he sent him into his house, saying: Go into thy house, and if thou enter into the town, tell nobody.",
    "Mark 8:27": "And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi. And in the way, he asked his disciples, saying to them: Whom do men say that I am?",
    "Mark 8:28": "Who answered him, saying: John the Baptist; but some Elias, and others as one of the prophets.",
    "Mark 8:29": "Then he saith to them: But whom do you say that I am? Peter answering said to him: Thou art the Christ.",
    "Mark 8:30": "And he strictly charged them that they should not tell any man of him.",
    "Mark 8:31": "And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the ancients and by the high priests, and the scribes, and be killed: and after three days rise again.",
    "Mark 8:32": "And he spoke the word openly. And Peter taking him, began to rebuke him.",
    "Mark 8:33": "Who turning about and seeing his disciples, threatened Peter, saying: Go behind me, Satan, because thou savorest not the things that are of God, but that are of men.",
    "Mark 8:34": "And calling the multitude together with his disciples, he said to them: If any man will follow me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.",
    "Mark 8:35": "For whosoever will save his life, shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel, shall save it.",
    "Mark 8:36": "For what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and suffer the loss of his soul?",
    "Mark 8:37": "Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?",
    "Mark 8:38": "For he that shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, in this adulterous and sinful generation: the Son of man also will be ashamed of him, when he shall come in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.",
    "Mark 9:1": "And he said to them: Amen I say to you, that there are some of them that stand here, who shall not taste death, till they see the kingdom of God coming in power.",
    "Mark 9:2": "AND after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter and James and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves, and was transfigured before them.",
    "Mark 9:3": "And his garments became shining and exceeding white as snow, so as no fuller upon earth can make white.",
    "Mark 9:4": "And there appeared to them Elias with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus.",
    "Mark 9:5": "And Peter answering, said to Jesus: Rabbi, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.",
    "Mark 9:6": "For he knew not what he said: for they were struck with fear.",
    "Mark 9:7": "And there was a cloud overshadowing them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying: This is my most beloved son; hear ye him.",
    "Mark 9:8": "And immediately looking about, they saw no man any more, but Jesus only with them.",
    "Mark 9:9": "And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them not to tell any man what things they had seen, till the Son of man shall be risen again from the dead.",
    "Mark 9:10": "And they kept the word to themselves; questioning together what that should mean, when he shall be risen from the dead.",
    "Mark 9:11": "And they asked him, saying: Why then do the Pharisees and scribes say that Elias must come first?",
    "Mark 9:12": "Who answering, said to them: Elias, when he shall come first, shall restore all things; and as it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things and be despised.",
    "Mark 9:13": "But I say to you, that Elias also is come, (and they have done to him whatsoever they would,) as it is written of him.",
    "Mark 9:14": "And coming to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes disputing with them.",
    "Mark 9:15": "And presently all the people seeing Jesus, were astonished and struck with fear; and running to him, they saluted him.",
    "Mark 9:16": "And he asked them: What do you question about among you?",
    "Mark 9:17": "And one of the multitude, answering, said: Master, I have brought my son to thee, having a dumb spirit.",
    "Mark 9:18": "Who, wheresoever he taketh him, dasheth him, and he foameth, and gnasheth with the teeth, and pineth away; and I spoke to thy disciples to cast him out, and they could not.",
    "Mark 9:19": "Who answering them, said: O incredulous generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.",
    "Mark 9:20": "And they brought him. And when he had seen him, immediately the spirit troubled him; and being thrown down upon the ground, he rolled about foaming.",
    "Mark 9:21": "And he asked his father: How long time is it since this hath happened unto him? But he said: From his infancy:",
    "Mark 9:22": "And oftentimes hath he cast him into the fire and into waters to destroy him. But if thou canst do any thing, help us, having compassion on us.",
    "Mark 9:23": "And Jesus saith to him: If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.",
    "Mark 9:24": "And immediately the father of the boy crying out, with tears said: I do believe, Lord: help my unbelief.",
    "Mark 9:25": "And when Jesus saw the multitude running together, he threatened the unclean spirit, saying to him: Deaf and dumb spirit, I command thee, go out of him; and enter not any more into him.",
    "Mark 9:26": "And crying out, and greatly tearing him, he went out of him, and he became as dead, so that many said: He is dead.",
    "Mark 9:27": "But Jesus taking him by the hand, lifted him up; and he arose.",
    "Mark 9:28": "And when he was come into the house, his disciples secretly asked him: Why could not we cast him out?",
    "Mark 9:29": "And he said to them: This kind can go out by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.",
    "Mark 9:30": "And departing from thence, they passed through Galilee, and he would not that any man should know it.",
    "Mark 9:31": "And he taught his disciple, and said to them: The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise again the third day.",
    "Mark 9:32": "But they understood not the word, and they were afraid to ask him.",
    "Mark 9:33": "And they came to Capharnaum. And when they were in the house, he asked them: What did you treat of in the way?",
    "Mark 9:34": "But they held their peace, for in the way they had disputed among themselves, which of them should be the greatest.",
    "Mark 9:35": "And sitting down, he called the twelve, and saith to them: If any man desire to be first, he shall be the last of all, and the minister of all.",
    "Mark 9:36": "And taking a child, he set him in the midst of them. Whom when he had embraced, he saith to them:",
    "Mark 9:37": "Whosoever shall receive one such child as this in my name, receiveth me. And whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.",
    "Mark 9:38": "John answered him, saying: Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, who followeth not us, and we forbade him.",
    "Mark 9:39": "But Jesus said: Do not forbid him. For there is no man that doth a miracle in my name, and can soon speak ill of me.",
    "Mark 9:40": "For he that is not against you, is for you.",
    "Mark 9:41": "For whosoever shall give you to drink a cup of water in my name, because you belong to Christ: amen I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.",
    "Mark 9:42": "And whosoever shall scandalize one of these little ones that believe in me; it were better for him that a millstone were hanged around his neck, and he were cast into the sea.",
    "Mark 9:43": "And if thy hand scandalize thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life, maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into unquenchable fire:",
    "Mark 9:44": "Where there worm dieth not, and the fire is not extinguished.",
    "Mark 9:45": "And if thy foot scandalize thee, cut it off. It is better for thee to enter lame into life everlasting, than having two feet, to be cast into the hell of unquenchable fire:",
    "Mark 9:46": "Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not extinguished.",
    "Mark 9:47": "And if thy eye scandalize thee, pluck it out. It is better for thee with one eye to enter into the kingdom of God, than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire:",
    "Mark 9:48": "Where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not extinguished.",
    "Mark 9:49": "For every one shall be salted with fire: and every victim shall be salted with salt.",
    "Mark 9:50": "Salt is good. But if the salt became unsavory; wherewith will you season it? Have salt in you, and have peace among you.",

    "Mark 10:2": "And the Pharisees coming to him asked him: Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.",
    "Mark 10:3": "But he answering, saith to them: What did Moses command you?",
    "Mark 10:4": "Who said: Moses permitted to write a bill of divorce, and to put her away.",
    "Mark 10:5": "To whom Jesus answering, said: Because of the hardness of your heart he wrote you that precept.",
    "Mark 10:6": "But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.",
    "Mark 10:7": "For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother; and shall cleave to his wife.",

    "Mark 10:18": "And Jesus said to him, Why callest thou me good? None is good but one, that is God.",
    "Mark 10:19": "Thou knowest the commandments: Do not commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, bear not false witness, do no fraud, honour thy father and mother.",
    "Mark 10:20": "But he answering, said to him: Master, all these things I have observed from my youth.",
    "Mark 10:21": "And Jesus looking on him, loved him, and said to him: One thing is wanting unto thee: go, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.",
    "Mark 10:22": "Who being struck sad at that saying, went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.",
    "Mark 10:23": "And Jesus looking round about, saith to his disciples: How hardly shall they that have riches, enter into the kingdom of God!",
    "Mark 10:24": "And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus again answering, saith to them: Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches, to enter into the kingdom of God?",

    "Mark 12:17": "And Jesus answering, said to them: Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesarâ€™s, and to God the things that are Godâ€™s. And they marvelled at him.",
    "Mark 12:18": "And there came to him the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying:",
    "Mark 12:19": "Master, Moses wrote unto us, that if any manâ€™s brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.",
    "Mark 12:20": "Now there were seven brethren; and the first took a wife, and died leaving no issue.",

    "Mark 13:18": "But pray ye, that these things happen not in winter.",
    "Mark 13:19": "For in those days shall be such tribulations, as were not from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, neither shall be.",
    "Mark 13:20": "And unless the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh should be saved: but for the sake of the elect which he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.",
    "Mark 13:21": "And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; lo, he is here: do not believe.",
    "Mark 13:22": "For there will rise up false Christs and false prophets, and they shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce (if it were possible) even the elect.",

    "Mark 14:20": "Who saith to them: One of the twelve, who dippeth with me his hand in the dish.",
    "Mark 14:21": "And the Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed. It were better for him, if that man had not been born.",

    "Luke 8:30": "And Jesus asked him, saying: What is thy name? But he said: Legion; because many devils were entered into him.",
    "Luke 8:31": "And they besought him that he would not command them to go into the abyss.",
    "Luke 8:32": "And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain; and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.",

    "Luke 11:40": "Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without, make also that which is within?",
    "Luke 11:41": "But yet that which remaineth, give alms; and behold, all things are clean unto you.",
    "Luke 11:42": "But woe to you, Pharisees, because you tithe mint and rue and every herb; and pass over judgment, and the charity of God. Now these things you ought to have done, and not to leave the other undone.",
    "Luke 11:43": "Woe to you, Pharisees, because you love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and salutations in the marketplace.",

    "Luke 14:30": "Saying: This man began to build, and was not able to finish.",
    "Luke 14:31": "Or what king, about to go to make war against another king, doth not first sit down, and think whether he be able, with ten thousand, to meet him that, with twenty thousand, cometh against him?",
    "Luke 14:32": "Or else, whilst the other is yet afar off, sending an embassy, he desireth conditions of peace.",

    "Luke 15:5": "And when he hath found it, lay it upon his shoulders, rejoicing:",
    "Luke 15:6": "And coming home, call together his friends and neighbours, saying to them: Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost?",
    "Luke 15:7": "I say to you, that even so there shall be joy in heaven upon one sinner that doth penance, more than upon ninety-nine just who need not penance.",
    "Luke 15:8": "Or what woman having ten groats; if she lose one groat, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently until she find it?",
    "Luke 15:9": "And when she hath found it, call together her friends and neighbours, saying: Rejoice with me, because I have found the groat which I had lost.",

    "Luke 15:29": "And he answering, said to his father: Behold, for so many years do I serve thee, and I have never transgressed thy commandment, and yet thou hast never given me a kid to make merry with my friends:",
    "Luke 15:30": "But as soon as this thy son is come, who hath devoured his substance with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.",
    "Luke 15:31": "But he said to him: Son, thou art always with me, and all I have is thine.",
    "Luke 15:32": "But it was fit that we should make merry and be glad, for this thy brother was dead and is come to life again; he was lost, and is found.",

    "Luke 16:15": "And he said to them: You are they who justify yourselves before men, but God knoweth your hearts; for that which is high to men, is an abomination before God.",
    "Luke 16:16": "The law and the prophets were until John; from that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every one useth violence towards it.",
    "Luke 16:17": "And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fall.",
    "Luke 16:18": "Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth her that is put away from her husband, commmitteth adultery.",

    "Luke 16:24": "And he cried, and said: Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, to cool my tongue: for I am tormented in this flame.",
    "Luke 16:25": "And Abraham said to him: Son, remember that thou didst receive good things in thy lifetime, and likewise Lazareth evil things, but now he is comforted; and thou art tormented.",
    "Luke 16:26": "And besides all this, between us and you, there is fixed a great chaos: so that they who would pass from hence to you, cannot, nor from thence come hither.",
    "Luke 16:27": "And he said: Then, father, I beseech thee, that thou wouldst send him to my fatherâ€™s house, for I have five brethren,",
    "Luke 16:28": "That he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torments.",
    "Luke 16:29": "And Abraham said to him: They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.",
    "Luke 16:30": "But he said: No, father Abraham: but if one went to them from the dead, they will do penance.",
    "Luke 16:31": "And he said to him: If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they believe, if one rise again from the dead.",
    "Luke 17:1": "AND he said to his disciples: It is impossible that scandals should not come: but woe to him through whom they come.",
    "Luke 17:2": "It were better for him, that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should scandalize one of these little ones.",
    "Luke 17:3": "Take heed to yourselves. If thy brother sin against thee, reprove him: and if he do penance, forgive him.",
    "Luke 17:4": "And if he sin against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day be converted unto thee, saying, I repent; forgive him.",

    "Luke 17:9": "Doth he thank that servant, for doing the things which he commanded him?",
    "Luke 17:10": "I think not. So you also, when you shall have done all these things that are commanded you, say: We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which we ought to do.",
    "Luke 17:11": "And it came to pass, as he was going to Jerusalem, he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.",
    "Luke 17:12": "And as he entered into a certain town, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off;",
    "Luke 17:13": "And lifted up their voice, saying: Jesus, master, have mercy on us.",
    "Luke 17:14": "Whom when he saw, he said: Go, shew yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, as they went, they were made clean.",

    "Luke 17:22": "And he said to his disciples: The days will come, when you shall desire to see one day of the Son of man; and you shall not see it.",
    "Luke 17:23": "And they will say to you: See here, and see there. Go ye not after, nor follow them:",
    "Luke 17:24": "For as the lightening that lighteneth from under heaven, shineth unto the parts that are under heaven, so shall the Son of man be in his day.",
    "Luke 17:25": "But first he must suffer many things, and be rejected by this generation.",
    "Luke 17:26": "And as it came to pass in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.",
    "Luke 17:27": "They did eat and drink, they married wives, and were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark: and the flood came and destroyed them all.",

    "Luke 17:29": "And in the day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.",
    "Luke 17:30": "Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man shall be revealed.",
    "Luke 17:31": "In that hour, he that shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and he that shall be in the field, in like manner, let him not return back.",
    "Luke 17:32": "Remember Lotâ€™s wife.",

    "Luke 18:3": "And there was a certain widow in that city, and she came to him, saying: Avenge me of my adversary.",
    "Luke 18:4": "And he would not for a long time. But afterwards he said within himself: Although I fear not God, nor regard man,",
    "Luke 18:5": "Yet because this widow is troublesome to me, I will avenge her, lest continually coming she weary me.",
    "Luke 18:6": "And the Lord said: Hear what the unjust judge saith.",
    "Luke 18:7": "And will not God revenge his elect who cry to him day and night: and will he have patience in their regard?",
    "Luke 18:8": "I say to you, that he will quickly revenge them. But yet the Son of man, when he cometh, shall he find, think you, faith on earth?",
    "Luke 18:9": "And to some who trusted in themselves as just, and despised others, he spoke also this parable:",
    "Luke 18:10": "Two men went up into the temple to pray: the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.",
    "Luke 18:11": "The Pharisee standing, prayed thus with himself: O God, I give thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, as also is this publican.",
    "Luke 18:12": "I fast twice in a week: I give tithes of all that I possess.",
    "Luke 18:13": "And the publican, standing afar off, would not so much as lift up his eyes towards heaven; but struck his breast, saying: O god, be merciful to me a sinner.",
    "Luke 18:14": "I say to you, this man went down into his house justified rather that the other: because every one that exalteth himself, shall be humbled: and he that humbleth himself, shall be exalted.",
    "Luke 18:15": "And they brought unto him also infants, that he might touch them. Which when the disciples saw, they rebuked them.",
    "Luke 18:16": "But Jesus, calling them together, said: Suffer children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.",

    "Luke 18:21": "Who said: All these things have I kept from my youth.",
    "Luke 18:22": "Which when Jesus had heard, he said to him: Yet one thing is wanting to thee: sell all whatever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.",
    "Luke 18:23": "He having heard these things, became sorrowful; for he was very rich.",
    "Luke 18:24": "And Jesus seeing him become sorrowful, said: How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God.",

    "Luke 19:5": "And when Jesus was come to the place, looking up, he saw him, and said to him: Zacheus, make haste and come down; for this day I must abide in thy house.",
    "Luke 19:6": "And he made haste and came down; and received him with joy.",
    "Luke 19:7": "And when all saw it, they murmured, saying, that he was gone to be a guest with a man that was a sinner.",
    "Luke 19:8": "But Zacheus standing, said to the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have wronged any man of any thing, I restore him fourfold.",
    "Luke 19:9": "Jesus said to him: This day is salvation come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.",
    "Luke 19:10": "For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.",

    "Luke 20:4": "The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?",
    "Luke 20:5": "But they thought within themselves, saying: If we shall say, From heaven: he will say: Why then did you not believe him?",
    "Luke 20:6": "But if we say, Of men, the whole people will stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.",
    "Luke 20:7": "And they answered, that they knew not whence it was.",

    "John 3:14": "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of man be lifted up:",
    "John 3:15": "That whosoever believeth in him, may not perish; but may have life everlasting.",
    "John 3:16": "For God so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son; that whosoever believeth in him, may not perish, but may have life everlasting.",
    "John 3:17": "For God sent not his Son into the world, to judge the world, but that the world may be saved by him.",
    "John 3:18": "He that believeth in him is not judged. But he that doth not believe, is already judged: because he believeth not in the name of the only begotten Son of God.",
    "John 3:19": "And this is the judgment: because the light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than the light: for their works were evil.",
    "John 3:20": "For every one that doth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, that his works may not be reproved.",

    "John 3:26": "And they came to John, and said to him: Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou gavest testimony, behold he baptizeth, and all men come to him.",
    "John 3:27": "John answered, and said: A man cannot receive any thing, unless it be given him from heaven.",
    "John 3:28": "You yourselves do bear me witness, that I said, I am not Christ, but that I am sent before him.",
    "John 3:29": "He that hath the bride, is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth with joy because of the bridegroomâ€™s voice. This my joy therefore is fulfilled.",
    "John 3:30": "He must increase, but I must decrease.",
    "John 3:31": "He that cometh from above, is above all. He that is of the earth, of the earth he is, and of the earth he speaketh. He that cometh from heaven, is above all.",
    "John 3:32": "And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth: and no man receiveth his testimony.",
    "John 3:33": "He that hath received his testimony, hath set to his seal that God is true.",
    "John 3:34": "For he whom God hath sent, speaketh the words of God: for God doth not give the Spirit by measure.",
    "John 3:35": "The Father loveth the Son: and he hath given all things into his hand.",
    "John 3:36": "He that believeth in the Son, hath life everlasting; but he that believeth not the Son, shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.",
    "John 4:1": "WHEN Jesus therefore understood that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus maketh more disciples, and baptizeth more than John,",
    "John 4:2": "(Though Jesus himself did not baptize, but his disciples,)",
    "John 4:3": "He left Judea, and went again into Galilee.",
    "John 4:4": "And he was of necessity to pass through Samaria.",
    "John 4:5": "He cometh therefore to a city of Samaria, which is called Sichar, near the land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.",
    "John 4:6": "Now Jacobâ€™s well was there. Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well. It was about the sixth hour.",
    "John 4:7": "There cometh a woman of Samaria, to draw water. Jesus saith to her: Give me to drink.",
    "John 4:8": "For his disciples were gone into the city to buy meats.",
    "John 4:9": "Then that Samaritan woman saith to him: How dost thou, being a Jew, ask of me to drink, who am a Samaritan woman? For the Jews do not communicate with the Samaritans.",
    "John 4:10": "Jesus answered, and said to her: If thou didst know the gift of God, and who he is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou perhaps wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.",
    "John 4:11": "The woman saith to him: Sir, thou hast nothing wherein to draw, and the well is deep; from whence then hast thou living water?",
    "John 4:12": "Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?",
    "John 4:13": "Jesus answered, and said to her: Whosoever drinketh of this water, shall thirst again; but he that shall drink of the water that I will give him, shall not thirst for ever:",
    "John 4:14": "But the water that I will give him, shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into life everlasting.",
    "John 4:15": "The woman saith to him: Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.",
    "John 4:16": "Jesus saith to her: Go, call thy husband, and come hither.",
    "John 4:17": "The woman answered, and said: I have no husband. Jesus said to her: Thou hast said well, I have no husband:",
    "John 4:18": "For thou hast had five husbands: and he whom thou now hast, is not thy husband. This thou hast said truly.",
    "John 4:19": "The woman saith to him: Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.",
    "John 4:20": "Our fathers adored on this mountain, and you say, that at Jerusalem is the place where men must adore.",
    "John 4:21": "Jesus saith to her: Woman, believe me, that the hour cometh, when you shall neither on this mountain, not in Jerusalem, adore the Father.",
    "John 4:22": "You adore that which you know not: we adore that which we know; for salvation is of the Jews.",
    "John 4:23": "But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true adorers shall adore the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father also seeketh such to adore him.",
    "John 4:24": "God is a spirit; and they that adore him, must adore him in spirit and in truth.",
    "John 4:25": "The woman saith to him: I know that the Messias cometh (who is called Christ); therefore, when he is come, he will tell us all things.",
    "John 4:26": "Jesus saith to her: I am he, who am speaking with thee.",
    "John 4:27": "And immediately his disciples came; and they wondered that he talked with the woman. Yet no man said: What seekest thou? or, why talkest thou with her?",
    "John 4:28": "The woman therefore left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men there:",
    "John 4:29": "Come, and see a man who has told me all things whatsoever I have done. Is not he the Christ?",
    "John 4:30": "They went therefore out of the city, and came unto him.",
    "John 4:31": "In the mean time the disciples prayed him, saying: Rabbi, eat.",
    "John 4:32": "But he said to them: I have meat to eat, which you know not.",
    "John 4:33": "The disciples therefore said one to another: Hath any man brought him to eat?",
    "John 4:34": "Jesus saith to them: My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, that I may perfect his work.",
    "John 4:35": "Do you not say, There are yet four months, and then the harvest cometh? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes, and see the countries; for they are white already to harvest.",
    "John 4:36": "And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life everlasting: that both he that soweth, and he that reapeth, may rejoice together.",
    "John 4:37": "For in this is the saying true: That it is one man that soweth, and it is another that reapeth.",
    "John 4:38": "I have sent you to reap that in which you did not labour: others have laboured, and you have entered into their labours.",
    "John 4:39": "Now of that city many of the Samaritans believed in him, for the word of the woman giving testimony: He told me all things whatsoever I have done.",
    "John 4:40": "So when the Samaritans were come to him, they desired that he would tarry there. And he abode there two days.",
    "John 4:41": "And many more believed in him because of his own word.",
    "John 4:42": "And they said to the woman: We now believe, not for thy saying: for we ourselves have heard him, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.",
    "John 4:43": "Now after two days, he departed thence, and went into Galilee.",
    "John 4:44": "For Jesus himself gave testimony that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.",
    "John 4:45": "And when he was come into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things he had done at Jerusalem on the festival day; for they also went to the festival day.",
    "John 4:46": "He came again therefore into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain ruler, whose son was sick at Capharnaum.",
    "John 4:47": "He having heard that Jesus was come from Judea into Galilee, went to him, and prayed him to come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.",
    "John 4:48": "Jesus therefore said to him: Unless you see signs and wonders, you believe not.",
    "John 4:49": "The ruler saith to him: Lord, come down before that my son die.",
    "John 4:50": "Jesus saith to him: Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and went his way.",
    "John 4:51": "And as he was going down, his servants met him; and they brought word, saying, that his son lived.",
    "John 4:52": "He asked therefore of them the hour wherein he grew better. And they said to him: Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him.",
    "John 4:53": "The father therefore knew, that it was at the same hour that Jesus said to him, Thy son liveth; and himself believed, and his whole house.",
    "John 4:54": "This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judea into Galilee.",
    "John 5:1": "AFTER these things was a festival day of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.",
    "John 5:2": "Now there is at Jerusalem a pond, called Probatica, which in Hebrew is named Bethsaida, having five porches.",
    "John 5:3": "In these lay a great multitude of sick, of blind, of lame, of withered; waiting for the moving of the water.",
    "John 5:4": "And an angel of the Lord descended at certain times into the pond; and the water was moved. And he that went down first into the pond after the motion of the water, was made whole, of whatsoever infirmity he lay under.",
    "John 5:5": "And there was a certain man there, that had been eight and thirty years under his infirmity.",
    "John 5:6": "Him when Jesus had seen lying, and knew that he had been now a long time, he saith to him: Wilt thou be made whole?",
    "John 5:7": "The infirm man answered him: Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pond. For whilst I am coming, another goeth down before me.",
    "John 5:8": "Jesus saith to him: Arise, take up thy bed, and walk.",
    "John 5:9": "And immediately the man was made whole: and he took up his bed, and walked. And it was the sabbath that day.",
    "John 5:10": "The Jews therefore said to him that was healed: It is the sabbath; it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.",
    "John 5:11": "He answered them: He that made me whole, he said to me, Take up thy bed, and walk.",
    "John 5:12": "They asked him therefore: Who is that man who said to thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?",
    "John 5:13": "But he who was healed, knew not who it was; for Jesus went aside from the multitude standing in the place.",
    "John 5:14": "Afterwards, Jesus findeth him in the temple, and saith to him: Behold thou art made whole: sin no more, lest some worse thing happen to thee.",
    "John 5:15": "The man went his way, and told the Jews, that it was Jesus who had made him whole.",
    "John 5:16": "Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.",
    "John 5:17": "But Jesus answered them: My Father worketh until now; and I work.",
    "John 5:18": "Hereupon therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he did not only break the sabbath, but also said God was his Father, making himself equal to God.",
    "John 5:19": "Then Jesus answered, and said to them: Amen, amen, I say unto you, the Son cannot do any thing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing: for what things soever he doth, these the Son also doth in like manner.",
    "John 5:20": "For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things which himself doth: and greater works than these will he shew him, that you may wonder.",
    "John 5:21": "For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and giveth life: so the Son also giveth life to whom he will.",
    "John 5:22": "For neither doth the Father judge any man, but hath given all judgment to the Son.",
    "John 5:23": "That all men may honour the Son, as they honour the Father. He who honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father, who hath sent him.",
    "John 5:24": "Amen, amen I say unto you, that he who heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath life everlasting; and cometh not into judgment, but is passed from death to life.",
    "John 5:25": "Amen, amen I say unto you, that the hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.",
    "John 5:26": "For as the Father hath life in himself, so he hath given the Son also to have life in himself:",
    "John 5:27": "And he hath given him power to do judgment, because he is the Son of man.",
    "John 5:28": "Wonder not at this; for the hour cometh, wherein all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God.",
    "John 5:29": "And they that have done good things, shall come forth unto the resurrection of life; but they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.",
    "John 5:30": "I cannot of myself do any thing. As I hear, so I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of him that sent me.",
    "John 5:31": "If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.",
    "John 5:32": "There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.",
    "John 5:33": "You sent to John, and he gave testimony to the truth.",
    "John 5:34": "But I receive not testimony from man: but I say these things, that you may be saved.",

    "John 9:13": "They bring him that had been blind to the Pharisees.",
    "John 9:14": "Now it was the sabbath, when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.",
    "John 9:15": "Again therefore the Pharisees asked him, how he had received his sight. But he said to them: He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and I see.",
    "John 9:16": "Some therefore of the Pharisees said: This man is not of God, who keepeth not the sabbath. But others said: How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.",
    "John 9:17": "They say therefore to the blind man again: What sayest thou of him that hath opened they eyes? And he said: He is a prophet.",
    "John 9:18": "The Jews then did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,",
    "John 9:19": "And asked them, saying: Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then doth he now see?",
    "John 9:20": "His parents answered them, and said: We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:",
    "John 9:21": "But how he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: ask himself: he is of age, let him speak for himself.",
    "John 9:22": "These things his parents said, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had already agreed among themselves, that if any man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.",
    "John 9:23": "Therefore did his parents say: He is of age, ask himself.",
    "John 9:24": "They therefore called the man again that had been blind, and said to him: Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.",
    "John 9:25": "He said therefore to them: If he be a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see.",
    "John 9:26": "They said then to him: What did he to thee? How did he open thy eyes?",
    "John 9:27": "He answered them: I have told you already, and you have heard: why would you hear it again? will you also become his disciples?",
    "John 9:28": "They reviled him therefore, and said: Be thou his disciple; but we are the disciples of Moses.",
    "John 9:29": "We know that God spoke to Moses: but as to this man, we know not from whence he is.",
    "John 9:30": "The man answered, and said to them: Why, herein is a wonderful thing, that you know not from whence he is, and he hath opened my eyes.",
    "John 9:31": "Now we know that God doth not hear sinners: but if a man be a server of God, and doth his will, him he heareth.",
    "John 9:32": "From the beginning of the world it hath not been heard, that any man hath opened the eyes of one born blind.",
    "John 9:33": "Unless this man were of God, he could not do any thing.",
    "John 9:34": "They answered, and said to him: Thou wast wholly born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.",
    "John 9:35": "Jesus heard that they had cast him out: and when he had found him, he said to him: Dost thou believe in the Son of God?",
    "John 9:36": "He answered, and said: Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?",
    "John 9:37": "And Jesus said to him: Thou hast both seen him; and it is he that talketh with thee.",
    "John 9:38": "And he said: I believe, Lord. And falling down, he adored him.",
    "John 9:39": "And Jesus said: For judgment I am come into this world; that they who see not, may see; and they who see, may become blind.",
    "John 9:40": "And some of the Pharisees, who were with him, heard: and they said unto him: Are we also blind?",
    "John 9:41": "Jesus said to them: If you were blind, you should not have sin: but now you say: We see. Your sin remaineth.",
    "John 10:1": "AMEN, amen I say to you: He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up another way, the same is a thief and a robber.",
    "John 10:2": "But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.",
    "John 10:3": "To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.",
    "John 10:4": "And when he hath let out his own sheep, he goeth before them: and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.",
    "John 10:5": "But a stranger they follow not, but fly from him, because they know not the voice of strangers.",
    "John 10:6": "This proverb Jesus spoke to them. But they understood not what he spoke to them.",
    "John 10:7": "Jesus therefore said to them again: Amen, amen I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.",
    "John 10:8": "All others, as many as have come, are thieves and robbers: and the sheep heard them not.",
    "John 10:9": "I am the door. By me, if any man enter in, he shall be saved: and he shall go in, and go out, and shall find pastures.",
    "John 10:10": "The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I am come that they may have life, and may have it more abundantly.",
    "John 10:11": "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd giveth his life for his sheep.",
    "John 10:12": "But the hireling, and he that is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and flieth: and the wolf catcheth, and scattereth the sheep:",
    "John 10:13": "And the hireling flieth, because he is a hireling: and he hath no care for the sheep.",
    "John 10:14": "I am the good shepherd; and I know mine, and mine know me.",
    "John 10:15": "As the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father: and I lay down my life for my sheep.",
    "John 10:16": "And other sheep I have, that are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice, and there shall be one fold and one shepherd.",
    "John 10:17": "Therefore doth the Father love me: because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.",
    "John 10:18": "No man taketh it away from me: but I lay it down of myself, and I have power to lay it down: and I have power to take it up again. This commandment have I received of my Father.",
    "John 10:19": "A dissension rose again among the Jews for these words.",
    "John 10:20": "And many of them said: He hath a devil, and is mad: why hear you him?",
    "John 10:21": "Others said: These are not the words of one that hath a devil: Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?",
    "John 10:22": "And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem: and it was winter.",
    "John 10:23": "And Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomonâ€™s porch.",
    "John 10:24": "The Jews therefore came round about him, and said to him: How long dost thou hold our souls in suspense? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.",
    "John 10:25": "Jesus answered them: I speak to you, and you believe not: the works that I do in the name of my Father, they give testimony of me.",
    "John 10:26": "But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep.",
    "John 10:27": "My sheep hear my voice: and I know them, and they follow me.",
    "John 10:28": "And I give them life everlasting; and they shall not perish for ever, and no man shall pluck them out of my hand.",
    "John 10:29": "That which my Father hath given me, is greater than all: and no one can snatch them out of the hand of my Father.",
    "John 10:30": "I and the Father are one.",
    "John 10:31": "The Jews then took up stones to stone him.",
    "John 10:32": "Jesus answered them: Many good works I have shewed you from my Father; for which of these works do you stone me?",
    "John 10:33": "The Jews answered him: For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, maketh thyself God.",
    "John 10:34": "Jesus answered them: Is it not written in your law: I said you are gods?",
    "John 10:35": "If he called them gods, to whom to word of God was spoken, and the scripture cannot be broken;",
    "John 10:36": "Do you say of him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world: Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God?",
    "John 10:37": "If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.",
    "John 10:38": "But if I do, though you will not believe me, believe the works: that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.",
    "John 10:39": "They sought therefore to take him; and he escaped out of their hands.",
    "John 10:40": "And he went again beyond the Jordan, into that place where John was baptizing first; and there he abode.",
    "John 10:41": "And many resorted to him, and they said: John indeed did no sign.",
    "John 10:42": "But all things whatsoever John said of this man, were true. And many believed in him.",
    "John 11:1": "NOW there was a certain man sick, named Lazarus, of Bethania, of the town of Mary and Martha her sister.",
    "John 11:2": "(And Mary was she that anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair: whose brother Lazarus was sick.)",
    "John 11:3": "His sisters therefore sent to him, saying: Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.",
    "John 11:4": "And Jesus hearing it, said to them: This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God: that the Son of God may be glorified by it.",
    "John 11:5": "Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister Mary, and Lazarus.",
    "John 11:6": "When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he still remained in the same place two days.",
    "John 11:7": "Then after that, he said to his disciples: Let us go into Judea again.",
    "John 11:8": "The disciples say to him: Rabbi, the Jews but now sought to stone thee: and goest thou thither again?",
    "John 11:9": "Jesus answered: Are there not twelve hours of the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world:",
    "John 11:10": "But if he walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.",
    "John 11:11": "These things he said; and after that he said to them: Lazarus our friend sleepeth; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.",
    "John 11:12": "His disciples therefore said: Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.",
    "John 11:13": "But Jesus spoke of his death; and they thought that he spoke of the repose of sleep.",
    "John 11:14": "Then therefore Jesus said to them plainly: Lazarus is dead.",
    "John 11:15": "And I am glad, for your sakes, that I was not there, that you may believe: but let us go to him.",
    "John 11:16": "Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples: Let us also go, that we may die with him.",
    "John 11:17": "Jesus therefore came, and found that he had been four days already in the grave.",
    "John 11:18": "(Now Bethania was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off.)",
    "John 11:19": "And many of the Jews were come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.",
    "John 11:20": "Martha therefore, as soon as she heard that Jesus had come, went to meet him: but Mary sat at home.",
    "John 11:21": "Martha therefore said to Jesus: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.",
    "John 11:22": "But now also I know that whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.",
    "John 11:23": "Jesus saith to her: Thy brother shall rise again.",
    "John 11:24": "Martha saith to him: I know that he shall rise again, in the resurrection at the last day.",
    "John 11:25": "Jesus said to her: I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, although he be dead, shall live:",
    "John 11:26": "And every one that liveth, and believeth in me, shall not die for ever. Believest thou this?",
    "John 11:27": "She saith to him: Yea, Lord, I have believed that thou art Christ the Son of the living God, who art come into this world.",
    "John 11:28": "And when she had said these things, she went, and called her sister Mary secretly, saying: The master is come, and calleth for thee.",
    "John 11:29": "She, as soon as she heard this, riseth quickly, and cometh to him.",
    "John 11:30": "For Jesus was not yet come into the town: but he was still in that place where Martha had met him.",
    "John 11:31": "The Jews therefore, who were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary that she rose up speedily and went out, followed her, saying: She goeth to the grave to weep there.",
    "John 11:32": "When Mary therefore was come where Jesus was, seeing him, she fell down at his feet, and saith to him: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.",
    "John 11:33": "Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews that were come with her, weeping, groaned in the spirit, and troubled himself,",
    "John 11:34": "And said: Where have you laid him? They say to him: Lord, come and see.",
    "John 11:35": "And Jesus wept.",
    "John 11:36": "The Jews therefore said: Behold how he loved him.",

    "John 11:39": "Jesus saith: Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith to him: Lord, by this time he stinketh, for he is now of four days.",
    "John 11:40": "Jesus saith to her: Did not I say to thee, that if thou believe, thou shalt see the glory of God?",
    "John 11:41": "They took therefore the stone away. And Jesus lifting up his eyes said: Father, I give thee thanks that thou hast heard me.",
    "John 11:42": "And I knew that thou hearest me always; but because of the people who stand about have I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.",
    "John 11:43": "When he had said these things, he cried with a loud voice: Lazarus, come forth.",
    "John 11:44": "And presently he that had been dead came forth, bound feet and hands with winding bands; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus said to them: Loose him, and let him go.",
    "John 11:45": "Many therefore of the Jews, who were come to Mary and Martha, and had seen the things that Jesus did, believed in him.",
    "John 11:46": "But some of them went to the Pharisees, and told them the things that Jesus had done.",
    "John 11:47": "The chief priests therefore, and the Pharisees, gathered a council, and said: What do we, for this man doth many miracles?",
    "John 11:48": "If we let him alone so, all will believe in him; and the Romans will come, and take away our place and nation.",
    "John 11:49": "But one of them, named Caiphas, being the high priest that year, said to them: You know nothing.",
    "John 11:50": "Neither do you consider that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.",
    "John 11:51": "And this he spoke not of himself: but being the high priest of that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation.",
    "John 11:52": "And not only for the nation, but to gather together in one the children of God, that were dispersed.",
    "John 11:53": "From that day therefore they devised to put him to death.",
    "John 11:54": "Wherefore Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews; but he went into a country near the desert, unto a city that is called Ephrem, and there he abode with his disciples.",
    "John 11:55": "And the pasch of the Jews was at hand; and many from the country went up to Jerusalem, before the pasch to purify themselves.",
    "John 11:56": "They sought therefore for Jesus; and they discoursed one with another, standing in the temple: What think you that he is not come to the festival day?",
    "John 11:57": "And the chief priests and Pharisees had given a commandment, that if any man knew where he was, he should tell, that they might apprehend him.",
    "John 12:1": "JESUS therefore, six days before the pasch, came to Bethania, where Lazarus had been dead, whom Jesus raised to life.",
    "John 12:2": "And they made him a supper there: and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that were at table with him.",
    "John 12:3": "Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of right spikenard, of great price, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.",
    "John 12:4": "Then one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, he that was about to betray him, said:",
    "John 12:5": "Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?",
    "John 12:6": "Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the purse, carried the things that were put therein.",
    "John 12:7": "Jesus therefore said: Let her alone, that she may keep it against the day of my burial.",
    "John 12:8": "For the poor you have always with you; but me you have not always.",
    "John 12:9": "A great multitude therefore of the Jews knew that he was there; and they came, not for Jesusâ€™ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.",
    "John 12:10": "But the chief priests thought to kill Lazarus also:",
    "John 12:11": "Because many of the Jews, by reason of him, went away, and believed in Jesus.",
    "John 12:12": "And on the next day, a great multitude that was to come to the festival day, when they had heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,",
    "John 12:13": "Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried: Hosanna, blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, the king of Israel.",
    "John 12:14": "And Jesus found a young ass, and sat upon it, as it is written:",
    "John 12:15": "Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy king cometh, sitting on an assâ€™s colt.",
    "John 12:16": "These things his disciples did not know at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him.",
    "John 12:17": "The multitude therefore gave testimony, which was with him, when he called Lazarus out of the grave, and raised him from the dead.",
    "John 12:18": "For which reason also the people came to meet him, because they heard that he had done this miracle.",
    "John 12:19": "The Pharisees therefore said among themselves: Do you see that we prevail nothing? behold, the whole world is gone after him.",
    "John 12:20": "Now there were certain Gentiles among them, who came up to adore on the festival day.",
    "John 12:21": "These therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying: Sir, we would see Jesus.",
    "John 12:22": "Philip cometh, and telleth Andrew. Again Andrew and Philip told Jesus.",
    "John 12:23": "But Jesus answered them, saying: The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.",
    "John 12:24": "Amen, amen I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground die,",
    "John 12:25": "Itself remaineth alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world, keepeth it unto life eternal.",
    "John 12:26": "If any man minister to me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall my minister be. If any man minister to me, him will my Father honour.",
    "John 12:27": "Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause I came unto this hour.",
    "John 12:28": "Father, glorify thy name. A voice therefore came from heaven: I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.",
    "John 12:29": "The multitude therefore that stood and heard, said that it thundered. Others said: An angel spoke to him.",
    "John 12:30": "Jesus answered, and said: This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.",
    "John 12:31": "Now is the judgment of the world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.",
    "John 12:32": "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all things to myself.",
    "John 12:33": "(Now this he said, signifying what death he should die.)",
    "John 12:34": "The multitude answered him: We have heard out of the law, that Christ abideth for ever; and how sayest thou: The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?",
    "John 12:35": "Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a little while, the light is among you. Walk whilst you have the light, that the darkness overtake you not. And he that walketh in darkness, knoweth not whither he goeth.",
    "John 12:36": "Whilst you have the light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light. These things Jesus spoke; and he went away, and hid himself from them.",
    "John 12:37": "And whereas he had done so many miracles before them, they believed not in him:",
    "John 12:38": "That the saying of Isaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he said: Lord, who hath believed our hearing? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?",
    "John 12:39": "Therefore they could not believe, because Isaias said again:",
    "John 12:40": "He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.",
    "John 12:41": "These things said Isaias, when he saw his glory, and spoke of him.",
    "John 12:42": "However, many of the chief men also believed in him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, that they might not be cast out of the synagogue.",
    "John 12:43": "For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.",
    "John 12:44": "But Jesus cried, and said: He that believeth in me, doth not believe in me, but in him that sent me.",
    "John 12:45": "And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.",
    "John 12:46": "I am come a light into the world; that whosoever believeth in me, may not remain in darkness.",
    "John 12:47": "And if any man hear my words, and keep them not, I do not judge him: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.",
    "John 12:48": "He that despiseth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him; the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.",
    "John 12:49": "For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father who sent me, he gave me commandment what I should say, and what I should speak.",
    "John 12:50": "And I know that his commandment is life everlasting. The things therefore that I speak, even as the Father said unto me, so do I speak.",
    "John 13:1": "BEFORE the festival day of the pasch, Jesus knowing that his hour was come, that he should pass out of this world to the Father: having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them unto the end.",
    "John 13:2": "And when supper was done, (the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray him,)",
    "John 13:3": "Knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he came from God, and goeth to God;",
    "John 13:4": "He riseth from supper, and layeth aside his garments, and having taken a towel, girded himself.",

    "John 13:9": "Simon Peter saith to him: Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head.",
    "John 13:10": "Jesus saith to him: He that is washed, needeth not but to wash his feet, but is clean wholly. And you are clean, but not all.",
    "John 13:11": "For he knew who he was that would betray him; therefore he said: You are not all clean.",
    "John 13:12": "Then after he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, being set down again, he said to them: Know you what I have done to you?",
    "John 13:13": "You call me Master, and Lord; and you say well, for so I am.",
    "John 13:14": "If then I being your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; you also ought to wash one anotherâ€™s feet.",
    "John 13:15": "For I have given you an example, that as I have done to you, so you do also.",
    "John 13:16": "Amen, amen I say to you: The servant is not greater than his lord; neither is the apostle greater than he that sent him.",

    "John 13:22": "The disciples therefore looked one upon another, doubting of whom he spoke.",
    "John 13:23": "Now there was leaning on Jesusâ€™ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.",
    "John 13:24": "Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, and said to him: Who is it of whom he speaketh?",

    "John 16:23": "And in that day you shall not ask me any thing. Amen, amen I say to you: if you ask the Father any thing in my name, he will give it you.",
    "John 16:24": "Hitherto you have not asked any thing in my name. Ask, and you shall receive; that your joy may be full.",
    "John 16:25": "These things I have spoken to you in proverbs. The hour cometh, when I will no more speak to you in proverbs, but will shew you plainly of the Father.",
    "John 16:26": "In that day you shall ask in my name; and I say not to you, that I will ask the Father for you:",
    "John 16:27": "For the Father himself loveth you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.",

    "John 16:29": "His disciples say to him: Behold, now thou speakest plainly, and speakest no proverb.",
    "John 16:30": "Now we know that thou knowest all things, and thou needest not that any man should ask thee. By this we believe that thou camest forth from God.",
    "John 16:31": "Jesus answered them: Do you now believe?",
    "John 16:32": "Behold, the hour cometh, and it is now come, that you shall be scattered every man to his own, and shall leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.",
    "John 16:33": "These things I have spoken to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you shall have distress: but have confidence, I have overcome the world.",
    "John 17:1": "THESE things Jesus spoke, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said: Father, the hour is come, glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee.",
    "John 17:2": "As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he may give eternal life to all whom thou hast given him.",
    "John 17:3": "Now this is eternal life: That they may know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.",
    "John 17:4": "I have glorified thee on the earth; I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.",
    "John 17:5": "And now glorify thou me, O Father, with thyself, with the glory which I had, before the world was, with thee.",
    "John 17:6": "I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou hast given me out of the world. Thine they were, and to me thou gavest them; and they have kept thy word.",
    "John 17:7": "Now they have known, that all things which thou hast given me, are from thee:",
    "John 17:8": "Because the words which thou gavest me, I have given to them; and they have received them, and have known in very deed that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.",
    "John 17:9": "I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou hast given me: because they are thine:",
    "John 17:10": "And all my things are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.",
    "John 17:11": "And now I am not in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name whom thou has given me; that they may be one, as we also are.",
    "John 17:12": "While I was with them, I kept them in thy name. Those whom thou gavest me have I kept; and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition, that the scripture may be fulfilled.",
    "John 17:13": "And now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy filled in themselves.",
    "John 17:14": "I have given them thy word, and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world; as I also am not of the world.",
    "John 17:15": "I pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world, but that thou shouldst keep them from evil.",
    "John 17:16": "They are not of the world, as I also am not of the world.",
    "John 17:17": "Sanctify them in truth. Thy word is truth.",
    "John 17:18": "As thou hast sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.",
    "John 17:19": "And for them do I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth.",
    "John 17:20": "And not for them only do I pray, but for them also who through their word shall believe in me;",
    "John 17:21": "That they all may be one, as thou, Father, in me, and I in thee; that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.",
    "John 17:22": "And the glory which thou hast given me, I have given to them; that they may be one, as we also are one:",
    "John 17:23": "I in them, and thou in me; that they may be made perfect in one: and the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast also loved me.",
    "John 17:24": "Father, I will that where I am, they also whom thou hast given me may be with me; that they may see my glory which thou hast given me, because thou hast loved me before the creation of the world.",
    "John 17:25": "Just Father, the world hath not known thee; but I have known thee: and these have known that thou hast sent me.",
    "John 17:26": "And I have made known thy name to them, and will make it known; that the love wherewith thou hast loved me, may be in them, and I in them.",

    "John 18:2": "And Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place; because Jesus had often resorted thither together with his disciples.",
    "John 18:3": "Judas therefore having received a band of soldiers and servants from the chief priests and the Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.",
    "John 18:4": "Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said to them: Whom seek ye?",
    "John 18:5": "They answered him: Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith to them: I am he. And Judas also, who betrayed him, stood with them.",
    "John 18:6": "As soon therefore as he had said to them: I am he; they went backward, and fell to the ground.",
    "John 18:7": "Again therefore he asked them: Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.",
    "John 18:8": "Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he. If therefore you seek me, let these go their way.",
    "John 18:9": "That the word might be fulfilled which he said: Of them whom thou hast given me, I have not lost any one.",
    "John 18:10": "Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. And the name of the servant was Malchus.",
    "John 18:11": "Jesus therefore said to Peter: Put up thy sword into the scabbard. The chalice which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?",
    "John 18:12": "Then the band and the tribune, and the servants of the Jews, took Jesus, and bound him:",
    "John 18:13": "And they led him away to Annas first, for he was father in law to Caiphas, who was the high priest of that year.",
    "John 18:14": "Now Caiphas was he who had given the counsel to the Jews: That it was expedient that one man should die for the people.",
    "John 18:15": "And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. And that disciple was known to the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the court of the high priest.",
    "John 18:16": "But Peter stood at the door without. The other disciple therefore, who was known to the high priest, went out, and spoke to the portress, and brought in Peter.",
    "John 18:17": "The maid therefore that was portress, saith to Peter: Art not thou also one of this manâ€™s disciples? He saith: I am not.",
    "John 18:18": "Now the servants and ministers stood at a fire of coals, because it was cold, and warmed themselves. And with them was Peter also, standing, and warming himself.",
    "John 18:19": "The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.",
    "John 18:20": "Jesus answered him: I have spoken openly to the world: I have always taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither all the Jews resort; and in secret I have spoken nothing.",
    "John 18:21": "Why asketh thou me? ask them who have heard what I have spoken unto them: behold they know what things I have said.",
    "John 18:22": "And when he had said these things, one of the servants standing by, gave Jesus a blow, saying: Answerest thou the high priest so?",
    "John 18:23": "Jesus answered him: If I have spoken evil, give testimony of the evil; but if well, why strikest thou me?",
    "John 18:24": "And Annas sent him bound to Caiphas the high priest.",
    "John 18:25": "And Simon Peter was standing, and warming himself. They said therefore to him: Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said: I am not.",
    "John 18:26": "One of the servants of the high priest (a kinsman to him whose ear Peter cut off) saith to him: Did I not see thee in the garden with him?",
    "John 18:27": "Again therefore Peter denied; and immediately the cock crew.",
    "John 18:28": "Then they led Jesus from Caiphas to the governorâ€™s hall. And it was morning; and they went not into the hall, that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the pasch.",
    "John 18:29": "Pilate therefore went out to them, and said: What accusation bring you against this man?",
    "John 18:30": "They answered, and said to him: If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up to thee.",
    "John 18:31": "Pilate therefore said to them: Take him you, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him: It is not lawful for us to put any man to death;",
    "John 18:32": "That the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he said, signifying what death he should die.",
    "John 18:33": "Pilate therefore went into the hall again, and called Jesus, and said to him: Art thou the king of the Jews?",
    "John 18:34": "Jesus answered: Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or have others told it thee of me?",
    "John 18:35": "Pilate answered: Am I a Jew? Thy own nation, and the chief priests, have delivered thee up to me: what hast thou done?",
    "John 18:36": "Jesus answered: My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would certainly strive that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now my kingdom is not from hence.",
    "John 18:37": "Pilate therefore said to him: Art thou a king then? Jesus answered: Thou sayest that I am a king. For this was I born, and for this came I into the world; that I should give testimony to the truth. Every one that is of the truth, heareth my voice.",
    "John 18:38": "Pilate saith to him: What is truth? And when he said this, he went out again to the Jews, and saith to them: I find no cause in him.",
    "John 18:39": "But you have a custom that I should release one unto you at the pasch: will you, therefore, that I release unto you the king of the Jews?",
    "John 18:40": "Then cried they all again, saying: Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.",
    "John 19:1": "THEN therefore, Pilate took Jesus, and scourged him.",
    "John 19:2": "And the soldiers platting a crown of thorns, put it upon his head; and they put on him a purple garment.",
    "John 19:3": "And they came to him, and said: Hail, king of the Jews; and they gave him blows.",
    "John 19:4": "Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith to them: Behold, I bring him forth unto you, that you may know that I find no cause in him.",
    "John 19:5": "(Jesus therefore came forth, bearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment.) And he saith to them: Behold the Man.",
    "John 19:6": "When the chief priests, therefore, and the servants, had seen him, they cried out, saying: Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith to them: Take him you, and crucify him: for I find no cause in him.",
    "John 19:7": "The Jews answered him: We have a law; and according to the law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.",
    "John 19:8": "When Pilate therefore had heard this saying, he feared the more.",
    "John 19:9": "And he entered into the hall again, and he said to Jesus: Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.",
    "John 19:10": "Pilate therefore saith to him: Speakest thou not to me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and I have power to release thee?",
    "John 19:11": "Jesus answered: Thou shouldst not have any power against me, unless it were given thee from above. Therefore, he that hath delivered me to thee, hath the greater sin.",
    "John 19:12": "And from henceforth Pilate sought to release him. But the Jews cried out, saying: If thou release this man, thou art not Caesarâ€™s friend. For whosoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against Caesar.",
    "John 19:13": "Now when Pilate had heard these words, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat, in the place that is called Lithostrotos, and in Hebrew Gabbatha.",
    "John 19:14": "And it was the parasceve of the pasch, about the sixth hour, and he saith to the Jews: Behold your king.",
    "John 19:15": "But they cried out: Away with him; away with him; crucify him. Pilate saith to them: Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered: We have no king but Caesar.",

    "Romans 2:1": "WHEREFORE thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest. For wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself. For thou dost the same things which thou judgest.",
    "Romans 2:2": "For we know that the judgment of God is, according to truth, against them that do such things.",
    "Romans 2:3": "And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them who do such things, and dost the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?",
    "Romans 2:4": "Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and patience, and longsuffering? Knowest thou not, that the benignity of God leadeth thee to penance?",

    "Romans 2:18": "And knowest his will, and approvest the more profitable things, being instructed by the law,",
    "Romans 2:19": "Art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness,",

    "Romans 2:27": "And shall not that which by nature is uncircumcision, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law?",
    "Romans 2:28": "For it is not he is a Jew, who is so outwardly; nor is that circumcision which is outwardly in the flesh:",
    "Romans 2:29": "But he is a Jew, that is one inwardly; and the circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.",

    "Romans 3:8": "And not rather (as we are slandered, and as some affirm that we say) let us do evil, that there may come good? whose damnation is just.",
    "Romans 3:9": "What then? Do we excel them? No, not so. For we have charged both Jews, and Greeks, that they are all under sin.",
    "Romans 3:10": "As it is written: There is not any man just.",
    "Romans 3:11": "There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.",

    "Romans 3:26": "Through the forbearance of God, for the shewing of his justice in this time; that he himself may be just, and the justifier of him, who is of the faith of Jesus Christ.",
    "Romans 3:27": "Where is then thy boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith.",

    "Romans 4:8": "Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin.",
    "Romans 4:9": "This blessedness then, doth it remain in the circumcision only, or in the uncircumcision also? For we say that unto Abraham faith was reputed to justice.",
    "Romans 4:10": "How then was it reputed? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.",
    "Romans 4:11": "And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the justice of the faith, which he had, being uncircumcised; that he might be the father of all them that believe, being uncircumcised, that unto them also it may be reputed to justice:",
    "Romans 4:12": "And might be the father of circumcision; not to them only, that are of the circumcision, but to them also that follow the steps of the faithful, that is in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham.",
    "Romans 4:13": "For not through the law was the promise to Abraham, or to his seed, that he should be heir of the world; but through the justice of faith.",
    "Romans 4:14": "For if they who are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, the promise is made of no effect.",
    "Romans 4:15": "For the law worketh wrath. For where there is no law, neither is there transgression.",
    "Romans 4:16": "Therefore is it of faith, that according to grace the promise might be firm to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,",
    "Romans 4:17": "(As it is written: I have made thee a father of many nations,) before God, whom he believed, who quickeneth the dead; and calleth those things that are not, as those that are.",

    "Romans 4:19": "And he was not weak in faith; neither did he consider his own body now dead, whereas he was almost an hundred years old, nor the dead womb of Sara.",
    "Romans 4:20": "In the promise also of God he staggered not by distrust; but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God:",
    "Romans 4:21": "Most fully knowing, that whatsoever he has promised, he is able also to perform.",
    "Romans 4:22": "And therefore it was reputed to him unto justice.",
    "Romans 4:23": "Now it is not written only for him, that it was reputed to him unto justice,",
    "Romans 4:24": "But also for us, to whom it shall be reputed, if we believe in him, that raised up Jesus Christ, our Lord, from the dead,",
    "Romans 4:25": "Who was delivered up for our sins, and rose again for our justification.",
    "Romans 5:1": "BEING justified therefore by faith, let us have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ:",
    "Romans 5:2": "By whom also we have access through faith into this grace, wherein we stand, and glory in the hope of the glory of the sons of God.",
    "Romans 5:3": "And not only so; but we glory also in tribulations, knowing that tribulation worketh patience;",
    "Romans 5:4": "And patience trial; and trial hope;",
    "Romans 5:5": "And hope confoundeth not: because the charity of God is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost, who is given to us.",
    "Romans 5:6": "For why did Christ, when as yet we were weak, according to the time, die for the ungodly?",
    "Romans 5:7": "For scarce for a just man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man some one would dare to die.",
    "Romans 5:8": "But God commendeth his charity towards us; because when as yet we were sinners, according to the time,",
    "Romans 5:9": "Christ died for us; much more therefore, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from wrath through him.",
    "Romans 5:10": "For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son; much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.",
    "Romans 5:11": "And not only so; but also we glory in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received reconciliation.",
    "Romans 5:12": "Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world, and by sin death; and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned.",
    "Romans 5:13": "For until the law sin was in the world; but sin was not imputed, when the law was not.",
    "Romans 5:14": "But death reigned from Adam unto Moses, even over them also who have not sinned after the similitude of the transgression of Adam, who is a figure of him who was to come.",
    "Romans 5:15": "But not as the offence, so also the gift. For if by the offence of one, many died; much more the grace of God, and the gift, by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.",
    "Romans 5:16": "And not as it was by one sin, so also is the gift. For judgment indeed was by one unto condemnation; but grace is of many offences, unto justification.",
    "Romans 5:17": "For if by one manâ€™s offence death reigned through one; much more they who receive abundance of grace, and of the gift, and of justice, shall reign in life through one, Jesus Christ.",
    "Romans 5:18": "Therefore, as by the offence of one, unto all men to condemnation; so also by the justice of one, unto all men to justification of life.",
    "Romans 5:19": "For as by the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners; so also by the obedience of one, many shall be made just.",
    "Romans 5:20": "Now the law entered in, that sin might abound. And where sin abounded, grace did more abound.",
    "Romans 5:21": "That as sin hath reigned to death; so also grace might reign by justice unto life everlasting, through Jesus Christ our Lord.",
    "Romans 6:1": "WHAT shall we say, then? shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?",
    "Romans 6:2": "God forbid. For we that are dead to sin, how shall we live any longer therein?",
    "Romans 6:3": "Know you not that all we, who are baptized in Christ Jesus, are baptized in his death?",
    "Romans 6:4": "For we are buried together with him by baptism into death; that as Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also may walk in newness of life.",
    "Romans 6:5": "For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection.",
    "Romans 6:6": "Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin may be destroyed, to the end that we may serve sin no longer.",
    "Romans 6:7": "For he that is dead is justified from sin.",
    "Romans 6:8": "Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall live also together with Christ:",
    "Romans 6:9": "Knowing that Christ rising again from the dead, dieth now no more, death shall no more have dominion over him.",
    "Romans 6:10": "For in that he died to sin, he died once; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God:",
    "Romans 6:11": "So do you also reckon, that you are dead to sin, but alive unto God, in Christ Jesus our Lord.",
    "Romans 6:12": "Let no sin therefore reign in your mortal body, so as to obey the lusts thereof.",
    "Romans 6:13": "Neither yield ye your members as instruments of iniquity unto sin; but present yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of justice unto God.",
    "Romans 6:14": "For sin shall not have dominion over you; for you are not under the law, but under grace.",
    "Romans 6:15": "What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.",
    "Romans 6:16": "Know you not, that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are whom you obey, whether it be of sin unto death, or of obedience unto justice.",
    "Romans 6:17": "But thanks be to God, that you were the servants of sin, but have obeyed from the heart, unto that form of doctrine, into which you have been delivered.",
    "Romans 6:18": "Being then freed from sin, we have been made servants of justice.",
    "Romans 6:19": "I speak an human thing, because of the infirmity of your flesh. For as you have yielded your members to serve uncleanness and iniquity, unto iniquity; so now yield your members to serve justice, unto sanctification.",
    "Romans 6:20": "For when you were the servants of sin, you were free men to justice.",
    "Romans 6:21": "What fruit therefore had you then in those things, of which you are now ashamed? For the end of them is death.",
    "Romans 6:22": "But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end life everlasting.",
    "Romans 6:23": "For the wages of sin is death. But the grace of God, life everlasting, in Christ Jesus our Lord.",
    "Romans 7:1": "KNOW you not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) that the law hath dominion over a man, as long as it liveth?",
    "Romans 7:2": "For the woman that hath an husband, whilst her husband liveth is bound to the law. But if her husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.",
    "Romans 7:3": "Therefore, whilst her husband liveth, she shall be called an adulteress, if she be with another man: but if her husband be dead, she is delivered from the law of her husband; so that she is not an adulteress, if she be with another man.",
    "Romans 7:4": "Therefore, my brethren, you also are become dead to the law, by the body of Christ; that you may belong to another, who is risen again from the dead, that we may bring forth fruit to God.",
    "Romans 7:5": "For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members, to bring forth fruit unto death.",
    "Romans 7:6": "But now we are loosed from the law of death, wherein we were detained; so that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.",
    "Romans 7:7": "What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? God forbid. But I do not know sin, but by the law; for I had not known concupiscence, if the law did not say: Thou shalt not covet.",
    "Romans 7:8": "But sin taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.",
    "Romans 7:9": "And I lived some time without the law. But when the commandment came, sin revived,",
    "Romans 7:10": "And I died. And the commandment that was ordained to life, the same was found to be unto death to me.",
    "Romans 7:11": "For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, seduced me, and by it killed me.",
    "Romans 7:12": "Wherefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.",
    "Romans 7:13": "Was that then which is good, made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it may appear sin, by that which is good, wrought death in me; that sin, by the commandment, might become sinful above measure.",
    "Romans 7:14": "For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin.",
    "Romans 7:15": "For that which I work, I understand not. For I do not that good which I will; but the evil which I hate, that I do.",
    "Romans 7:16": "If then I do that which I will not, I consent to the law, that it is good.",
    "Romans 7:17": "Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.",
    "Romans 7:18": "For I know that there dwelleth not in me, that is to say, in my flesh, that which is good. For to will, is present with me; but to accomplish that which is good, I find not.",
    "Romans 7:19": "For the good which I will, I do not; but the evil which I will not, that I do.",
    "Romans 7:20": "Now if I do that which I will not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.",
    "Romans 7:21": "I find then a law, that when I have a will to do good, evil is present with me.",
    "Romans 7:22": "For I am delighted with the law of God, according to the inward man:",
    "Romans 7:23": "But I see another law in my members, fighting against the law of my mind, and captivating me in the law of sin, that is in my members.",
    "Romans 7:24": "Unhappy man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?",
    "Romans 7:25": "The grace of God, by Jesus Christ our Lord. Therefore, I myself, with the mind serve the law of God; but with the flesh, the law of sin.",
    "Romans 8:1": "THERE is now therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not according to the flesh.",
    "Romans 8:2": "For the law of the spirit of life, in Christ Jesus, hath delivered me from the law of sin and of death.",
    "Romans 8:3": "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh; God sending his own Son, in the likeness of sinful flesh and of sin, hath condemned sin in the flesh;",
    "Romans 8:4": "That the justification of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit.",
    "Romans 8:5": "For they that are according to the flesh, mind the things that are of the flesh; but they that are according to the spirit, mind the things that are of the spirit.",
    "Romans 8:6": "For the wisdom of the flesh is death; but the wisdom of the spirit is life and peace.",
    "Romans 8:7": "Because the wisdom of the flesh is an enemy to God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither can it be.",
    "Romans 8:8": "And they who are in the flesh, cannot please God.",
    "Romans 8:9": "But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.",
    "Romans 8:10": "And if Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead, because of sin; but the spirit liveth, because of justification.",
    "Romans 8:11": "And if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead, dwell in you; he that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead, shall quicken also your mortal bodies, because of his Spirit that dwelleth in you.",
    "Romans 8:12": "Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.",
    "Romans 8:13": "For if you live according to the flesh, you shall die: but if by the Spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh, you shall live.",
    "Romans 8:14": "For whosoever are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.",
    "Romans 8:15": "For you have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear; but you have received the spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry: Abba (Father).",
    "Romans 8:16": "For the Spirit himself giveth testimony to our spirit, that we are the sons of God.",
    "Romans 8:17": "And if sons, heirs also; heirs indeed of God, and joint heirs with Christ: yet so, if we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified with him.",
    "Romans 8:18": "For I reckon that the sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with the glory to come, that shall be revealed in us.",
    "Romans 8:19": "For the expectation of the creature waiteth for the revelation of the sons of God.",
    "Romans 8:20": "For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him that made it subject, in hope:",
    "Romans 8:21": "Because the creature also itself shall be delivered from the servitude of corruption, into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.",
    "Romans 8:22": "For we know that every creature groaneth and travaileth in pain, even till now.",
    "Romans 8:23": "And not only it, but ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption of the sons of God, the redemption of our body.",
    "Romans 8:24": "For we are saved by hope. But hope that is seen, is not hope. For what a man seeth, why doth he hope for?",
    "Romans 8:25": "But if we hope for that which we see not, we wait for it with patience.",
    "Romans 8:26": "Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity. For we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit himself asketh for us with unspeakable groanings.",
    "Romans 8:27": "And he that searcheth the hearts, knoweth what the Spirit desireth; because he asketh for the saints according to God.",
    "Romans 8:28": "And we know that to them that love God, all things work together unto good, to such as, according to his purpose, are called to be saints.",
    "Romans 8:29": "For whom he foreknew, he also predestinated to be made conformable to the image of his Son; that he might be the firstborn amongst many brethren.",
    "Romans 8:30": "And whom he predestinated, them he also called. And whom he called, them he also justified. And whom he justified, them he also glorified.",
    "Romans 8:31": "What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who is against us?",
    "Romans 8:32": "He that spared not even his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how hath he not also, with him, given us all things?",
    "Romans 8:33": "Who shall accuse against the elect of God? God that justifieth.",
    "Romans 8:34": "Who is he that shall condemn? Christ Jesus that died, yea that is risen also again; who is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.",
    "Romans 8:35": "Who then shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation? or distress? or famine? or nakedness? or danger? or persecution? or the sword?",
    "Romans 8:36": "(As it is written: For thy sake we are put to death all the day long. We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.)",
    "Romans 8:37": "But in all these things we overcome, because of him that hath loved us.",
    "Romans 8:38": "For I am sure that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor might,",
    "Romans 8:39": "Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.",
    "Romans 9:1": "I SPEAK the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost:",
    "Romans 9:2": "That I have great sadness, and continual sorrow in my heart.",
    "Romans 9:3": "For I wished myself to be an anathema from Christ, for my brethren, who are my kinsmen according to the flesh,",
    "Romans 9:4": "Who are Israelites, to whom belongeth the adoption as of children, and the glory, and the testament, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises:",
    "Romans 9:5": "Whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ, according to the flesh, who is over all things, God blessed for ever. Amen.",
    "Romans 9:6": "Not as though the word of God hath miscarried. For all are not Israelites that are of Israel:",
    "Romans 9:7": "Neither are all they that are the seed of Abraham, children; but in Isaac shall thy seed be called:",
    "Romans 9:8": "That is to say, not they that are the children of the flesh, are the children of God; but they, that are the children of the promise, are accounted for the seed.",
    "Romans 9:9": "For this is the word of promise: According to this time will I come; and Sara shall have a son.",
    "Romans 9:10": "And not only she. But when Rebecca also had conceived at once, of Isaac our father.",
    "Romans 9:11": "For when the children were not yet born, nor had done any good or evil (that the purpose of God, according to election, might stand,)",
    "Romans 9:12": "Not of works, but of him that calleth, it was said to her: The elder shall serve the younger.",
    "Romans 9:13": "As it is written: Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated.",
    "Romans 9:14": "What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? God forbid.",
    "Romans 9:15": "For he saith to Moses: I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy; and I will shew mercy to whom I will shew mercy.",
    "Romans 9:16": "So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.",
    "Romans 9:17": "For the scripture saith to Pharao: To this purpose have I raised thee, that I may shew my power in thee, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.",
    "Romans 9:18": "Therefore he hath mercy on whom he will; and whom he will, he hardeneth.",
    "Romans 9:19": "Thou wilt say therefore to me: Why doth he then find fault? for who resisteth his will?",
    "Romans 9:20": "O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it: Why hast thou made me thus?",
    "Romans 9:21": "Or hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump, to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?",
    "Romans 9:22": "What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath, fitted for destruction,",
    "Romans 9:23": "That he might shew the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he hath prepared unto glory?",
    "Romans 9:24": "Even us, whom also he hath called, nor only of the Jews, but also of the Gentiles.",
    "Romans 9:25": "As in Osee he saith: I will call that which was not my people, my people; and her that was not beloved, beloved; and her that had not obtained mercy, one that hath obtained mercy.",
    "Romans 9:26": "And it shall be, in the place where it was said unto them, You are not my people; there they shall be called the sons of the living God.",
    "Romans 9:27": "And Isaias crieth out concerning Israel: If the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved.",
    "Romans 9:28": "For he shall finish his word, and cut it short in justice; because a short word shall the Lord make upon the earth.",
    "Romans 9:29": "And as Isaias foretold: Unless the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been made as Sodom, and we had been like unto Gomorrha.",
    "Romans 9:30": "What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who followed not after justice, have attained to justice, even the justice that is of faith.",
    "Romans 9:31": "But Israel, by following after the law of justice, is not come unto the law of justice.",
    "Romans 9:32": "Why so? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were of works. For they stumbled at the stumblingstone.",
    "Romans 9:33": "As it is written: Behold I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and a rock of scandal; and whosoever believeth in him shall not be confounded.",
    "Romans 10:1": "BRETHREN, the will of my heart, indeed, and my prayer to God, is for them unto salvation.",
    "Romans 10:2": "For I bear them witness, that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.",
    "Romans 10:3": "For they, not knowing the justice of God, and seeking to establish their own, have not submitted themselves to the justice of God.",
    "Romans 10:4": "For the end of the law is Christ, unto justice to every one that believeth.",
    "Romans 10:5": "For Moses wrote, that the justice which is of the law, the man that shall do it, shall live by it.",
    "Romans 10:6": "But the justice which is of faith, speaketh thus: Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? that is, to bring Christ down;",
    "Romans 10:7": "Or who shall descend into the deep? that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.",
    "Romans 10:8": "But what saith the scripture? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart. This is the word of faith, which we preach.",
    "Romans 10:9": "For if thou confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thy heart that God hath raised him up from the dead, thou shalt be saved.",
    "Romans 10:10": "For, with the heart, we believe unto justice; but, with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation.",
    "Romans 10:11": "For the scripture saith: Whosoever believeth in him, shall not be confounded.",
    "Romans 10:12": "For there is no distinction of the Jew and the Greek: for the same is Lord over all, rich unto all that call upon him.",
    "Romans 10:13": "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved.",
    "Romans 10:14": "How then shall they call on him, in whom they have not believed? Or how shall they believe him, of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear, without a preacher?",
    "Romans 10:15": "And how shall they preach unless they be sent, as it is written: How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, of them that bring glad tidings of good things!",
    "Romans 10:16": "But all do not obey the gospel. For Isaias saith: Lord, who hath believed our report?",
    "Romans 10:17": "Faith then cometh by hearing; and hearing by the word of Christ.",
    "Romans 10:18": "But I say: Have they not heard? Yes, verily, their sound hath gone forth into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the whole world.",
    "Romans 10:19": "But I say: Hath not Israel known? First, Moses saith: I will provoke you to jealousy by that which is not a nation; by a foolish nation I will anger you.",
    "Romans 10:20": "But Isaias is bold, and saith: I was found by them that did not seek me: I appeared openly to them that asked not after me.",
    "Romans 10:21": "But to Israel he saith: All the day long have I spread my hands to a people that believeth not, and contradicteth me.",
    "Romans 11:1": "I SAY then: Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.",
    "Romans 11:2": "God hath not cast away his people, which he foreknew. Know you not what the scripture saith of Elias; how he calleth on God against Israel?",
    "Romans 11:3": "Lord, they have slain thy prophets, they have dug down thy altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.",
    "Romans 11:4": "But what saith the divine answer to him? I have left me seven thousand men, that have not bowed their knees to Baal.",
    "Romans 11:5": "Even so then at this present time also, there is a remnant saved according to the election of grace.",
    "Romans 11:6": "And if by grace, it is not now by works: otherwise grace is no more grace.",
    "Romans 11:7": "What then? That which Israel sought, he hath not obtained: but the election hath obtained it; and the rest have been blinded.",
    "Romans 11:8": "As it is written: God hath given them the spirit of insensibility; eyes that they should not see; and ears that they should not hear, until this present day.",
    "Romans 11:9": "And David saith: Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompense unto them.",
    "Romans 11:10": "Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see: and bow down their back always.",
    "Romans 11:11": "I say then, have they so stumbled, that they should fall? God forbid. But by their offence, salvation is come to the Gentiles, that they may be emulous of them.",
    "Romans 11:12": "Now if the offence of them be the riches of the world, and the diminution of them, the riches of the Gentiles; how much more the fulness of them?",
    "Romans 11:13": "For I say to you, Gentiles: as long indeed as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I will honour my ministry,",
    "Romans 11:14": "If, by any means, I may provoke to emulation them who are my flesh, and may save some of them.",
    "Romans 11:15": "For if the loss of them be the reconciliation of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?",
    "Romans 11:16": "For if the firstfruit be holy, so is the lump also: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.",
    "Romans 11:17": "And if some of the branches be broken, and thou, being a wild olive, art ingrafted in them, and art made partaker of the root, and of the fatness of the olive tree,",
    "Romans 11:18": "Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.",
    "Romans 11:19": "Thou wilt say then: The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.",
    "Romans 11:20": "Well: because of unbelief they were broken off. But thou standest by faith: be not highminded, but fear.",
    "Romans 11:21": "For if God hath not spared the natural branches, fear lest perhaps he also spare not thee.",
    "Romans 11:22": "See then the goodness and the severity of God: towards them indeed that are fallen, the severity; but towards thee, the goodness of God, if thou abide in goodness, otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.",
    "Romans 11:23": "And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.",
    "Romans 11:24": "For if thou wert cut out of the wild olive tree, which is natural to thee; and, contrary to nature, were grafted into the good olive tree; how much more shall they that are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?",
    "Romans 11:25": "For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, of this mystery, (lest you should be wise in your own conceits), that blindness in part has happened in Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles should come in.",
    "Romans 11:26": "And so all Israel should be saved, as it is written: There shall come out of Sion, he that shall deliver, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.",
    "Romans 11:27": "And this is to them my covenant: when I shall take away their sins.",
    "Romans 11:28": "As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are most dear for the sake of the fathers.",
    "Romans 11:29": "For the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance.",
    "Romans 11:30": "For as you also in times past did not believe God, but now have obtained mercy, through their unbelief;",
    "Romans 11:31": "So these also now have not believed, for your mercy, that they also may obtain mercy.",
    "Romans 11:32": "For God hath concluded all in unbelief, that he may have mercy on all.",
    "Romans 11:33": "O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God! How incomprehensible are his judgments, and how unsearchable his ways!",
    "Romans 11:34": "For who hath known the mind of the Lord? Or who hath been his counsellor?",
    "Romans 11:35": "Or who hath first given to him, and recompense shall be made him?",
    "Romans 11:36": "For of him, and by him, and in him, are all things: to him be glory for ever. Amen.",
    "Romans 12:1": "I BESEECH you therefore, brethren, by the mercy of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, pleasing unto God, your reasonable service.",
    "Romans 12:2": "And be not conformed to this world; but be reformed in the newness of your mind, that you may prove what is the good, and the acceptable, and the perfect will of God.",
    "Romans 12:3": "For I say, by the grace that is given me, to all that are among you, not to be more wise than it behoveth to be wise, but to be wise unto sobriety, and according as God hath divided to every one the measure of faith.",
    "Romans 12:4": "For as in one body we have many members, but all the members have not the same office:",
    "Romans 12:5": "So we being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.",
    "Romans 12:6": "And having different gifts, according to the grace that is given us, either prophecy, to be used according to the rule of faith;",
    "Romans 12:7": "Or ministry, in ministering; or he that teacheth, in doctrine;",
    "Romans 12:8": "He that exhorteth, in exhorting; he that giveth, with simplicity; he that ruleth, with carefulness; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.",
    "Romans 12:9": "Let love be without dissimulation. Hating that which is evil, cleaving to that which is good.",
    "Romans 12:10": "Loving one another with the charity of brotherhood, with honour preventing one another.",
    "Romans 12:11": "In carefulness not slothful. In spirit fervent. Serving the Lord.",
    "Romans 12:12": "Rejoicing in hope. Patient in tribulation. Instant in prayer.",
    "Romans 12:13": "Communicating to the necessities of the saints. Pursuing hospitality.",
    "Romans 12:14": "Bless them that persecute you: bless, and curse not.",
    "Romans 12:15": "Rejoice with them that rejoice; weep with them that weep.",
    "Romans 12:16": "Being of one mind one towards another. Not minding high things, but consenting to the humble. Be not wise in your own conceits.",
    "Romans 12:17": "To no man rendering evil for evil. Providing good things, not only in the sight of God, but also in the sight of all men.",
    "Romans 12:18": "If it be possible, as much as is in you, have peace with all men.",
    "Romans 12:19": "Revenge not yourselves, my dearly beloved; but give place unto wrath, for it is written: Revenge is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.",
    "Romans 12:20": "But if thy enemy be hungry, give him to eat; if he thirst, give him to drink. For, doing this, thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.",
    "Romans 12:21": "Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil by good.",
    "Romans 13:1": "LET every soul be subject to higher powers: for there is no power but from God: and those that are, are ordained of God.",
    "Romans 13:2": "Therefore he that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God. And they that resist, purchase to themselves damnation.",
    "Romans 13:3": "For princes are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good: and thou shalt have praise from the same.",
    "Romans 13:4": "For he is Godâ€™s minister to thee, for good. But if thou do that which is evil, fear: for he beareth not the sword in vain. For he is Godâ€™s minister: an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.",
    "Romans 13:5": "Wherefore be subject of necessity, not only for wrath, but also for conscienceâ€™ sake.",
    "Romans 13:6": "For therefore also you pay tribute. For they are the ministers of God, serving unto this purpose.",
    "Romans 13:7": "Render therefore to all men their dues. Tribute, to whom tribute is due: custom, to whom custom: fear, to whom fear: honour, to whom honour.",
    "Romans 13:8": "Owe no man any thing, but to love one another. For he that loveth his neighbour, hath fulfilled the law.",
    "Romans 13:9": "For Thou shalt not commit adultery: Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness: Thou shalt not covet: and if there be any other commandment, it is comprised in this word, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.",
    "Romans 13:10": "The love of our neighbour worketh no evil. Love therefore is the fulfilling of the law.",
    "Romans 13:11": "And that knowing the season; that it is now the hour for us to rise from sleep. For now our salvation is nearer than when we believed.",
    "Romans 13:12": "The night is passed, and the day is at hand. Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and put on the armour of light.",
    "Romans 13:13": "Let us walk honestly, as in the day: not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and impurities, not in contention and envy:",

    "Romans 14:8": "For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the Lord. Therefore, whether we live, or whether we die, we are the Lordâ€™s.",
    "Romans 14:9": "For to this end Christ died and rose again; that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.",
    "Romans 14:10": "But thou, why judgest thou thy brother? or thou, why dost thou despise thy brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.",
    "Romans 14:11": "For it is written: As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.",
    "Romans 14:12": "Therefore every one of us shall render account to God for himself.",
    "Romans 14:13": "Let us not therefore judge one another any more. But judge this rather, that you put not a stumblingblock or a scandal in your brotherâ€™s way.",
    "Romans 14:14": "I know, and am confident in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself; but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.",
    "Romans 14:15": "For if, because of thy meat, thy brother be grieved, thou walkest not now according to charity. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.",
    "Romans 14:16": "Let not then our good be evil spoken of.",
    "Romans 14:17": "For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but justice, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.",
    "Romans 14:18": "For he that in this serveth Christ, pleaseth God, and is approved of men.",
    "Romans 14:19": "Therefore let us follow after the things that are of peace; and keep the things that are of edification one towards another.",
    "Romans 14:20": "Destroy not the work of God for meat. All things indeed are clean: but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.",
    "Romans 14:21": "It is good not to eat flesh, and not to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother is offended, or scandalized, or made weak.",
    "Romans 14:22": "Hast thou faith? Have it to thyself before God. Blessed is he that condemneth not himself in that which he alloweth.",
    "Romans 14:23": "But he that discerneth, if he eat, is condemned; because not of faith. For all that is not of faith is sin.",
    "Romans 15:1": "NOW we that are stronger, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.",
    "Romans 15:2": "Let every one of you please his neighbour unto good, to edification.",
    "Romans 15:3": "For Christ did not please himself, but as it is written: The reproaches of them that reproached thee, fell upon me.",
    "Romans 15:4": "For what things soever were written, were written for our learning: that through patience and the comfort of the scriptures, we might have hope.",
    "Romans 15:5": "Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of one mind one towards another, according to Jesus Christ:",
    "Romans 15:6": "That with one mind, and with one mouth, you may glorify God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "Romans 15:7": "Wherefore receive one another, as Christ also hath received you unto the honour of God.",
    "Romans 15:8": "For I say that Christ Jesus was minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers.",
    "Romans 15:9": "But that the Gentiles are to glorify God for his mercy, as it is written: Therefore will I confess to thee, O Lord, among the Gentiles, and will sing to thy name.",
    "Romans 15:10": "And again he saith: Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.",
    "Romans 15:11": "And again: Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and magnify him, all ye people.",
    "Romans 15:12": "And again Isaias saith: There shall be a root of Jesse; and he that shall rise up to rule the Gentiles, in him the Gentiles shall hope.",
    "Romans 15:13": "Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing; that you may abound in hope, and in the power of the Holy Ghost.",
    "Romans 15:14": "And I myself also, my brethren, am assured of you, that you also are full of love, replenished with all knowledge, so that you are able to admonish one another.",
    "Romans 15:15": "But I have written to you, brethren, more boldly in some sort, as it were putting you in mind: because of the grace which is given me from God.",
    "Romans 15:16": "That I should be the minister of Christ Jesus among the Gentiles; sanctifying the gospel of God, that the oblation of the Gentiles may be made acceptable and sanctified in the Holy Ghost.",
    "Romans 15:17": "I have therefore glory in Christ Jesus towards God.",
    "Romans 15:18": "For I dare not to speak of any of those things which Christ worketh not by me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,",
    "Romans 15:19": "By the virtue of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Ghost, so that from Jerusalem round about as far as unto Illyricum, I have replenished the gospel of Christ.",
    "Romans 15:20": "And I have so preached this gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another manâ€™s foundation.",
    "Romans 15:21": "But as it is written: They to whom he was not spoken of, shall see, and they that have not heard shall understand.",
    "Romans 15:22": "For which cause also I was hindered very much from coming to you, and have been kept away till now.",
    "Romans 15:23": "But now having no more place in these countries, and having a great desire these many years past to come unto you,",
    "Romans 15:24": "When I shall begin to take my journey into Spain, I hope that as I pass, I shall see you, and be brought on my way thither by you, if first, in part, I shall have enjoyed you:",
    "Romans 15:25": "But now I shall go to Jerusalem, to minister unto the saints.",
    "Romans 15:26": "For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a contribution for the poor of the saints that are in Jerusalem.",
    "Romans 15:27": "For it hath pleased them; and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they ought also in carnal things to minister to them.",
    "Romans 15:28": "When therefore I shall have accomplished this, and consigned to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.",
    "Romans 15:29": "And I know, that when I come to you, I shall come in the abundance of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.",
    "Romans 15:30": "I beseech you therefore, brethren, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the charity of the Holy Ghost, that you help me in your prayers for me to God,",
    "Romans 15:31": "That I may be delivered from the unbelievers that are in Judea, and that the oblation of my service may be acceptable in Jerusalem to the saints.",
    "Romans 15:32": "That I may come to you with joy, by the will of God, and may be refreshed with you.",
    "Romans 15:33": "Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.",
    "Romans 16:1": "AND I commend to you Phebe, our sister, who is in the ministry of the church, that is in Cenchrae:",
    "Romans 16:2": "That you receive her in the Lord as becometh saints; and that you assist her in whatsoever business she shall have need of you. For she also hath assisted many, and myself also.",
    "Romans 16:3": "Salute Prisca and Aquila, my helpers in Christ Jesus,",
    "Romans 16:4": "(Who have for my life laid down their own necks: to whom not I only give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles,)",
    "Romans 16:5": "And the church which is in their house. Salute Epenetus, my beloved: who is the firstfruits of Asia in Christ.",

    "Romans 16:17": "Now I beseech you, brethren, to mark them who make dissensions and offences contrary to the doctrine which you have learned, and avoid them.",
    "Romans 16:18": "For they that are such, serve not Christ our Lord, but their own belly; and by pleasing speeches and good words, seduce the hearts of the innocent.",
    "Romans 16:19": "For your obedience is published in every place. I rejoice therefore in you. But I would have you to be wise in good, and simple in evil.",
    "Romans 16:20": "And the God of peace crush Satan under your feet speedily. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.",
    "Romans 16:21": "Timothy, my fellow labourer, saluteth you, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen.",
    "Romans 16:22": "I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.",
    "Romans 16:23": "Caius, my host, and the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus, the treasurer of the city, saluteth you, and Quartus, a brother.",
    "Romans 16:24": "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.",
    "Romans 16:25": "Now to him that is able to establish you, according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret from eternity,",
    "Romans 16:26": "(Which now is made manifest by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the precept of the eternal God, for the obedience of faith,) known among all nations;",
    "Romans 16:27": "To God the only wise, through Jesus Christ, to whom be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:1": "PAUL, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Sosthenes a brother,",
    "1 Corinthians 1:2": "To the church of God that is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, in every place of theirs and ours.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:3": "Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:4": "I give thanks to my God always for you, for the grace of God that is given you in Christ Jesus,",
    "1 Corinthians 1:5": "That in all things you are made rich in him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;",
    "1 Corinthians 1:6": "As the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,",
    "1 Corinthians 1:7": "So that nothing is wanting to you in any grace, waiting for the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:8": "Who also will confirm you unto the end without crime, in the day of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:9": "God is faithful: by whom you are called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:10": "Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no schisms among you; but that you be perfect in the same mind, and in the same judgment.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:11": "For it hath been signified unto me, my brethren, of you, by them that are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:12": "Now this I say, that every one of you saith: I indeed am of Paul; and I am of Apollo; and I am of Cephas; and I of Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:13": "Is Christ divided? Was Paul then crucified for you? or were you baptized in the name of Paul?",
    "1 Corinthians 1:14": "I give God thanks, that I baptized none of you but Crispus and Caius;",
    "1 Corinthians 1:15": "Lest any should say that you were baptized in my name.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:16": "And I baptized also the household of Stephanus; besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:17": "For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of speech, lest the cross of Christ should be made void.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:18": "For the word of the cross, to them indeed that perish, is foolishness; but to them that are saved, that is, to us, it is the power of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:19": "For it is written: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the prudence of the prudent I will reject.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:20": "Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?",
    "1 Corinthians 1:21": "For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world, by wisdom, knew not God, it pleased God, by the foolishness of our preaching, to save them that believe.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:22": "For both the Jews require signs, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:",
    "1 Corinthians 1:23": "But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews indeed a stumblingblock, and unto the Gentiles foolishness:",
    "1 Corinthians 1:24": "But unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:25": "For the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:26": "For see your vocation, brethren, that there are not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble:",
    "1 Corinthians 1:27": "But the foolish things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the wise; and the weak things of the world hath God chosen, that he may confound the strong.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:28": "And the base things of the world, and the things that are contemptible, hath God chosen, and things that are not, that he might bring to nought things that are:",
    "1 Corinthians 1:29": "That no flesh should glory in his sight.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:30": "But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and justice, and sanctification, and redemption:",
    "1 Corinthians 1:31": "That, as it is written: He that glorieth, may glory in the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:1": "AND I, brethren, when I came to you, came not in loftiness of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:2": "For I judged not myself to know anything among you, but Jesus Christ, and him crucified.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:3": "And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:4": "And my speech and my preaching was not in the persuasive words of human wisdom, but in shewing of the Spirit and power;",
    "1 Corinthians 2:5": "That your faith might not stand on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:6": "Howbeit we speak wisdom among the perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, neither of the princes of this world that come to nought;",
    "1 Corinthians 2:7": "But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, a wisdom which is hidden, which God ordained before the world, unto our glory :",
    "1 Corinthians 2:8": "Which none of the princes of this world knew; for if they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:9": "But, as it is written: That eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what things God hath prepared for them that love him.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:10": "But to us God hath revealed them, by this Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:11": "For what man knoweth the things of a man, but the spirit of a man that is in him? So the things also that are of God no man knoweth, but the Spirit of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:12": "Now we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit that is of God; that we may know the things that are given us from God.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:13": "Which things also we speak, not in the learned words of human wisdom; but in the doctrine of the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:14": "But the sensual man perceiveth not these things that are of the Spirit of God; for it is foolishness to him, and he cannot understand, because it is spiritually examined.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:15": "But the spiritual man judgeth all things; and he himself is judged of no man.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:16": "For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that we may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:1": "AND I, brethren, could not speak to you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal. As unto little ones in Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:2": "I gave you milk to drink, not meat; for you were not able as yet. But neither indeed are you now able; for you are yet carnal.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:3": "For, whereas there is among you envying and contention, are you not carnal, and walk according to man ?",
    "1 Corinthians 3:4": "For while one saith, I indeed am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollo; are you not men ? What then is Apollo, and what is Paul?",
    "1 Corinthians 3:5": "The ministers of him whom you have believed; and to every one as the Lord hath given.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:6": "I have planted, Apollo watered, but God gave the increase.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:7": "Therefore, neither he that planteth is any thing, nor he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:8": "Now he that planteth, and he that watereth, are one. And every man shall receive his own reward, according to his own labour.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:9": "For we are Godâ€™s coadjutors: you are Godâ€™s husbandry; you are Godâ€™s building.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:10": "According to the grace of God that is given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:11": "For other foundation no man can lay, but that which is laid; which is Christ Jesus.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:12": "Now if any man build upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble:",
    "1 Corinthians 3:13": "Every manâ€™s work shall be manifest; for the day of the Lord shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in fire; and the fire shall try every manâ€™s work, of what sort it is.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:14": "If any manâ€™s work abide, which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:15": "If any manâ€™s work burn, he shall suffer loss; but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:16": "Know you not, that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you ?",
    "1 Corinthians 3:17": "But if any man violate the temple of God, him shall God destroy. For the temple of God is holy, which you are.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:18": "Let no man deceive himself: if any man among you seem to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:19": "For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written: I will catch the wise in their own craftiness.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:20": "And again: The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:21": "Let no man therefore glory in men.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:22": "For all things are yours, whether it be Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to some; for all are yours;",
    "1 Corinthians 3:23": "And you are Christâ€™s; and Christ is Godâ€™s.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:1": "LET a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ, and the dispensers of the mysteries of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:2": "Here now it is required among the dispensers, that a man be found faithful.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:3": "But to me it is a very small thing to be judged by you, or by manâ€™s day; but neither do I judge my own self.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:4": "For I am not conscious to myself of any thing, yet am I not hereby justified; but he that judgeth me, is the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:5": "Therefore judge not before the time; until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall every man have praise from God.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:6": "But these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollo, for your sakes; that in us you may learn, that one be not puffed up against the other for another, above that which is written.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:7": "For who distinguisheth thee ? Or what hast thou that thou hast not received ? And if thou hast received, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it ?",
    "1 Corinthians 4:8": "You are now full; you are now become rich; you reign without us; and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:9": "For I think that God hath set forth us apostles, the last, as it were men appointed to death: we are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:10": "We are fools for Christâ€™s sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are honourable, but we without honour.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:11": "Even unto this hour we both hunger and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no fixed abode;",
    "1 Corinthians 4:12": "And we labour, working with our own hands: we are reviled, and we bless; we are persecuted, and we suffer it.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:13": "We are blasphemed, and we entreat; we are made as the refuse of this world, the offscouring of all even until now.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:14": "I write not these things to confound you; but I admonish you as my dearest children.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:15": "For if you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus, by the gospel, I have begotten you.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:16": "Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:17": "For this cause have I sent to you Timothy, who is my dearest son and faithful in the Lord; who will put you in mind of my ways, which are in Christ Jesus; as I teach every where in every church.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:18": "As if I would not come to you, so some are puffed up.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:19": "But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will: and will know, not the speech of them that are puffed up, but the power.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:20": "For the kingdom of God is not in speech, but in power.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:21": "What will you ? shall I come to you with a rod; or in charity, and in the spirit of meekness ?",
    "1 Corinthians 5:1": "IT is absolutely heard, that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as the like is not among the heathens; that one should have his fatherâ€™s wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:2": "And you are puffed up; and have not rather mourned, that he might be taken away from among you, that hath done this deed.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:3": "I indeed, absent in body, but present in spirit, have already judged, as though I were present, him that hath so done,",
    "1 Corinthians 5:4": "In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus;",
    "1 Corinthians 5:5": "To deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:6": "Your glorying is not good. Know you not that a little leaven corrupteth the whole lump ?",
    "1 Corinthians 5:7": "Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new paste, as you are unleavened. For Christ our pasch is sacrificed.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:8": "Therefore let us feast, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:9": "I wrote to you in an epistle, not to keep company with fornicators.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:10": "I mean not with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or the extortioners, or the servers of idols; otherwise you must needs go out of this world.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:11": "But now I have written to you, not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother, be a fornicator, or covetous, or a server of idols, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner: with such a one, not so much as to eat.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:12": "For what have I to do to judge them that are without ? Do not you judge them that are within ?",
    "1 Corinthians 5:13": "For them that are without, God will judge. Put away the evil one from among yourselves.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:1": "DARE any of you, having a matter against another, go to be judged before the unjust, and not before the saints ?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:2": "Know you not that the saints shall judge this world ? And if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters ?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:3": "Know you not that we shall judge angels ? how much more things of this world ?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:4": "If therefore you have judgments of things pertaining to this world, set them to judge, who are the most despised in the church.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:5": "I speak to your shame. Is it so that there is not among you any one wise man, that is able to judge between his brethren ?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:6": "But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:7": "Already indeed there is plainly a fault among you, that you have lawsuits one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong? Why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:8": "But you do wrong and defraud, and that to your brethren.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:9": "Know you not that the unjust shall not possess the kingdom of God? Do not err: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers,",
    "1 Corinthians 6:10": "Nor the effeminate, nor liers with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor railers, nor extortioners, shall possess the kingdom of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:11": "And such some of you were; but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Spirit of our God.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:12": "All things are lawful to me, but all things are not expedient. All things are lawful to me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:13": "Meat for the belly, and the belly for the meats; but God shall destroy both it and them: but the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:14": "Now God hath both raised up the Lord, and will raise us up also by his power.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:15": "Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot ? God forbid.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:16": "Or know you not, that he who is joined to a harlot, is made one body ? For they shall be, saith he, two in one flesh.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:17": "But he who is joined to the Lord, is one spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:18": "Fly fornication. Every sin that a man doth, is without the body; but he that committeth fornication, sinneth against his own body.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:19": "Or know you not, that your members are the temple of the Holy Ghost, who is in you, whom you have from God; and you are not your own ?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:20": "For you are bought with a great price. Glorify and bear God in your body.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:1": "NOW concerning the thing whereof you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:2": "But for fear of fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:3": "Let the husband render the debt to his wife, and the wife also in like manner to the husband.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:4": "The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband. And in like manner the husband also hath not power of his own body, but the wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:5": "Defraud not one another, except, perhaps, by consent, for a time, that you may give yourselves to prayer; and return together again, lest Satan tempt you for your incontinency.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:6": "But I speak this by indulgence, not by commandment.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:7": "For I would that all men were even as myself: but every one hath his proper gift from God; one after this manner, and another after that.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:8": "But I say to the unmarried, and to the widows: It is good for them if they so continue, even as I.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:9": "But if they do not contain themselves, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to be burnt.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:10": "But to them that are married, not I but the Lord commandeth, that the wife depart not from her husband.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:11": "And if she depart, that she remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband. And let not the husband put away his wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:12": "For to the rest I speak, not the Lord. If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she consent to dwell with him, let him not put her away.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:13": "And if any woman hath a husband that believeth not, and he consent to dwell with her, let her not put away her husband.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:14": "For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife; and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband: otherwise your children should be unclean; but now they are holy.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:15": "But if the unbeliever depart, let him depart. For a brother or sister is not under servitude in such cases. But God hath called us in peace.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:16": "For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband ? Or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife ?",
    "1 Corinthians 7:17": "But as the Lord hath distributed to every one, as God hath called every one, so let him walk: and so in all churches I teach.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:18": "Is any man called, being circumcised ? let him not procure uncircumcision. Is any man called in uncircumcision ? let him not be circumcised.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:19": "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing: but the observance of the commandments of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:20": "Let every man abide in the same calling in which he was called.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:21": "Wast thou called, being a bondman ? care not for it; but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:22": "For he that is called in the Lord, being a bondman, is the freeman of the Lord. Likewise he that is called, being free, is the bondman of Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:23": "You are bought with a price; be not made the bondslaves of men.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:24": "Brethren, let every man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:25": "Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord; but I give counsel, as having obtained mercy of the Lord, to be faithful.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:26": "I think therefore that this is good for the present necessity, that it is good for a man so to be.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:27": "Art thou bound to a wife ? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife ? seek not a wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:28": "But if thou take a wife, thou hast not sinned. And if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned: nevertheless, such shall have tribulation of the flesh. But I spare you.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:29": "This therefore I say, brethren; the time is short; it remaineth, that they also who have wives, be as if they had none;",
    "1 Corinthians 7:30": "And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as if they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;",
    "1 Corinthians 7:31": "And they that use this world, as if they used it not: for the fashion of this world passeth away.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:32": "But I would have you to be without solicitude. He that is without a wife, is solicitous for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please God.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:33": "But he that is with a wife, is solicitous for the things of the world, how he may please his wife: and he is divided.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:34": "And the unmarried woman and the virgin thinketh on the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she that is married thinketh on the things of the world, how she may please her husband.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:35": "And this I speak for your profit: not to cast a snare upon you; but for that which is decent, and which may give you power to attend upon the Lord, without impediment.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:36": "But if any man think that he seemeth dishonoured, with regard to his virgin, for that she is above the age, and it must so be: let him do what he will; he sinneth not, if she marry.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:37": "For he that hath determined being steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but having power of his own will; and hath judged this in his heart, to keep his virgin, doth well.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:38": "Therefore, both he that giveth his virgin in marriage, doth well; and he that giveth her not, doth better.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:39": "A woman is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband die, she is at liberty: let her marry to whom she will; only in the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:40": "But more blessed shall she be, if she so remain, according to my counsel; and I think that I also have the spirit of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:1": "NOW concerning those things that are sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up; but charity edifieth.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:2": "And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he hath not yet known as he ought to know.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:3": "But if any any love God, the same is known by him.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:4": "But as for the meats that are sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:5": "For although there be that are called gods, either in heaven or on earth (for there be gods many, and lords many);",
    "1 Corinthians 8:6": "Yet to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:7": "But there is not knowledge in every one. For some until this present, with conscience of the idol: eat as a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:8": "But meat doth not commend us to God. For neither, if we eat, shall we have the more; nor, if we eat not, shall we have the less.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:9": "But take heed lest perhaps this your liberty become a stumblingblock to the weak.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:10": "For if a man see him that hath knowledge sit at meat in the idolâ€™s temple, shall not his conscience, being weak, be emboldened to eat those things which are sacrificed to idols ?",
    "1 Corinthians 8:11": "And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ hath died ?",
    "1 Corinthians 8:12": "Now when you sin thus against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:13": "Wherefore, if meat scandalize my brother, I will never eat flesh, lest I should scandalize my brother.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:1": "AM not I free? Am not I an apostle? Have not I seen Christ Jesus our Lord? Are not you my work in the Lord?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:2": "And if unto others I be not an apostle, but yet to you I am. For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:3": "My defence with them that do examine me is this.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:4": "Have not we power to eat and to drink?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:5": "Have we not power to carry about a woman, a sister, as well as the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:6": "Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to do this?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:7": "Who serveth as a soldier at any time, at his own charges? Who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? Who feedeth the flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:8": "Speak I these things according to man? Or doth not the law also say these things?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:9": "For it is written in the law of Moses: Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:10": "Or doth he say this indeed for our sakes? For these things are written for our sakes: that he that plougheth, should plough in hope; and he that thrasheth, in hope to receive fruit.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:11": "If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we reap your carnal things?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:12": "If others be partakers of this power over you, why not we rather? Nevertheless, we have not used this power: but we bear all things, lest we should give any hindrance to the gospel of Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:13": "Know you not, that they who work in the holy place, eat the things that are of the holy place; and they that serve the altar, partake with the altar?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:14": "So also the Lord ordained that they who preach the gospel, should live by the gospel.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:15": "But I have used none of these things. Neither have I written these things, that they should be so done unto me: for it is good for me to die, rather than that any man should make my glory void.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:16": "For if I preach the gospel, it is no glory to me, for a necessity lieth upon me: for woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:17": "For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation is committed to me:",
    "1 Corinthians 9:18": "What is my reward then? That preaching the gospel, I may deliver the gospel without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:19": "For whereas I was free as to all, I made myself the servant of all, that I might gain the more.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:20": "And I became to the Jews, a Jew, that I might gain the Jews:",
    "1 Corinthians 9:21": "To them that are under the law, as if I were under the law, (whereas myself was not under the law,) that I might gain them that were under the law. To them that were without the law, as if I were without the law, (whereas I was not without the law of God, but was in the law of Christ,) that I might gain them that were without the law.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:22": "To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak. I became all things to all men, that I might save all.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:23": "And I do all things for the gospelâ€™s sake: that I may be made partaker thereof.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:24": "Know you not that they that run in the race, all run indeed, but one receiveth the prize ? So run that you may obtain.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:25": "And every one that striveth for the mastery, refraineth himself from all things: and they indeed that they may receive a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible one.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:26": "I therefore so run, not as at an uncertainty: I so fight, not as one beating the air:",
    "1 Corinthians 9:27": "But I chastise my body, and bring it into subjection: lest perhaps, when I have preached to others, I myself should become a castaway.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:1": "FOR I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:2": "And all in Moses were baptized, in the cloud, and in the sea:",
    "1 Corinthians 10:3": "And did all eat the same spiritual food,",
    "1 Corinthians 10:4": "And all drank the same spiritual drink; (and they drank of the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ.)",
    "1 Corinthians 10:5": "But with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the desert.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:6": "Now these things were done in a figure of us, that we should not covet evil things as they also coveted.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:7": "Neither become ye idolaters, as some of them, as it is written: The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:8": "Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication, and there fell in one day three and twenty thousand.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:9": "Neither let us tempt Christ: as some of them tempted, and perished by the serpents.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:10": "Neither do you murmur: as some of them murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:11": "Now all these things happened to them in figure: and they are written for our correction, upon whom the ends of the world are come.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:12": "Wherefore he that thinketh himself to stand, let him take heed lest he fall.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:13": "Let no temptation take hold on you, but such as is human. And God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able: but will make also with temptation issue, that you may be able to bear it.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:14": "Wherefore, my dearly beloved, fly from the service of idols.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:15": "I speak as to wise men: judge ye yourselves what I say.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:16": "The chalice of benediction, which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ ? And the bread, which we break, is it not the partaking of the body of the Lord ?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:17": "For we, being many, are one bread, one body, all that partake of one bread.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:18": "Behold Israel according to the flesh: are not they, that eat of the sacrifices, partakers of the altar ?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:19": "What then ? Do I say, that what is offered in sacrifice to idols, is any thing ? Or, that the idol is any thing ?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:20": "But the things which the heathens sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God. And I would not that you should be made partakers with devils.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:21": "You cannot drink the chalice of the Lord, and the chalice of devils: you cannot be partakers of the table of the Lord, and of the table of devils.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:22": "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy ? Are we stronger than he? All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:23": "All things are lawful for me, but all things do not edify.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:24": "Let no man seek his own, but that which is anotherâ€™s.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:25": "Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat; asking no question for conscienceâ€™ sake.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:26": "The earth is the Lordâ€™s, and the fulness thereof.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:27": "If any of them that believe not, invite you, and you will be willing to go; eat of any thing that is set before you, asking no question for conscienceâ€™ sake.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:28": "But if any man say: This has been sacrificed to idols, do not eat of it for his sake that told it, and for conscienceâ€™ sake.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:29": "Conscience, I say, not thy own, but the otherâ€™s. For why is my liberty judged by another manâ€™s conscience ?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:30": "If I partake with thanksgiving, why am I evil spoken of, for that for which I give thanks ?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:31": "Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatsoever else you do, do all to the glory of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:32": "Be without offence to the Jews, and to the Gentiles, and to the church of God:",
    "1 Corinthians 10:33": "As I also in all things please all men, not seeking that which is profitable to myself, but to many, that may be saved.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:1": "BE ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:2": "Now I praise you, brethren, that in all things you are mindful of me: and keep my ordinances as I have delivered them to you.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:3": "But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:4": "Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered, disgraceth his head.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:5": "But every woman praying or prophesying with her head not covered, disgraceth her head: for it is all one as if she were shaven.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:6": "For if a woman be not covered, let her be shorn. But if it be a shame to a woman to be shorn or made bald, let her cover her head.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:7": "The man indeed ought not to cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:8": "For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:9": "For the man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:10": "Therefore ought the woman to have a power over her head, because of the angels.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:11": "But yet neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:12": "For as the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman: but all things of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:13": "You yourselves judge: doth it become a woman, to pray unto God uncovered?",
    "1 Corinthians 11:14": "Doth not even nature itself teach you, that a man indeed, if he nourish his hair, it is a shame unto him?",
    "1 Corinthians 11:15": "But if a woman nourish her hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her for a covering.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:16": "But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the church of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:17": "Now this I ordain: not praising you, that you come together not for the better, but for the worse.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:18": "For first of all I hear that when you come together in the church, there are schisms among you; and in part I believe it.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:19": "For there must be also heresies: that they also, who are approved, may be made manifest among you.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:20": "When you come therefore together into one place, it is not now to eat the Lordâ€™s supper.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:21": "For every one taketh before his own supper to eat. And one indeed is hungry and another is drunk.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:22": "What, have you not houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the church of God; and put them to shame that have not ? What shall I say to you? Do I praise you? In this I praise you not.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:23": "For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:24": "And giving thanks, broke, and said: Take ye, and eat: this is my body, which shall be delivered for you: this do for the commemoration of me.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:25": "In like manner also the chalice, after he had supped, saying: This chalice is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as often as you shall drink, for the commemoration of me.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:26": "For as often as you shall eat this bread, and drink the chalice, you shall shew the death of the Lord, until he come.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:27": "Therefore whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:28": "But let a man prove himself: and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of the chalice.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:29": "For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:30": "Therefore are there many inform and weak among you, and many sleep.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:31": "But if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:32": "But whilst we are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:33": "Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:34": "If any man be hungry, let him eat at home; that you come not together unto judgment. And the rest I will set in order, when I come.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:1": "NOW concerning spiritual things, my brethren, I would not have you ignorant.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:2": "You know that when you were heathens, you went to dumb idols, according as you were led.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:3": "Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man, speaking by the Spirit of God, saith Anathema to Jesus. And no man can say the Lord Jesus, but by the Holy Ghost.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:4": "Now there are diversities of graces, but the same Spirit;",
    "1 Corinthians 12:5": "And there are diversities of ministries, but the same Lord;",
    "1 Corinthians 12:6": "And there are diversities of operations, but the same God, who worketh all in all.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:7": "And the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man unto profit.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:8": "To one indeed, by the Spirit, is given the word of wisdom: and to another, the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;",
    "1 Corinthians 12:9": "To another, faith in the same spirit; to another, the grace of healing in one Spirit;",
    "1 Corinthians 12:10": "To another, the working of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, the discerning of spirits; to another, diverse kinds of tongues; to another, interpretation of speeches.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:11": "But all these things one and the same Spirit worketh, dividing to every one according as he will.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:12": "For as the body is one, and hath many members; and all the members of the body, whereas they are many, yet are one body, so also is Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:13": "For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free; and in one Spirit we have all been made to drink.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:14": "For the body also is not one member, but many.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:15": "If the foot should say, because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body ?",
    "1 Corinthians 12:16": "And if the ear should say, because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body ?",
    "1 Corinthians 12:17": "If the whole body were the eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?",
    "1 Corinthians 12:18": "But now God hath set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:19": "And if they all were one member, where would be the body?",
    "1 Corinthians 12:20": "But now there are many members indeed, yet one body.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:21": "And the eye cannot say to the hand: I need not thy help; nor again the head to the feet: I have no need of you.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:22": "Yea, much more those that seem to be the more feeble members of the body, are more necessary.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:23": "And such as we think to be the less honourable members of the body, about these we put more abundant honour; and those that are our uncomely parts, have more abundant comeliness.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:24": "But our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, giving to that which wanted the more abundant honour,",
    "1 Corinthians 12:25": "That there might be no schism in the body; but the members might be mutually careful one for another.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:26": "And if one member suffer any thing, all the members suffer with it; or if one member glory, all the members rejoice with it.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:27": "Now you are the body of Christ, and members of member.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:28": "And God indeed hath set some in the church; first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly doctors; after that miracles; then the graces of healing, helps, governments, kinds of tongues, interpretations of speeches.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:29": "Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all doctors?",
    "1 Corinthians 12:30": "Are all workers of miracles? Have all the grace of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?",
    "1 Corinthians 12:31": "But be zealous for the better gifts. And I shew unto you yet a more excellent way.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:1": "IF I speak with the tongues of men, and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:2": "And if I should have prophecy and should know all mysteries, and all knowledge, and if I should have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:3": "And if I should distribute all my goods to feed the poor, and if I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:4": "Charity is patient, is kind: charity envieth not, dealeth not perversely; is not puffed up;",
    "1 Corinthians 13:5": "Is not ambitious, seeketh not her own, is not provoked to anger, thinketh no evil;",
    "1 Corinthians 13:6": "Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth with the truth;",
    "1 Corinthians 13:7": "Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:8": "Charity never falleth away: whether prophecies shall be made void, or tongues shall cease, or knowledge shall be destroyed.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:9": "For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:10": "But when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:11": "When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child. But, when I became a man, I put away the things of a child.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:12": "We see now through a glass in a dark manner; but then face to face. Now I know I part; but then I shall know even as I am known.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:13": "And now there remain faith, hope, and charity, these three: but the greatest of these is charity.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:1": "FOLLOW after charity, be zealous for spiritual gifts; but rather that you may prophesy.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:2": "For he that speaketh in a tongue, speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man heareth. Yet by the Spirit he speaketh mysteries.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:3": "But he that prophesieth, speaketh to men unto edification, and exhortation, and comfort.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:4": "He that speaketh in a tongue, edifieth himself: but he that prophesieth, edifieth the church.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:5": "And I would have you all to speak with tongues, but rather to prophesy. For greater is he that prophesieth, than he that speaketh with tongues: unless perhaps he interpret, that the church may receive edification.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:6": "But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in doctrine?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:7": "Even things without life that give sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction of sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped ?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:8": "For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle ?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:9": "So likewise you, except you utter by the tongue plain speech, how shall it be known what is said ? For you shall be speaking into the air.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:10": "There are, for example, so many kinds of tongues in this world; and none is without voice.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:11": "If then I know not the power of the voice, I shall be to him to whom I speak a barbarian; and he that speaketh, a barbarian to me.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:12": "So you also, forasmuch as you are zealous of spirits, seek to abound unto the edifying of the church.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:13": "And therefore he that speaketh by a tongue, let him pray that he may interpret.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:14": "For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is without fruit.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:15": "What is it then ? I will pray with the spirit, I will pray also with the understanding; I will sing with the spirit, I will sing also with the understanding.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:16": "Else if thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that holdeth the place of the unlearned say, Amen, to thy blessing ? because he knoweth not what thou sayest.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:17": "For thou indeed givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:18": "I thank my God I speak with all your tongues.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:19": "But in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others also; than ten thousand words in a tongue.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:20": "Brethren, do not become children in sense: but in malice be children, and in sense be perfect.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:21": "In the law it is written: In other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people; and neither so will they hear me, saith the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:22": "Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to believers, but to unbelievers; but prophecies not to unbelievers, but to believers.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:23": "If therefore the whole church come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in unlearned persons or infidels, will they not say that you are mad ?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:24": "But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or an unlearned person, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:25": "The secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so, falling down on his face, he will adore God, affirming that God is among you indeed.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:26": "How is it then, brethren ? When you come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation: let all things be done to edification.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:27": "If any speak with a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and in course, and let one interpret.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:28": "But if there be no interpreter, let him hold his peace in the church, and speak to himself and to God.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:29": "And let the prophets speak, two or three; and let the rest judge.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:30": "But if any thing be revealed to another sitting, let the first hold his peace.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:31": "For you may all prophesy one by one; that all may learn, and all may be exhorted:",
    "1 Corinthians 14:32": "And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:33": "For God is not the God of dissension, but of peace: as also I teach in all the churches of the saints.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:34": "Let women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted them to speak, but to be subject, as also the law saith.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:35": "But if they would learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:36": "Or did the word of God come out from you ? Or came it only unto you ?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:37": "If any seem to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him know the things that I write to you, that they are the commandments of the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:38": "But if any man know not, he shall not be known.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:39": "Wherefore, brethren, be zealous to prophesy; and forbid not to speak with tongues.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:40": "But let all things be done decently, and according to order.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:1": "NOW I make known unto you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received, and wherein you stand;",
    "1 Corinthians 15:2": "By which also you are saved, if you hold fast after what manner I preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:3": "For I delivered unto you first of all, which I also received: how that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures:",
    "1 Corinthians 15:4": "And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day, according to the scriptures:",
    "1 Corinthians 15:5": "And that he was seen by Cephas; and after that by the eleven.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:6": "Then he was seen by more than five hundred brethren at once: of whom many remain until this present, and some are fallen asleep.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:7": "After that, he was seen by James, then by all the apostles.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:8": "And last of all, he was seen also by me, as by one born out of due time.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:9": "For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:10": "But by the grace of God, I am what I am; and his grace in me hath not been void, but I have laboured more abundantly than all they: yet not I, but the grace of God with me.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:11": "For whether I, or they, so we preach, and so you have believed.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:12": "Now if Christ be preached, that he arose again from the dead, how do some among you say, that there is no resurrection of the dead?",
    "1 Corinthians 15:13": "But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen again.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:14": "And if Christ be not risen again, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:15": "Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God: because we have given testimony against God, that he hath raised up Christ; whom he hath not raised up, if the dead rise not again.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:16": "For if the dead rise not again, neither is Christ risen again.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:17": "And if Christ be not risen again, your faith is vain, for you are yet in your sins.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:18": "Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ, are perished.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:19": "If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:20": "But now Christ is risen from the dead, the firstfruits of them that sleep :",
    "1 Corinthians 15:21": "For by a man came death, and by a man the resurrection of the dead.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:22": "And as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:23": "But every one in his own order: the firstfruits Christ, then they that are of Christ, who have believed in his coming.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:24": "Afterwards the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God and the Father, when he shall have brought to nought all principality, and power, and virtue.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:25": "For he must reign, until he hath put all his enemies under his feet.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:26": "And the enemy death shall be destroyed last: For he hath put all things under his feet. And whereas he saith,",
    "1 Corinthians 15:27": "All things are put under him; undoubtedly, he is excepted, who put all things under him.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:28": "And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then the Son also himself shall be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:29": "Otherwise what shall they do that are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not again at all? why are they then baptized for them?",
    "1 Corinthians 15:30": "Why also are we in danger every hour?",
    "1 Corinthians 15:31": "I die daily, I protest by your glory, brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:32": "If (according to man) I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me, if the dead rise not again? Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall die.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:33": "Be not seduced: Evil communications corrupt good manners.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:34": "Awake, ye just, and sin not. For some have not the knowledge of God, I speak it to your shame.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:35": "But some man will say: How do the dead rise again? or with what manner of body shall they come?",
    "1 Corinthians 15:36": "Senseless man, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die first.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:37": "And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be; but bare grain, as of wheat, or of some of the rest.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:38": "But God giveth it a body as he will: and to every seed its proper body.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:39": "All flesh is not the same flesh: but one is the flesh of men, another of beasts, another of birds, another of fishes.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:40": "And there are bodies celestial, and bodies terrestrial: but, one is the glory of the celestial, and another of the terrestrial.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:41": "One is the glory of the sun, another the glory of the moon, and another the glory of the stars. For star differeth from star in glory.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:42": "So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it shall rise in incorruption.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:43": "It is sown in dishonour, it shall rise in glory. It is sown in weakness, it shall rise in power.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:44": "It is sown a natural body, it shall rise a spiritual body. If there be a natural body, there is also a spiritual body, as it is written:",
    "1 Corinthians 15:45": "The first man Adam was made into a living soul; the last Adam into a quickening spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:46": "Yet that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; afterwards that which is spiritual.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:47": "The first man was of the earth, earthly: the second man, from heaven, heavenly.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:48": "Such as is the earthly, such also are the earthly: and such as is the heavenly, such also are they that are heavenly.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:49": "Therefore as we have borne the image of the earthly, let us bear also the image of the heavenly.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:50": "Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot possess the kingdom of God: neither shall corruption possess incorruption.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:51": "Behold, I tell you a mystery. We shall all indeed rise again: but we shall not all be changed.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:52": "In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall rise again incorruptible: and we shall be changed.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:53": "For this corruptible must put on incorruption; and this mortal must put on immortality.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:54": "And when this mortal hath put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:55": "O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?",
    "1 Corinthians 15:56": "Now the sting of death is sin: and the power of sin is the law.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:57": "But thanks be to God, who hath given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:58": "Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast and unmoveable; always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:1": "NOW concerning the collections that are made for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, so do ye also.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:2": "On the first day of the week let every one of you put apart with himself, laying up what it shall well please him; that when I come, the collections be not then to be made.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:3": "And when I shall be with you, whomsoever you shall approve by letters, them will I send to carry your grace to Jerusalem.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:4": "And if it be meet that I also go, they shall go with me.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:5": "Now I will come to you, when I shall have passed through Macedonia. For I shall pass through Macedonia.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:6": "And with you perhaps I shall abide, or even spend the winter: that you may bring me on my way whithersoever I shall go.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:7": "For I will not see you now by the way, for I trust that I shall abide with you some time, if the Lord permit.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:8": "But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:9": "For a great door and evident is opened unto me: and many adversaries.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:10": "Now if Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear, for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:11": "Let no man therefore despise him, but conduct ye him on his way in peace: that he may come to me. For I look for him with the breatheren.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:12": "And touching our brother Apollo, I give you to understand, that I much entreated him to come unto you with the breatheren: and indeed it was not his will at all to come at this time. But he will come when he shall have leisure.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:13": "Watch ye, stand fast in the faith,do manfully, and be strengthened.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:14": "Let all your things be done in charity.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:15": "And I beseech you, brethren, you know the house of Stephanas, and of Fortunatus, and of Achaicus, that they are the firstfruits of Achaia, and have dedicated themselves to the ministry of the saints:",
    "1 Corinthians 16:16": "That you also be subject to such, and to every one that worketh with us, and laboureth.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:17": "And I rejoice in the presence of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus, because that which was wanting on your part, they have supplied.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:18": "For they have refreshed both my spirit and yours. Know them, therefore, that are such.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:19": "The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house, with whom I also lodge.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:20": "All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:21": "The salutation of me Paul, with my own hand.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:22": "If any man love not our Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema, maranatha.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:23": "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:24": "My charity be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:1": "Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother: to the church of God that is at Corinth, with all the saints that are in all Achaia:",
    "2 Corinthians 1:2": "Grace unto you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:3": "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:4": "Who comforteth us in all our tribulation; that we also may be able to comfort them who are in all distress, by the exhortation wherewith we also are exhorted by God.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:5": "For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us: so also by Christ doth our comfort abound.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:6": "Now whether we be in tribulation, it is for your exhortation and salvation: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation: or whether we be exhorted, it is for your exhortation and salvation, which worketh the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:7": "That our hope for you may be steadfast: knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the consolation.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:8": "For we would not have you ignorant,brethren, of our tribulation, which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure above our strength, so that we were weary even of life.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:9": "But we had in ourselves the answer of death, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:10": "Who hath delivered and doth deliver us out of so great dangers: in whom we trust that he will yet also deliver us.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:11": "You helping withal in prayer for us: that for this gift obtained for us, by the means of many persons, thanks may be given by many in our behalf.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:12": "For our glory is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity of heart and sincerity of God, and not in carnal wisdom, but in the grace of God, we have conversed in this world: and more abundantly towards you.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:13": "For we write no other things to you than what you have read and known. And I hope that you shall know unto the end:",
    "2 Corinthians 1:14": "As also you have known us in part, that we are your glory, as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:15": "And in this confidence I had a mind to come to you before, that you might have a second grace:",
    "2 Corinthians 1:16": "And to pass by you into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be brought on my way towards Judea.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:17": "Whereas then I was thus minded, did I use lightness? Or, the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that there should be with me, It is, and It is not?",
    "2 Corinthians 1:18": "But God is faithful, for our preaching which was to you, was not, It is, and It is not.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:19": "For the Son of God, Jesus Christ who was preached among you by us, by me, and Sylvanus, and Timothy, was not, It is and It is not, but, It is, was in him.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:20": "For all the promises of God are in him, It is; therefore also by him, amen to God, unto our glory.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:21": "Now he that confirmeth us with you in Christ, and that hath anointed us, is God:",
    "2 Corinthians 1:22": "Who also hath sealed us, and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:23": "But I call God to witness upon my soul, that to spare you, I came not any more to Corinth:",
    "2 Corinthians 1:24": "not because we exercise dominion over your faith: but we are helpers of your joy: for in faith you stand.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:1": "But I determined this with myself, not to come to you again in sorrow.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:2": "For if I make you sorrowful, who is he then that can make me glad, but the same who is made sorrowful by me?",
    "2 Corinthians 2:3": "And I wrote this same to you; that I may not, when I come, have sorrow upon sorrow, from them of whom I ought to rejoice: having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:4": "For out of much affliction and anguish of heart, I wrote to you with many tears: not that you should be made sorrowful: but that you might know the charity I have more abundantly towards you.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:5": "And if any one have caused grief, he hath not grieved me; but in part, that I may not burden you all.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:6": "To him who is such a one, this rebuke is sufficient, which is given by many:",
    "2 Corinthians 2:7": "So that on the contrary, you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:8": "Wherefore, I beseech you, that you would confirm your charity towards him.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:9": "For to this end also did I write, that I may know the experiment of you, whether you be obedient in all things.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:10": "And to whom you have pardoned any thing, I also. For, what I have pardoned, if I have pardoned any thing, for your sakes have I done it in the person of Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:11": "That we be not overreached by Satan. For we are not ignorant of his devices.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:12": "And when I was come to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened unto me in the Lord,",
    "2 Corinthians 2:13": "I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother; but bidding them farewell, I went into Macedonia.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:14": "Now thanks be to God, who always maketh us to triumph in Christ Jesus, and manifesteth the odour of his knowledge by us in every place.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:15": "For we are the good odour of Christ unto God, in them that are saved, and in them that perish.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:16": "To the one indeed the odour of death unto death: but to the others the odour of life unto life. And for these things who is so sufficient?",
    "2 Corinthians 2:17": "For we are not as many, adulterating the word of God; but with sincerity, but as from God, before God, in Christ we speak.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:1": "Do we begin again to commend ourselves? Or do we need (as some do) epistles of commendation to you, or from you?",
    "2 Corinthians 3:2": "You are our epistle, written in our hearts, which is known and read by all men:",
    "2 Corinthians 3:3": "Being manifested, that you are the epistle of Christ, ministered by us, and written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in the fleshly tables of the heart.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:4": "And such confidence we have, through Christ, towards God.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:5": "Not that we are sufficient to think any thing of ourselves, as of ourselves: but our sufficiency is from God.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:6": "Who also hath made us fit ministers of the new testament, not in the letter, but in the spirit. For the letter killeth, but the spirit quickeneth.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:7": "Now if the ministration of death, engraven with letters upon stones, was glorious; so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses, for the glory of his countenance, which is made void:",
    "2 Corinthians 3:8": "How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather in glory?",
    "2 Corinthians 3:9": "For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more the ministration of justice aboundeth in glory.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:10": "For even that which was glorious in this part was not glorified, by reason of the glory that excelleth.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:11": "For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is in glory.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:12": "Having therefore such hope, we use much confidence:",
    "2 Corinthians 3:13": "And not as Moses put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel might not steadfastly look on the face of that which is made void.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:14": "But their senses were made dull. For, until this present day, the selfsame veil, in the reading of the old testament, remaineth not taken away (because in Christ it is made void).",
    "2 Corinthians 3:15": "But even until this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:16": "But when they shall be converted to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:17": "Now the Lord is a Spirit. And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:18": "But we all beholding the glory of the Lord with open face, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:1": "Therefore, seeing we have this ministration, according as we have obtained mercy, we faint not;",
    "2 Corinthians 4:2": "But we renounce the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor adulterating the word of God; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every manâ€™s conscience, in the sight of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:3": "And if our gospel be also hid, it is hid to them that are lost,",
    "2 Corinthians 4:4": "In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of unbelievers, that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine unto them.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:5": "For we preach not ourselves, but Jesus Christ our Lord; and ourselves your servants through Jesus.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:6": "For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Christ Jesus.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:7": "But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency may be of the power of God, and not of us.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:8": "In all things we suffer tribulation, but are not distressed; we are straitened, but are not destitute;",
    "2 Corinthians 4:9": "We suffer persecution, but are not forsaken; we are cast down, but we perish not:",
    "2 Corinthians 4:10": "Always bearing about in our body the mortification of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our bodies.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:11": "For we who live are always delivered unto death for Jesusâ€™ sake; that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:12": "So then death worketh in us, but life in you.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:13": "But having the same spirit of faith, as it is written: I believed, for which cause I have spoken; we also believe, for which cause we speak also:",
    "2 Corinthians 4:14": "Knowing that he who raised up Jesus, will raise us up also with Jesus, and place us with you.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:15": "For all things are for your sakes; that the grace abounding through many, may abound in thanksgiving unto the glory of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:16": "For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man is corrupted, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:17": "For that which is at present momentary and light of our tribulation, worketh for us above measure exceedingly an eternal weight of glory.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:18": "While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen, are temporal; but the things which are not seen, are eternal.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:1": "For we know, if our earthly house of this habitation be dissolved, that we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in heaven.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:2": "For in this also we groan, desiring to be clothed upon with our habitation that is from heaven.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:3": "Yet so that we be found clothed, not naked.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:4": "For we also, who are in this tabernacle, do groan, being burthened; because we would not be unclothed, but clothed upon, that that which is mortal may be swallowed up by life.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:5": "Now he that maketh us for this very thing, is God, who hath given us the pledge of the Spirit.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:6": "Therefore having always confidence, knowing that, while we are in the body, we are absent from the Lord.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:7": "(For we walk by faith, and not by sight.)",
    "2 Corinthians 5:8": "But we are confident, and have a good will to be absent rather from the body, and to be present with the Lord.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:9": "And therefore we labour, whether absent or present, to please him.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:10": "For we must all be manifested before the judgement seat of Christ, that every one may receive the proper things of the body, according as he hath done, whether it be good or evil.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:11": "Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we use persuasion to men; but to God we are manifest. And I trust also that in your consciences we are manifest.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:12": "We commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory in our behalf; that you may have somewhat to answer them who glory in face, and not in heart.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:13": "For whether we be transported in mind, it is to God; or whether we be sober, it is for you.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:14": "For the charity of Christ presseth us: judging this, that if one died for all, then all were dead.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:15": "And Christ died for all; that they also who live, may not now live to themselves, but unto him who died for them, and rose again.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:16": "Wherefore henceforth, we know no man according to the flesh. And if we have known Christ according to the flesh; but now we know him so no longer.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:17": "If then any be in Christ a new creature, the old things are passed away, behold all things are made new.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:18": "But all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Christ; and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:19": "For God indeed was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing to them their sins; and he hath placed in us the word of reconciliation.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:20": "For Christ therefore we are ambassadors, God as it were exhorting by us. For Christ, we beseech you, be reconciled to God.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:21": "Him, who knew no sin, he hath made sin for us, that we might be made the justice of God in him.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:1": "And we helping do exhort you, that you receive not the grace of God in vain.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:2": "For he saith: In an accepted time have I heard thee; and in the day of salvation have I helped thee. Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:3": "Giving no offence to any man, that our ministry be not blamed:",
    "2 Corinthians 6:4": "But in all things let us exhibit ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in tribulation, in necessities, in distresses,",
    "2 Corinthians 6:5": "In stripes, in prisons, in seditions, in labours, in watchings, in fastings,",
    "2 Corinthians 6:6": "In chastity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in sweetness, in the Holy Ghost, in charity unfeigned,",
    "2 Corinthians 6:7": "In the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armour of justice on the right hand and on the left;",
    "2 Corinthians 6:8": "By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet known;",
    "2 Corinthians 6:9": "As dying, and behold we live; as chastised, and not killed;",
    "2 Corinthians 6:10": "As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as needy, yet enriching many; as having nothing, and possessing all things.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:11": "Our mouth is open to you, O ye Corinthians, our heart is enlarged.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:12": "You are not straitened in us, but in your own bowels you are straitened.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:13": "But having the same recompense, (I speak as to my children,) be you also enlarged.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:14": "Bear not the yoke with unbelievers. For what participation hath justice with injustice? Or what fellowship hath light with darkness?",
    "2 Corinthians 6:15": "And what concord hath Christ with Belial? Or what part hath the faithful with the unbeliever?",
    "2 Corinthians 6:16": "And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God; as God saith: I will dwell in them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:17": "Wherefore, Go out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing:",
    "2 Corinthians 6:18": "And I will receive you; and I will be a Father to you; and you shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:1": "Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of the flesh and of the spirit, perfecting sactification in the fear of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:2": "Receive us. We have injured no man, we have corrupted no man, we have overreached no man.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:3": "I speak not this to your condemnation. For we have said before, that you are in our hearts, to die together, and to live together.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:4": "Great is my confidence for you, great is my glorying for you. I am filled with comfort: I exceedingly abound with joy in all our tribulation.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:5": "For also when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we suffered all tribulation; combats without, fears within.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:6": "But God, who comforteth the humble, comforted us by the coming of Titus.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:7": "And not by his coming only, but also by the consolation, wherewith he was comforted in you, relating to us your desire, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced the more.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:8": "For although I made you sorrowful by my epistle, I do not repent; and if I did repent, seeing that the same epistle (although but for a time) did make you sorrowful;",
    "2 Corinthians 7:9": "Now I am glad: not because you were made sorrowful; but because you were made sorrowful unto penance. For you were made sorrowful according to God, that you might suffer damage by us in nothing.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:10": "For the sorrow that is according to God worketh penance, steadfast unto salvation; but the sorrow of the world worketh death.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:11": "For behold this selfsame thing, that you were made sorrowful according to God, how great carefulness it worketh in you; yea defence, yea indignation, yea fear, yea desire, yea zeal, yea revenge: in all things you have shewed yourselves to be undefiled in the matter.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:12": "Wherefore although I wrote to you, it was not for his sake that I did the wrong, nor for him that suffered it; but to manifest our carefulness that we have for you",
    "2 Corinthians 7:13": "Before God: therefore we were comforted. But in our consolation, we did the more abundantly rejoice for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:14": "And if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I have not been put to shame; but as we have spoken all things to you in truth, so also our boasting that was made to Titus is found a truth.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:15": "And his bowels are more abundantly towards you; remembering the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you have received him.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:16": "I rejoice that in all things I have confidence in you.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:1": "Now we make known unto you, brethren, the grace of God, that hath been given in the churches of Macedonia.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:2": "That in much experience of tribulation, they have had abundance of joy; and their very deep poverty hath abounded unto the riches of their simplicity.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:3": "For according to their power ( I bear them witness), and beyond their power, they were willing.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:4": "With much entreaty begging of us the grace and communication of the ministry that is done toward the saints.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:5": "And not as we hoped, but they gave their own selves first to the Lord, then to us by the will of God:",
    "2 Corinthians 8:6": "Insomuch, that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so also he would finish among you this same grace.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:7": "That as in all things you abound in faith, and word, and knowledge, and all carefulness; moreover also in your charity towards us, so in this grace also you may abound.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:8": "I speak not as commanding; but by the carefulness of others, approving also the good disposition of your charity.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:9": "For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that being rich he became poor, for your sakes; that through his poverty you might be rich.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:10": "And herein I give my advice; for this is profitable for you, who have begun not only to do, but also to be willing, a year ago.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:11": "Now therefore perform ye it also in deed; that as your mind is forward to be willing, so it may be also to perform, out of that which you have.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:12": "For if the will be forward, it is accepted according to that which a man hath, not according to that which he hath not.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:13": "For I mean not that others should be eased, and you burthened, but by an equality.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:14": "In this present time let your abundance supply their want, that their abundance also may supply your want, that there may be an equality,",
    "2 Corinthians 8:15": "As it is written: He that had much, had nothing over; and he that had little, had no want.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:16": "And thanks be to God, who hath given the same carefulness for you in the heart of Titus.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:17": "For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more careful, of his own will he went unto you.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:18": "We have sent also with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel through all the churches.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:19": "And not that only, but he was also ordained by the churches companion of our travels, for this grace, which is administered by us, to the glory of the Lord, and our determined will:",
    "2 Corinthians 8:20": "Avoiding this, lest any man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:21": "For we forecast what may be good not only before God, but also before men.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:22": "And we have sent with them our brother also, whom we have often proved diligent in many things; but now much more diligent, with much confidence in you,",
    "2 Corinthians 8:23": "Either for Titus, who is my companion and fellow labourer towards you, or our brethren, the apostles of the churches, the glory of Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:24": "Wherefore shew ye to them, in the sight of the churches, the evidence of your charity, and of our boasting on your behalf.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:1": "For concerning the ministry that is done towards the saints, it is superfluous for me to write unto you.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:2": "For I know your forward mind: for which I boast of you to the Macedonians. That Achaia also is ready from the year past, and your emulation hath provoked very many.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:3": "Now I have sent the brethren, that the thing which we boast of concerning you, be not made void in this behalf, that (as I have said) you may be ready:",
    "2 Corinthians 9:4": "Lest, when the Macedonians shall come with me, and find you unprepared, we (not to say ye) should be ashamed in this matter.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:5": "Therefore I thought it necessary to desire the brethren that they would go to you before, and prepare this blessing before promised, to be ready, so as a blessing, not as covetousness.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:6": "Now this I say: He who soweth sparingly, shall also reap sparingly: and he who soweth in blessings, shall also reap blessings.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:7": "Every one as he hath determined in his heart, not with sadness, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:8": "And God is able to make all grace abound in you; that ye always, having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work,",
    "2 Corinthians 9:9": "As it is written: He hath dispersed abroad, he hath given to the poor: his justice remaineth for ever.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:10": "And he that ministereth seed to the sower, will both give you bread to eat, and will multiply your seed, and increase the growth of the fruits of your justice:",
    "2 Corinthians 9:11": "That being enriched in all things, you may abound unto all simplicity, which worketh through us thanksgiving to God.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:12": "Because the administration of this office doth not only supply the want of the saints, but aboundeth also by many thanksgivings in the Lord,",
    "2 Corinthians 9:13": "By the proof of this ministry, glorifying God for the obedience of your confession unto the gospel of Christ, and for the simplicity of your communicating unto them, and unto all.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:14": "And in their praying for you, being desirous of you, because of the excellent grace of God in you.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:15": "Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:1": "Now I Paul myself beseech you, by the mildness and modesty of Christ, who in presence indeed am lowly among you, but being absent, am bold toward you.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:2": "But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present, with that confidence wherewith I am thought to be bold, against some, who reckon us as if we walked according to the flesh.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:3": "For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:4": "For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty to God unto the pulling down of fortifications, destroying counsels,",
    "2 Corinthians 10:5": "And every height that exhalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of Christ;",
    "2 Corinthians 10:6": "And having in readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be fulfilled.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:7": "See the things that are according to outward appearance. If any man trust to himself, that he is Christâ€™s, let him think this again with himself, that as he is Christâ€™s, so are we also.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:8": "For if also I should boast somewhat more of our power, which the Lord hath given us unto edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:9": "But that I may not be thought as it were to terrify you by epistles,",
    "2 Corinthians 10:10": "(For his epistles indeed, say they, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible,)",
    "2 Corinthians 10:11": "Let such a one think this, that such as we are in word by epistles, when absent, such also we will be indeed when present.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:12": "For we dare not match, or compare ourselves with some, that commend themselves; but we measure ourselves by ourselves, and compare ourselves with ourselves.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:13": "But we will not glory beyond our measure; but according to the measure of the rule, which God hath measured to us, a measure to reach even unto you.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:14": "For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as if we reached not unto you. For we are come as far as to you in the gospel of Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:15": "Not glorying beyond measure in other menâ€™s labours; but having hope of your increasing faith, to be magnified in you according to our rule abundantly;",
    "2 Corinthians 10:16": "Yea, unto those places that are beyond you, to preach the gospel, not to glory in another manâ€™s rule, in those things that are made ready to our hand.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:17": "But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:18": "For not he who commendeth himself, is approved, but he, whom God commendeth.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:1": "Would to God you could bear with some little of my folly: but do bear with me.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:2": "For I am jealous of you with the jealousy of God. For I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:3": "But I fear lest, as the serpent seduced Eve by his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted, and fall from the simplicity that is in Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:4": "For if he that cometh preacheth another Christ, whom we have not preached; or if you receive another Spirit, whom you have not received; or another gospel which you have not received; you might well bear with him.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:5": "For I suppose that I have done nothing less than the great apostles.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:6": "For although I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but in all things we have been made manifest to you.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:7": "Or did I commit a fault, humbling myself, that you might be exalted? Because I preached unto you the gospel of God freely?",
    "2 Corinthians 11:8": "I have taken from other churches, receiving wages of them for your ministry.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:9": "And, when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was wanting to me, the brethren supplied who came from Macedonia; and in all things I have kept myself from being burthensome to you, and so I will keep myself.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:10": "The truth of Christ is in me, that this glorying shall not be broken off in me in the regions of Achaia.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:11": "Wherefore? Because I love you not? God knoweth it.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:12": "But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off the occasion from them that desire occasion, that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:13": "For such false apostles are deceitful workmen, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:14": "And no wonder: for Satan himself transformeth himself into an angel of light.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:15": "Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers be transformed as the ministers of justice, whose end shall be according to their works.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:16": "I say again, (let no man think me to be foolish, otherwise take me as one foolish, that I also may glory a little.)",
    "2 Corinthians 11:17": "That which I speak, I speak not according to God, but as it were in foolishness, in this matter of glorying.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:18": "Seeing that many glory according to the flesh, I will glory also.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:19": "For you gladly suffer the foolish; whereas yourselves are wise.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:20": "For you suffer if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take from you, if a man be lifted up, if a man strike you on the face.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:21": "I speak according to dishonour, as if we had been weak in this part. Wherein if any man dare (I speak foolishly), I dare also.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:22": "They are Hebrews: so am I. They are Israelites: so am I. They are the seed of Abraham: so am I.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:23": "They are the ministers of Christ (I speak as one less wise): I am more; in many more labours, in prisons more frequently, in stripes above measure, in deaths often.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:24": "Of the Jews five times did I receive forty stripes, save one.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:25": "Thrice was I beaten with rods, once I was stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I was in the depth of the sea.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:26": "In journeying often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils from my own nation, in perils from the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils from false brethren.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:27": "In labour and painfulness, in much watchings, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:28": "Besides those things which are without: my daily instance, the solicitude for all the churches.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:29": "Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is scandalized, and I am not on fire?",
    "2 Corinthians 11:30": "If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things that concern my infirmity.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:31": "The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for ever, knoweth that I lie not.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:32": "At Damascus, the governor of the nation under Aretas the king, guarded the city of the Damascenes, to apprehend me.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:33": "And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and so escaped his hands.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:1": "If I must glory (it is not expedient indeed): but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:2": "I know a man in Christ above fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not, or out of the body, I know not; God knoweth), such a one caught up to the third heaven.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:3": "And I know such a man (whether in the body, or out of the body, I know not: God knoweth):",
    "2 Corinthians 12:4": "That he was caught up into paradise, and heard secret words, which it is not granted to man to utter.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:5": "For such an one I will glory; but for myself I will glory nothing, but in my infirmities.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:6": "For though I should have a mind to glory, I shall not be foolish; for I will say the truth. But I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth in me, or any thing he heareth from me.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:7": "And lest the greatness of the revelations should exalt me, there was given me a sting of my flesh, an angel of Satan, to buffet me.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:8": "For which thing thrice I besought the Lord, that it might depart from me.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:9": "And he said to me: My grace is sufficient for thee; for power is made perfect in infirmity. Gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may dwell in me.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:10": "For which cause I please myself in my infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ. For when I am weak, then am I powerful.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:11": "I am become foolish: you have compelled me. For I ought to have been commended by you: for I have no way come short of them that are above measure apostles, although I be nothing.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:12": "Yet the signs of my apostleship have been wrought on you, in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:13": "For what is there that you have had less than the other churches, but that I myself was not burthensome to you? Pardon me this injury.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:14": "Behold now the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burthensome unto you. For I seek not the things that are yours, but you. For neither ought the children to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:15": "But I most gladly will spend and be spent myself for your souls; although loving you more, I be loved less.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:16": "But be it so: I did not burthen you: but being crafty, I caught you by guile.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:17": "Did I overreach you by any of them whom I sent to you?",
    "2 Corinthians 12:18": "I desired Titus, and I sent with him a brother. Did Titus overreach you? Did we not walk with the same spirit? did we not in the same steps?",
    "2 Corinthians 12:19": "Of old, think you that we excuse ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ; but all things, my dearly beloved, for your edification.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:20": "For I fear lest perhaps when I come I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found by you such as you would not. Lest perhaps contentions, envyings, animosities, dissensions, detractions, whisperings, swellings, seditions, be among you.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:21": "Lest again, when I come, God humble me among you: and I mourn many of them that sinned before, and have not done penance for the uncleanness, and fornication, and lasciviousness, that they have committed.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:1": "Behold, this is the third time I am coming to you: In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word stand.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:2": "I have told before, and foretell, as present, and now absent, to them that sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:3": "Do you seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me, who towards you is not weak, but is mighty in you?",
    "2 Corinthians 13:4": "For although he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him: but we shall live with him by the power of God towards you.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:5": "Try your own selves if you be in the faith; prove ye yourselves. Know you not your own selves, that Christ Jesus is in you, unless perhaps you be reprobates?",
    "2 Corinthians 13:6": "But I trust that you shall know that we are not reprobates.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:7": "Now we pray God, that you may do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that you may do that which is good, and that we may be as reprobates.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:8": "For we can do nothing against the truth; but for the truth.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:9": "For we rejoice that we are weak, and you are strong. This also we pray for, your perfection.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:10": "Therefore I write these things, being absent, that, being present, I may not deal more severely, according to the power which the Lord hath given me unto edification, and not unto destruction.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:11": "For the rest, brethren, rejoice, be perfect, take exhortation, be of one mind, have peace; and the God of peace and of love shall be with you.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:12": "Salute one another with a holy kiss.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:13": "All the saints salute you.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:14": "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the charity of God, and the communication of the Holy Ghost be with you all. Amen.",
    "Galatians 1:1": "Paul, an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead,",
    "Galatians 1:2": "And all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia.",
    "Galatians 1:3": "Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,",
    "Galatians 1:4": "Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present wicked world, according to the will of God and our Father:",
    "Galatians 1:5": "To whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.",
    "Galatians 1:6": "I wonder that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, unto another gospel.",
    "Galatians 1:7": "Which is not another, only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.",
    "Galatians 1:8": "But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you besides that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema.",
    "Galatians 1:9": "As we said before, so now I say again: If any one preach to you a gospel, besides that which you have received, let him be anathema.",
    "Galatians 1:10": "For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.",
    "Galatians 1:11": "For I give you to understand, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.",
    "Galatians 1:12": "For neither did I receive it of man, nor did I learn it; but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.",
    "Galatians 1:13": "For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jewsâ€™ religion: how that, beyond measure, I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it.",
    "Galatians 1:14": "And I made progress in the Jewsâ€™ religion above many of my equals in my own nation, being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.",
    "Galatians 1:15": "But when it pleased him, who separated me from my motherâ€™s womb, and called me by his grace,",
    "Galatians 1:16": "To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, immediately I condescended not to flesh and blood.",
    "Galatians 1:17": "Neither went I to Jerusalem, to the apostles who were before me: but I went into Arabia, and again I returned to Damascus.",
    "Galatians 1:18": "Then, after three years, I went to Jerusalem, to see Peter, and I tarried with him fifteen days.",
    "Galatians 1:19": "But other of the apostles I saw none, saving James the brother of the Lord.",
    "Galatians 1:20": "Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not.",
    "Galatians 1:21": "Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.",
    "Galatians 1:22": "And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which were in Christ:",
    "Galatians 1:23": "But they had heard only: He, who persecuted us in times past, doth now preach the faith which once he impugned:",
    "Galatians 1:24": "And they glorified God in me.",
    "Galatians 2:1": "Then, after fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.",
    "Galatians 2:2": "And I went up according to revelation; and communicated to them the gospel, which I preach among the Gentiles, but apart to them who seemed to be some thing: lest perhaps I should run, or had run in vain.",
    "Galatians 2:3": "But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Gentile, was compelled to be circumcised.",
    "Galatians 2:4": "But because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privately to spy our liberty, which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into servitude.",
    "Galatians 2:5": "To whom we yielded not by subjection, no not for an hour, that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.",
    "Galatians 2:6": "But of them who seemed to be some thing, (what they were some time, it is nothing to me, God accepteth not the person of man,) for to me they that seemed to be some thing added nothing.",
    "Galatians 2:7": "But contrariwise, when they had seen that to me was committed the gospel of the uncircumcision, as to Peter was that of the circumcision.",
    "Galatians 2:8": "(For he who wrought in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, wrought in me also among the Gentiles.)",
    "Galatians 2:9": "And when they had known the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship: that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision:",
    "Galatians 2:10": "Only that we should be mindful of the poor: which same thing also I was careful to do.",
    "Galatians 2:11": "But when Cephas was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.",
    "Galatians 2:12": "For before that some came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them who were of the circumcision.",
    "Galatians 2:13": "And to his dissimulation the rest of the Jews consented, so that Barnabas also was led by them into that dissimulation.",
    "Galatians 2:14": "But when I saw that they walked not uprightly unto the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all: If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as the Jews do, how dost thou compel the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?",
    "Galatians 2:15": "We by nature are Jews, and not of the Gentiles sinners.",
    "Galatians 2:16": "But knowing that man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ; we also believe in Christ Jesus, that we may be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.",
    "Galatians 2:17": "But if while we seek to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners; is Christ then the minister of sin? God forbid.",
    "Galatians 2:18": "For if I build up again the things which I have destroyed, I make myself a prevaricator.",
    "Galatians 2:19": "For I, through the law, am dead to the law, that I may live to God: with Christ I am nailed to the cross.",
    "Galatians 2:20": "And I live, now not I; but Christ liveth in me. And that I live now in the flesh: I live in the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and delivered himself for me.",
    "Galatians 2:21": "I cast not away the grace of God. For if justice be by the law, then Christ died in vain.",
    "Galatians 3:1": "O senseless Galatians, who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been set forth, crucified among you?",
    "Galatians 3:2": "This only would I learn of you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?",
    "Galatians 3:3": "Are you so foolish, that, whereas you began in the Spirit, you would now be made perfect by the flesh?",
    "Galatians 3:4": "Have you suffered so great things in vain? If it be yet in vain.",
    "Galatians 3:5": "He therefore who giveth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you; doth he do it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of the faith?",
    "Galatians 3:6": "As it is written: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.",
    "Galatians 3:7": "Know ye therefore, that they who are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.",
    "Galatians 3:8": "And the scripture, foreseeing, that God justifieth the Gentiles by faith, told unto Abraham before: In thee shall all nations be blessed.",
    "Galatians 3:9": "Therefore they that are of faith, shall be blessed with faithful Abraham.",
    "Galatians 3:10": "For as many as are of the works of the law, are under a curse. For it is written: Cursed is every one, that abideth not in all things, which are written in the book of the law to do them.",
    "Galatians 3:11": "But that in the law no man is justified with God, it is manifest: because the just man liveth by faith.",
    "Galatians 3:12": "But the law is not of faith: but, He that doth those things, shall live in them.",
    "Galatians 3:13": "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written: Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:",
    "Galatians 3:14": "That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus: that we may receive the promise of the Spirit by faith.",
    "Galatians 3:15": "Brethren (I speak after the manner of man,) yet a manâ€™s testament, if it be confirmed, no man despiseth, nor addeth to it.",
    "Galatians 3:16": "To Abraham were the promises made and to his seed. He saith not, And to his seeds, as of many: but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.",
    "Galatians 3:17": "Now this I say, that the testament which was confirmed by God, the law which was made after four hundred and thirty years, doth not disannul, to make the promise of no effect.",
    "Galatians 3:18": "For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise. But God gave it to Abraham by promise.",
    "Galatians 3:19": "Why then was the law? It was set because of transgressions, until the seed should come, to whom he made the promise, being ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.",
    "Galatians 3:20": "Now a mediator is not of one: but God is one.",
    "Galatians 3:21": "Was the law then against the promises of God? God forbid. For if there had been a law given which could give life, verily justice should have been by the law.",
    "Galatians 3:22": "But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise, by the faith of Jesus Christ, might be given to them that believe.",
    "Galatians 3:23": "But before the faith came, we were kept under the law shut up, unto that faith which was to be revealed.",
    "Galatians 3:24": "Wherefore the law was our pedagogue in Christ, that we might be justified by faith.",
    "Galatians 3:25": "But after the faith is come, we are no longer under a pedagogue.",
    "Galatians 3:26": "For you are all the children of God by faith, in Christ Jesus.",
    "Galatians 3:27": "For as many of you as have been baptized in Christ, have put on Christ.",
    "Galatians 3:28": "There is neither Jew nor Greek: there is neither bond nor free: there is neither male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus.",
    "Galatians 3:29": "And if you be Christâ€™s, then are you the seed of Abraham, heirs according to the promise.",
    "Galatians 4:1": "Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;",
    "Galatians 4:2": "But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father:",
    "Galatians 4:3": "So we also, when we were children, were serving under the elements of the world.",
    "Galatians 4:4": "But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent his Son, made of a woman, made under the law:",
    "Galatians 4:5": "That he might redeem them who were under the law: that we might receive the adoption of sons.",
    "Galatians 4:6": "And because you are sons, God hath sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying: Abba, Father.",
    "Galatians 4:7": "Therefore now he is not a servant, but a son. And if a son, an heir also through God.",
    "Galatians 4:8": "But then indeed, not knowing God, you served them, who, by nature, are not gods.",
    "Galatians 4:9": "But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known by God: how turn you again to the weak and needy elements, which you desire to serve again?",
    "Galatians 4:10": "You observe days, and months, and times, and years.",
    "Galatians 4:11": "I am afraid of you, lest perhaps I have laboured in vain among you.",
    "Galatians 4:12": "Be ye as I, because I also am as you: brethren, I beseech you: you have not injured me at all.",
    "Galatians 4:13": "And you know, how through infirmity of the flesh, I preached the gospel to you heretofore: and your temptation in my flesh,",
    "Galatians 4:14": "You despised not, nor rejected: but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.",
    "Galatians 4:15": "Where is then your blessedness? For I bear you witness, that, if it could be done, you would have plucked out your own eyes, and would have given them to me.",
    "Galatians 4:16": "Am I then become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?",
    "Galatians 4:17": "They are zealous in your regard not well: but they would exclude you, that you might be zealous for them.",
    "Galatians 4:18": "But be zealous for that which is good in a good thing always: and not only when I am present with you.",
    "Galatians 4:19": "My little children, of whom I am in labour again, until Christ be formed in you.",
    "Galatians 4:20": "And I would willingly be present with you now, and change my voice: because I am ashamed for you.",
    "Galatians 4:21": "Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, have you not read the law?",
    "Galatians 4:22": "For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, and the other by a free woman.",
    "Galatians 4:23": "But he who was of the bondwoman, was born according to the flesh: but he of the free woman, was by promise.",
    "Galatians 4:24": "Which things are said by an allegory. For these are the two testaments. The one from mount Sina, engendering unto bondage; which is Agar:",
    "Galatians 4:25": "For Sina is a mountain in Arabia, which hath affinity to that Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.",
    "Galatians 4:26": "But that Jerusalem, which is above, is free: which is our mother.",
    "Galatians 4:27": "For it is written: Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not: break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for many are the children of the desolate, more than of her that hath a husband.",
    "Galatians 4:28": "Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.",
    "Galatians 4:29": "But as then he, that was born according to the flesh, persecuted him that was after the spirit; so also it is now.",
    "Galatians 4:30": "But what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son; for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman.",
    "Galatians 4:31": "So then, brethren, we are not the children of the bondwoman, but of the free: by the freedom wherewith Christ has made us free.",
    "Galatians 5:1": "Stand fast, and be not held again under the yoke of bondage.",
    "Galatians 5:2": "Behold, I Paul tell you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.",
    "Galatians 5:3": "And I testify again to every man circumcising himself, that he is a debtor to the whole law.",
    "Galatians 5:4": "You are made void of Christ, you who are justified in the law: you are fallen from grace.",
    "Galatians 5:5": "For we in spirit, by faith, wait for the hope of justice.",
    "Galatians 5:6": "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision: but faith that worketh by charity.",
    "Galatians 5:7": "You did run well, who hath hindered you, that you should not obey the truth?",
    "Galatians 5:8": "This persuasion is not from him that calleth you.",
    "Galatians 5:9": "A little leaven corrupteth the whole lump.",
    "Galatians 5:10": "I have confidence in you in the Lord: that you will not be of another mind: but he that troubleth you, shall bear the judgment, whosoever he be.",
    "Galatians 5:11": "And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? Then is the scandal of the cross made void.",
    "Galatians 5:12": "I would they were even cut off, who trouble you.",
    "Galatians 5:13": "For you, brethren, have been called unto liberty: only make not liberty an occasion to the flesh, but by charity of the spirit serve one another.",
    "Galatians 5:14": "For all the law is fulfilled in one word: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.",
    "Galatians 5:15": "But if you bite and devour one another; take heed you be not consumed one of another.",
    "Galatians 5:16": "I say then, walk in the spirit, and you shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh.",
    "Galatians 5:17": "For the flesh lusteth against the spirit: and the spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary one to another: so that you do not the things that you would.",
    "Galatians 5:18": "But if you are led by the spirit, you are not under the law.",
    "Galatians 5:19": "Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are fornication, uncleanness, immodesty, luxury,",
    "Galatians 5:20": "Idolatry, witchcrafts, enmities, contentions, emulations, wraths, quarrels, dissensions, sects,",
    "Galatians 5:21": "Envies, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like. Of the which I foretell you, as I have foretold to you, that they who do such things shall not obtain the kingdom of God.",
    "Galatians 5:22": "But the fruit of the Spirit is, charity, joy, peace, patience, benignity, goodness, longanimity,",
    "Galatians 5:23": "Mildness, faith, modesty, continency, chastity. Against such there is no law.",
    "Galatians 5:24": "And they that are Christâ€™s, have crucified their flesh, with the vices and concupiscences.",
    "Galatians 5:25": "If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.",
    "Galatians 5:26": "Let us not be made desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying on another.",
    "Galatians 6:1": "Brethren, and if a man be overtaken in any fault, you, who are spiritual, instruct such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.",
    "Galatians 6:2": "Bear ye one anotherâ€™s burdens; and so you shall fulfil the law of Christ.",
    "Galatians 6:3": "For if any man think himself to be some thing, whereas he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.",
    "Galatians 6:4": "But let every one prove his own work, and so he shall have glory in himself only, and not in another.",
    "Galatians 6:5": "For every one shall bear his own burden.",
    "Galatians 6:6": "And let him that is instructed in the word, communicate to him that instructeth him, in all good things.",
    "Galatians 6:7": "Be not deceived, God is not mocked.",
    "Galatians 6:8": "For what things a man shall sow, those also shall he reap. For he that soweth in his flesh, of the flesh also shall reap corruption. But he that soweth in the spirit, of the spirit shall reap life everlasting.",
    "Galatians 6:9": "And in doing good, let us not fail. For in due time we shall reap, not failing.",
    "Galatians 6:10": "Therefore, whilst we have time, let us work good to all men, but especially to those who are of the household of the faith.",
    "Galatians 6:11": "See what a letter I have written to you with my own hand.",
    "Galatians 6:12": "For as many as desire to please in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer the persecution of the cross of Christ.",
    "Galatians 6:13": "For neither they themselves who are circumcised, keep the law; but they will have you to be circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.",
    "Galatians 6:14": "But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ; by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.",
    "Galatians 6:15": "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.",
    "Galatians 6:16": "And whosoever shall follow this rule, peace on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.",
    "Galatians 6:17": "From henceforth let no man be troublesome to me; for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus in my body.",
    "Galatians 6:18": "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.",
    "Ephesians 1:1": "Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, to all the saints who are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus.",
    "Ephesians 1:2": "Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "Ephesians 1:3": "Blessed by the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with spiritual blessings in heavenly places, in Christ:",
    "Ephesians 1:4": "As he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and unspotted in his sight in charity.",
    "Ephesians 1:5": "Who hath predestinated us unto the adoption of children through Jesus Christ unto himself: according to the purpose of his will:",
    "Ephesians 1:6": "Unto the praise of the glory of his grace, in which he hath graced us in his beloved son.",
    "Ephesians 1:7": "In whom we have redemption through his blood, the remission of sins, according to the riches of his grace,",
    "Ephesians 1:8": "Which hath superabounded in us in all wisdom and prudence,",
    "Ephesians 1:9": "That he might make known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in him,",
    "Ephesians 1:10": "In the dispensation of the fulness of times, to re-establish all things in Christ, that are in heaven and on earth, in him.",
    "Ephesians 1:11": "In whom we also are called by lot, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things according to the counsel of his will.",
    "Ephesians 1:12": "That we may be unto the praise of his glory, we who before hoped Christ:",
    "Ephesians 1:13": "In whom you also, after you had heard the word of truth, (the gospel of your salvation;) in whom also believing, you were signed with the holy Spirit of promise,",
    "Ephesians 1:14": "Who is the pledge of our inheritance, unto the redemption of acquisition, unto the praise of his glory.",
    "Ephesians 1:15": "Wherefore I also, hearing of your faith that is in the Lord Jesus, and of your love towards all the saints,",
    "Ephesians 1:16": "Cease not to give thanks for you, making commemoration of you in my prayers,",
    "Ephesians 1:17": "That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and of revelation, in the knowledge of him:",
    "Ephesians 1:18": "The eyes of your heart enlightened, that you may know what the hope is of the glory of his inheritance in the saints.",
    "Ephesians 1:19": "And what is the exceeding greatness of his power towards us, who believe according to the operation of the might of his power,",
    "Ephesians 1:20": "Which he wrought in Christ, raising him up from the dead, and setting him on his right hand in the heavenly places.",
    "Ephesians 1:21": "Above all principality, and power, and virtue, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come.",
    "Ephesians 1:22": "And he hath subjected all things under his feet, and hath made him head over all the church,",
    "Ephesians 1:23": "Which is his body, and the fulness of him who is filled all in all.",
    "Ephesians 2:1": "And you, when you were dead in your offences, and sins,",
    "Ephesians 2:2": "Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of this air, of the spirit that now worketh on the children of unbelief:",
    "Ephesians 2:3": "In which also we all conversed in time past, in the desires of our flesh, fulfilling the will of the flesh and of our thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest:",
    "Ephesians 2:4": "But God, (who is rich in mercy,) for his exceeding charity wherewith he loved us,",
    "Ephesians 2:5": "Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together in Christ, (by whose grace you are saved,)",
    "Ephesians 2:6": "And hath raised us up together, and hath made us sit together in the heavenly places, through Christ Jesus.",
    "Ephesians 2:7": "That he might shew in the ages to come the abundant riches of his grace, in his bounty towards us in Christ Jesus.",
    "Ephesians 2:8": "For by grace you are saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, for it is the gift of God;",
    "Ephesians 2:9": "Not of works, that no man may glory.",
    "Ephesians 2:10": "For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus in good works, which God hath prepared that we should walk in them.",
    "Ephesians 2:11": "For which cause be mindful that you, being heretofore Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision in the flesh, made by hands;",
    "Ephesians 2:12": "That you were at that time without Christ, being aliens from the conversation of Israel, and strangers to the testament, having no hope of the promise, and without God in this world.",
    "Ephesians 2:13": "But now in Christ Jesus, you, who some time were afar off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ.",
    "Ephesians 2:14": "For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and breaking down the middle wall of partition, the enmities in his flesh:",
    "Ephesians 2:15": "Making void the law of commandments contained in decrees; that he might make the two in himself into one new man, making peace;",
    "Ephesians 2:16": "And might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, killing the enmities in himself.",
    "Ephesians 2:17": "And coming, he preached peace to you that were afar off, and peace to them that were nigh.",
    "Ephesians 2:18": "For by him we have access both in one Spirit to the Father.",
    "Ephesians 2:19": "Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners; but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and the domestics of God,",
    "Ephesians 2:20": "Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone:",
    "Ephesians 2:21": "In whom all the building, being framed together, groweth up into an holy temple in the Lord.",
    "Ephesians 2:22": "In whom you also are built together into an habitation of God in the Spirit.",
    "Ephesians 3:1": "For this cause, I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ, for you Gentiles;",
    "Ephesians 3:2": "If yet you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me towards you:",
    "Ephesians 3:3": "How that, according to revelation, the mystery has been made known to me, as I have written above in a few words;",
    "Ephesians 3:4": "As you reading, may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ,",
    "Ephesians 3:5": "Which in other generations was not known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit:",
    "Ephesians 3:6": "That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and co-partners of his promise in Christ Jesus, by the gospel:",
    "Ephesians 3:7": "Of which I am made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God, which is given to me according to the operation of his power:",
    "Ephesians 3:8": "To me, the least of all the saints, is given this grace, to preach among the Gentiles, the unsearchable riches of Christ,",
    "Ephesians 3:9": "And to enlighten all men, that they may see what is the dispensation of the mystery which hath been hidden from eternity in God, who created all things:",
    "Ephesians 3:10": "That the manifold wisdom of God may be made known to the principalities and powers in heavenly places through the church,",
    "Ephesians 3:11": "According to the eternal purpose, which he made, in Christ Jesus our Lord:",
    "Ephesians 3:12": "In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.",
    "Ephesians 3:13": "Wherefore I pray you not to faint at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.",
    "Ephesians 3:14": "For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,",
    "Ephesians 3:15": "Of whom all paternity in heaven and earth is named,",
    "Ephesians 3:16": "That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened by his Spirit with might unto the inward man,",
    "Ephesians 3:17": "That Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts; that being rooted and founded in charity,",
    "Ephesians 3:18": "You may be able to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth, and length, and height, and depth:",
    "Ephesians 3:19": "To know also the charity of Christ, which surpasseth all knowledge, that you may be filled unto all the fulness of God.",
    "Ephesians 3:20": "Now to him who is able to do all things more abundantly than we desire or understand, according to the power that worketh in us;",
    "Ephesians 3:21": "To him be glory in the church, and in Christ Jesus unto all generations, world without end. Amen.",
    "Ephesians 4:1": "I therefore, a prisoner in the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation in which you are called,",
    "Ephesians 4:2": "With all humility and mildness, with patience, supporting one another in charity.",
    "Ephesians 4:3": "Careful to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.",
    "Ephesians 4:4": "One body and one Spirit; as you are called in one hope of your calling.",
    "Ephesians 4:5": "One Lord, one faith, one baptism.",
    "Ephesians 4:6": "One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in us all.",
    "Ephesians 4:7": "But to every one of us is given grace, according to the measure of the giving of Christ.",
    "Ephesians 4:8": "Wherefore he saith: Ascending on high, he led captivity captive; he gave gifts to men.",
    "Ephesians 4:9": "Now that he ascended, what is it, but because he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?",
    "Ephesians 4:10": "He that descended is the same also that ascended above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.",
    "Ephesians 4:11": "And he gave some apostles, and some prophets, and other some evangelists, and other some pastors and doctors,",
    "Ephesians 4:12": "For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:",
    "Ephesians 4:13": "Until we all meet into the unity of faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the age of the fulness of Christ;",
    "Ephesians 4:14": "That henceforth we be no more children tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the wickedness of men, by cunning craftiness, by which they lie in wait to deceive",
    "Ephesians 4:15": "But doing the truth in charity, we may in all things grow up in him who is the head, even Christ:",
    "Ephesians 4:16": "From whom the whole body, being compacted and fitly joined together, by what every joint supplieth, according to the operation in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body, unto the edifying of itself in charity.",
    "Ephesians 4:17": "This then I say and testify in the Lord: That henceforward you walk not as also the Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind,",
    "Ephesians 4:18": "Having their understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their hearts.",
    "Ephesians 4:19": "Who despairing, have given themselves up to lasciviousness, unto the working of all uncleanness, unto the working of all uncleanness, unto covetousness.",
    "Ephesians 4:20": "But you have not so learned Christ;",
    "Ephesians 4:21": "If so be that you have heard him, and have been taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus:",
    "Ephesians 4:22": "To put off, according to former conversation, the old man, who is corrupted according to the desire of error.",
    "Ephesians 4:23": "And be renewed in the spirit of your mind:",
    "Ephesians 4:24": "And put on the new man, who according to God is created in justice and holiness of truth.",
    "Ephesians 4:25": "Wherefore putting away lying, speak ;ye the truth every man with his neighbour; for we are members one of another.",
    "Ephesians 4:26": "Be angry, and sin not. Let not the sun go down upon your anger.",
    "Ephesians 4:27": "Give not place to the devil.",
    "Ephesians 4:28": "He that stole, let him now steal no more; but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have something to give to him that suffereth need.",
    "Ephesians 4:29": "Let no evil speech proceed from your mouth; but that which is good, to the edification of faith, that it may administer grace to the hearers.",
    "Ephesians 4:30": "And grieve not the holy Spirit of God: whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption.",
    "Ephesians 4:31": "Let all bitterness, and anger, and indignation, and clamour, and blasphemy, be put away from you, with all malice.",
    "Ephesians 4:32": "And be ye kind one to another; merciful, forgiving one another, even as God hath forgiven you in Christ.",
    "Ephesians 5:1": "Be ye therefore followers of God, as most dear children;",
    "Ephesians 5:2": "And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath delivered himself for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to God for an odour of sweetness.",
    "Ephesians 5:3": "But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not so much as be named among you, as becometh saints:",
    "Ephesians 5:4": "Or obscenity, or foolish talking, or scurrility, which is to no purpose; but rather giving of thanks.",
    "Ephesians 5:5": "For know you this and understand, that no fornicator, or unclean, or covetous person (which is a serving of idols), hath inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.",
    "Ephesians 5:6": "Let no man deceive you with vain words. For because of these things cometh the anger of God upon the children of unbelief.",
    "Ephesians 5:7": "Be ye not therefore partakers with them.",
    "Ephesians 5:8": "For you were heretofore darkness, but now light in the Lord. Walk then as children of the light.",
    "Ephesians 5:9": "For the fruit of the light is in all goodness, and justice, and truth;",
    "Ephesians 5:10": "Proving what is well pleasing to God:",
    "Ephesians 5:11": "And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.",
    "Ephesians 5:12": "For the things that are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.",
    "Ephesians 5:13": "But all things that are reproved, are made manifest by the light; for all that is made manifest is light.",
    "Ephesians 5:14": "Wherefore he saith: Rise thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead: and Christ shall enlighten thee.",
    "Ephesians 5:15": "See therefore, brethren, how you walk circumspectly: not as unwise,",
    "Ephesians 5:16": "But as wise: redeeming the time, because the days are evil.",
    "Ephesians 5:17": "Wherefore become not unwise, but understanding what is the will of God.",
    "Ephesians 5:18": "And be not drunk with wine, wherein is luxury; but be ye filled with the holy Spirit,",
    "Ephesians 5:19": "Speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual canticles, singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord;",
    "Ephesians 5:20": "Giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God and the Father:",
    "Ephesians 5:21": "Being subject one to another, in the fear of Christ.",
    "Ephesians 5:22": "Let women be subject to their husbands, as to the Lord:",
    "Ephesians 5:23": "Because the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church. He is the saviour of his body.",
    "Ephesians 5:24": "Therefore as the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be to their husbands in all things.",
    "Ephesians 5:25": "Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church, and delivered himself up for it:",
    "Ephesians 5:26": "That he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life:",
    "Ephesians 5:27": "That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any; such thing; but that it should be holy, and without blemish.",
    "Ephesians 5:28": "So also ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife, loveth himself.",
    "Ephesians 5:29": "For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, as also Christ doth the church:",
    "Ephesians 5:30": "Because we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.",
    "Ephesians 5:31": "For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh.",
    "Ephesians 5:32": "This is a great sacrament; but I speak in Christ and in the church.",
    "Ephesians 5:33": "Nevertheless let every one of you in particular love his wife as himself: and let the wife fear her husband.",
    "Ephesians 6:1": "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is just.",
    "Ephesians 6:2": "Honour thy father and thy mother, which is the first commandment with a promise:",
    "Ephesians 6:3": "That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest be long lived upon earth.",
    "Ephesians 6:4": "And you, fathers, provoke not your children to anger; but bring them up in the discipline and correction of the Lord.",
    "Ephesians 6:5": "Servants, be obedient to them that are your lords according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the simplicity of your heart, as to Christ:",
    "Ephesians 6:6": "Not serving to the eye, as it were pleasing men, but, as the servants of Christ doing the will of God from the heart,",
    "Ephesians 6:7": "With a good will serving, as to the Lord, and not to men.",
    "Ephesians 6:8": "Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man shall do, the same shall he receive from the Lord, whether he be bond, or free.",
    "Ephesians 6:9": "And you, masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatenings, knowing that the Lord both of them and you is in heaven; and there is no respect of persons with him.",

    "Ephesians 6:11": "Put you on the armour of God, that you may be able to stand against the deceits of the devil.",
    "Ephesians 6:12": "For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood; but against principalities and power, against the rulers of the world of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in the high places.",

    "Ephesians 6:18": "By all prayer and supplication praying at all times in the spirit; and in the same watching with all instance and supplication for all the saints:",
    "Ephesians 6:19": "And for me, that speech may be given me, that I may open my mouth with confidence, to make known the mystery of the gospel.",
    "Ephesians 6:20": "For which I am an ambassador in a chain, so that therein I may be bold to speak according as I ought.",
    "Ephesians 6:21": "But that you also may know the things that concern me, and what I am doing, Tychicus, my dearest brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make known to you all things:",

    "Philippians 1:5": "For your communication in the gospel of Christ from the first day until now.",
    "Philippians 1:6": "Being confident of this very thing, that he, who hath begun a good work in you, will perfect it unto the day of Christ Jesus.",
    "Philippians 1:7": "As it is meet for me to think this for you all, for that I have you in my heart; and that in my bands, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my joy.",
    "Philippians 1:8": "For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.",
    "Philippians 1:9": "And this I pray, that your charity may more and more abound in knowledge, and in all understanding:",

    "Philippians 1:11": "Filled with the fruit of justice, through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.",
    "Philippians 1:12": "Now, brethren, I desire you should know, that the things which have happened to me, have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel:",
    "Philippians 1:13": "So that my bands are made manifest in Christ, in all the court, and in all other places;",
    "Philippians 1:14": "And many of the brethren in the Lord, growing confident by my bands, are much more bold to speak the word of God without fear.",
    "Philippians 1:15": "Some indeed, even out of envy and contention; but some also for good will preach Christ.",
    "Philippians 1:16": "Some out of charity, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.",
    "Philippians 1:17": "And some out of contention preach Christ not sincerely: supposing that they raise affliction to my bands.",
    "Philippians 1:18": "But what then? So that by all means, whether by occasion, or by truth, Christ be preached: in this also I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.",
    "Philippians 1:19": "For I know that this shall fall out to me unto salvation, through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,",
    "Philippians 1:20": "According to my expectation and hope; that in nothing I shall be confounded, but with all confidence, as always, so now also shall Christ be magnified in my body, wither it be by life, or by death.",
    "Philippians 1:21": "For to me, to live is Christ; and to die is gain.",
    "Philippians 1:22": "And if to live in the flesh, that is to me the fruit of labour, and what I shall choose I know not.",
    "Philippians 1:23": "But I am straitened between two: having a desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, a thing by far the better.",
    "Philippians 1:24": "But to abide still in the flesh, is needful for you.",
    "Philippians 1:25": "And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, and continue with you all, for your furtherance and joy of faith:",
    "Philippians 1:26": "That your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus for me, by my coming to you again.",
    "Philippians 1:27": "Only let your conversation be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you, or, being absent, may hear of you, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind labouring together for the faith of the gospel.",
    "Philippians 1:28": "And in nothing be ye terrified by the adversaries: which to them is a cause of perdition, but to you of salvation, and this from God:",
    "Philippians 1:29": "For unto you it is given for Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him.",
    "Philippians 1:30": "Having the same conflict as that which you have seen in me, and now have heard of me.",
    "Philippians 2:1": "If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of charity, if any society of the spirit, if any bowels of commiseration:",

    "Philippians 2:4": "Each one not considering the things that are his own, but those that are other menâ€™s.",
    "Philippians 2:5": "For let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:",
    "Philippians 2:6": "Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:",
    "Philippians 2:7": "But emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and in habit found as a man.",
    "Philippians 2:8": "He humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, even to the death of the cross.",
    "Philippians 2:9": "For which cause God also hath exalted him, and hath given him a name which is above all names:",
    "Philippians 2:10": "That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth:",
    "Philippians 2:11": "And that every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father.",
    "Philippians 2:12": "Wherefore, my dearly beloved, (as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but much more now in my absence,) with fear and trembling work out your salvation.",
    "Philippians 2:13": "For it is God who worketh in you, both to will and to accomplish, according to his good will.",
    "Philippians 2:14": "And do ye all things without murmurings and hesitations;",
    "Philippians 2:15": "That you may be blameless, and sincere children of God, without reproof, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation; among whom you shine as lights in the world.",
    "Philippians 2:16": "Holding forth the word of life to my glory in the day of Christ, because I have not run in vain, nor laboured in vain.",
    "Philippians 2:17": "Yea, and if I be made a victim upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and congratulate with you all.",
    "Philippians 2:18": "And for the selfsame thing do you also rejoice, and congratulate with me.",
    "Philippians 2:19": "And I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy unto you shortly, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know the things concerning you.",
    "Philippians 2:20": "For I have no man so of the same mind, who with sincere affection is solicitous for you.",
    "Philippians 2:21": "For all seek the things that are their own; not the things that are Jesus Christâ€™s.",
    "Philippians 2:22": "Now know ye the proof of him, that as a son with the father, so hath he served with me in the gospel.",
    "Philippians 2:23": "Him therefore I hope to send unto you immediately, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.",
    "Philippians 2:24": "And I trust in the Lord, that I myself also shall come to you shortly.",
    "Philippians 2:25": "But I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow labourer, and fellow soldier, but your apostle, and he that hath ministered to my wants.",
    "Philippians 2:26": "For indeed he longed after you all: and was sad, for that you had heard that he was sick.",
    "Philippians 2:27": "For indeed he was sick, nigh unto death; but God had mercy on him; and not only on him, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.",
    "Philippians 2:28": "Therefore I sent him the more speedily: that seeing him again, you may rejoice, and I may be without sorrow.",
    "Philippians 2:29": "Receive him therefore with all joy in the Lord; and treat with honour such as he is.",
    "Philippians 2:30": "Because for the work of Christ he came to the point of death: delivering his life, that he might fulfil that which on your part was wanting towards my service.",
    "Philippians 3:1": "As to the rest, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not wearisome, but to you it is necessary.",
    "Philippians 3:2": "Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.",
    "Philippians 3:3": "For we are the circumcision, who in spirit serve God; and glory in Christ Jesus, not having confidence in the flesh.",
    "Philippians 3:4": "Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other thinketh he may have confidence in the flesh, I more,",
    "Philippians 3:5": "Being circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; according to the law, a Pharisee:",
    "Philippians 3:6": "According to zeal, persecuting the church of God; according to the justice that is in the law, conversing without blame.",
    "Philippians 3:7": "But the things that were gain to me, the same I have counted loss for Christ.",
    "Philippians 3:8": "Furthermore I count all things to be but loss for the excellent knowledge of Jesus Christ my Lord; for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but as dung, that I may gain Christ:",
    "Philippians 3:9": "And may be found in him, not having my justice, which is of the law, but that which is of the faith of Christ Jesus, which is of God, justice in faith:",
    "Philippians 3:10": "That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death,",
    "Philippians 3:11": "If by any means I may attain to the resurrection which is from the dead.",
    "Philippians 3:12": "Not as though I has already attained, or were already perfect; but I follow after, if I may by any means apprehend, wherein I am also apprehended by Christ Jesus.",
    "Philippians 3:13": "Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended. But one thing I do: forgetting the things that are behind, and stretching forth myself to those that are before,",
    "Philippians 3:14": "I press towards the mark, to the prize of the supernal vocation of God in Christ Jesus.",
    "Philippians 3:15": "Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded; and if in any thing you be otherwise minded, this also God will reveal to you.",
    "Philippians 3:16": "Nevertheless whereunto we are come, that we be of the same mind, let us also continue in the same rule.",
    "Philippians 3:17": "Be ye followers of me, brethren, and observe them who walk so as you have our model.",
    "Philippians 3:18": "For many walk, of whom I have told you often (and now tell you weeping), that they are enemies of the cross of Christ;",
    "Philippians 3:19": "Whose end is destruction; whose God is their belly; and whose glory is in their shame; who mind earthly things.",
    "Philippians 3:20": "But our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ,",
    "Philippians 3:21": "Who will reform the body of our lowness, made like to the body of his glory, according to the operation whereby also he is able to subdue all things unto himself.",
    "Philippians 4:1": "Therefore, my dearly beloved brethren, and most desired, my joy and my crown; so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.",
    "Philippians 4:2": "I beg of Evodia, and I beseech Syntyche, to be of one mind in the Lord.",
    "Philippians 4:3": "And I entreat thee also, my sincere companion, help those women who have laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement and the rest of my fellow labourers, whose names are in the book of life.",
    "Philippians 4:4": "Rejoice in the Lord always; again, I say, rejoice.",
    "Philippians 4:5": "Let your modesty be known to all men. The Lord is nigh.",
    "Philippians 4:6": "Be nothing solicitous; but in every thing, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God.",
    "Philippians 4:7": "And the peace of God, which surpasseth all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.",
    "Philippians 4:8": "For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever modest, whatsoever just, whatsoever holy, whatsoever lovely, whatsoever of good fame, if there be any virtue, if any praise of discipline, think on these things.",
    "Philippians 4:9": "The things which you have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, these do ye, and the God of peace shall be with you.",
    "Philippians 4:10": "Now I rejoice in the Lord exceedingly, that now at length your thought for me hath flourished again, as you did also think; but you were busied.",
    "Philippians 4:11": "I speak not as it were for want. For I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, to be content therewith.",
    "Philippians 4:12": "I know both how to be brought low, and I know how to abound: (everywhere, and in all things I am instructed) both to be full, and to be hungry; both to abound, and to suffer need.",
    "Philippians 4:13": "I can do all these things in him who strengtheneth me.",
    "Philippians 4:14": "Nevertheless you have done well in communicating to my tribulation.",
    "Philippians 4:15": "And you also know, O Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only:",
    "Philippians 4:16": "For unto Thessalonica also you sent once and again for my use.",
    "Philippians 4:17": "Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that may abound to your account.",
    "Philippians 4:18": "But I have all, and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things you sent, an odour of sweetness, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.",
    "Philippians 4:19": "And may my God supply all your want, according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.",
    "Philippians 4:20": "Now to God and our Father be glory world without end. Amen.",
    "Philippians 4:21": "Salute ye every saint in Christ Jesus.",
    "Philippians 4:22": "The brethren who are with me, salute you. All the saints salute you; especially they that are of Caesarâ€™s household.",

    "Colossians 3:2": "Mind the things that are above, not the things that are upon the earth.",
    "Colossians 3:3": "For you are dead; and your life is hid with Christ in God.",
    "Colossians 3:4": "When Christ shall appear, who is your life, then you also shall appear with him in glory.",
    "Colossians 3:5": "Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, lust, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is the service of idols.",
    "Colossians 3:6": "For which things the wrath of God cometh upon the children of unbelief,",
    "Colossians 3:7": "In which you also walked some time, when you lived in them.",
    "Colossians 3:8": "But now put you also all away: anger, indignation, malice, blasphemy, filthy speech out of your mouth.",
    "Colossians 3:9": "Lie not one to another: stripping yourselves of the old man with his deeds,",
    "Colossians 3:10": "And putting on the new, him who is renewed unto knowledge, according to the image of him that created him.",
    "Colossians 3:11": "Where there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free. But Christ is all, and in all.",
    "Colossians 3:12": "Put ye on therefore, as the elect of God, holy, and beloved, the bowels of mercy, benignity, humility, modesty, patience:",
    "Colossians 3:13": "Bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if any have a complaint against another: even as the Lord hath forgiven you, so do you also.",
    "Colossians 3:14": "But above all these things have charity, which is the bond of perfection:",
    "Colossians 3:15": "And let the peace of Christ rejoice in your hearts, wherein also you are called in one body: and be ye thankful.",
    "Colossians 3:16": "Let the word of Christ dwell in you abundantly, in all wisdom: teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual canticles, singing in grace in your hearts to God.",

    "1 Thessalonians 1:7": "So that you were made a pattern to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.",
    "1 Thessalonians 1:8": "For from you was spread abroad the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia, and in Achaia, but also in every place, your faith which is towards God, is gone forth, so that we need not to speak any thing.",

    "1 Thessalonians 2:6": "Nor sought we glory of men, neither of you, nor of others.",
    "1 Thessalonians 2:7": "Whereas we might have been burdensome to you, as the apostles of Christ: but we became little ones in the midst of you, as if a nurse should cherish her children:",
    "1 Thessalonians 2:8": "So desirous of you, we would gladly impart unto you not only the gospel of God, but also our own souls: because you were become most dear unto us.",
    "1 Thessalonians 2:9": "For you remember, brethren, our labour and toil: working night and day, lest we should be chargeable to any of you, we preached among you the gospel of God.",

    "1 Thessalonians 2:16": "Prohibiting us to speak to the Gentiles, that they may be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath of God is come upon them to the end.",
    "1 Thessalonians 2:17": "But we, brethren, being taken away from you for a short time, in sight, not in heart, have hastened the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.",

    "1 Thessalonians 2:19": "For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of glory? Are not you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?",
    "1 Thessalonians 2:20": "For you are our glory and joy.",
    "1 Thessalonians 3:1": "For which cause, forbearing no longer, we thought it good to remain at Athens alone:",
    "1 Thessalonians 3:2": "And we sent Timothy, our brother, and the minister of God in the gospel of Christ, to confirm you and exhort you concerning your faith:",
    "1 Thessalonians 3:3": "That no man should be moved in these tribulations: for yourselves know, that we are appointed thereunto.",
    "1 Thessalonians 3:4": "For even when we were with you, we foretold you that we should suffer tribulations, as also it is come to pass, and you know.",
    "1 Thessalonians 3:5": "For this cause also, I, forbearing no longer, sent to know your faith: lest perhaps he that tempteth should have tempted you, and our labour should be made vain.",
    "1 Thessalonians 3:6": "But now when Timothy came to us from you, and related to us your faith and charity, and that you have a good remembrance of us always, desiring to see us as we also to see you;",
    "1 Thessalonians 3:7": "Therefore we were comforted, brethren, in you, in all our necessity and tribulation, by your faith,",
    "1 Thessalonians 3:8": "Because now we live, if you stand in the Lord.",
    "1 Thessalonians 3:9": "For what thanks can we return to God for you, in all the joy wherewith we rejoice for you before our God,",
    "1 Thessalonians 3:10": "Night and day more abundantly praying that we may see your face, and may accomplish those things that are wanting to your faith?",
    "1 Thessalonians 3:11": "Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.",

    "1 Thessalonians 4:2": "For you know what precepts I have given to you by the Lord Jesus.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:3": "For this is the will of God, your sanctification; that you should abstain from fornication;",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:4": "That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour:",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:5": "Not in the passion of lust, like the Gentiles that know not God:",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:6": "And that no man overreach, nor circumvent his brother in business: because the Lord is the avenger of all these things, as we have told you before, and have testified.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:7": "For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto sanctification.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:8": "Therefore, he that despiseth these things, despiseth not man, but God, who also hath given his holy Spirit in us.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:9": "But as touching the charity of brotherhood, we have no need to write to you: for yourselves have learned of God to love one another.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:10": "For indeed you do it towards all the brethren in all Macedonia. But we entreat you, brethren, that you abound more:",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:11": "And that you use your endeavour to be quiet, and that you do your own business, and work with your own hands, as we commanded you:",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:12": "and that you walk honestly towards them that are without; and that you want nothing of any manâ€™s.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:13": "And we will not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them that are asleep, that you be not sorrowful, even as others who have no hope.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:14": "For if we believe that Jesus died, and rose again; even so them who have slept through Jesus, will God bring with him.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:15": "For this we say unto you in the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who remain unto the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them who have slept.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:16": "For the Lord himself shall come down from heaven with commandment, and with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God: and the dead who are in Christ, shall rise first.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:17": "Then we who are alive, who are left, shall be taken up together with them in the clouds to meet Christ, into the air, and so shall we be always with the Lord.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:18": "Wherefore, comfort ye one another with these words.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:1": "But of the times and moments, brethren, you need not, that we should write to you;",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:2": "For yourselves know perfectly, that the day of the Lord shall so come, as a thief in the night.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:3": "For when they shall say, peace and security; then shall sudden destruction come upon them, as the pains upon her that is with child, and they shall not escape.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:4": "But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:5": "For all you are the children of light, and children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:6": "Therefore, let us not sleep, as others do; but let us watch, and be sober.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:7": "For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that are drunk, are drunk in the night.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:8": "But let us, who are of the day, be sober, having on the breastplate of faith and charity, and for a helmet the hope of salvation.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:9": "For God hath not appointed us unto wrath, but unto the purchasing of salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:10": "Who died for us; that, whether we watch or sleep, we may live together with him.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:11": "For which cause comfort one another; and edify one another, as you also do.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:12": "And we beseech you, brethren, to know them who labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you:",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:13": "That you esteem them more abundantly in charity, for their workâ€™s sake. Have peace with them.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:14": "And we beseech you, brethren, rebuke the unquiet, comfort the feeble minded, support the weak, be patient towards all men.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:15": "See that none render evil for evil to any man; but ever follow that which is good towards each other, and towards all men.",

    "2 Thessalonians 1:2": "Grace unto you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:3": "We are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren, as it is fitting, because your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you towards each other, aboundeth:",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:4": "So that we ourselves also glory in you in the churches of God, for your patience and faith, and in all your persecutions and tribulations, which you endure,",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:5": "For an example of the just judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which also you suffer.",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:6": "Seeing it is a just thing with God to repay tribulation to them that trouble you:",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:7": "And to you who are troubled, rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven, with the angels of his power:",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:8": "In a flame of fire, giving vengeance to them who know not God, and who obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:9": "Who shall suffer eternal punishment in destruction, from the face of the Lord, and from the glory of his power:",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:10": "When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be made wonderful in all them who have believed; because our testimony was believed upon you in that day.",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:11": "Wherefore also we pray always for you; that our God would make you worthy of his vocation, and fulfill all the good pleasure of his goodness and the work of faith in power;",

    "2 Thessalonians 2:2": "That you be not easily moved from your sense, nor be terrified, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by epistle, as sent from us, as if the day of the Lord were at hand.",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:3": "Let no man deceive you by any means, for unless there come a revolt first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition,",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:4": "Who opposeth, and is lifted up above all that is called God, or that is worshipped, so that he sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself as if he were God.",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:5": "Remember you not, that when I was yet with you, I told you these things?",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:6": "And now you know what withholdeth, that he may be revealed in his time.",

    "2 Thessalonians 3:7": "For yourselves know how you ought to imitate us: for we were not disorderly among you;",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:8": "Neither did we eat any manâ€™s bread for nothing, but in labour and in toil we worked night and day, lest we should be chargeable to any of you.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:9": "Not as if we had not power: but that we might give ourselves a pattern unto you, to imitate us.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:10": "For also when we were with you, this we declared to you: that, if any man will not work, neither let him eat.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:11": "For we have heard there are some among you who walk disorderly, working not at all, but curiously meddling.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:12": "Now we charge them that are such, and beseech them by the Lord Jesus Christ, that, working with silence, they would eat their own bread.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:13": "But you, brethren, be not weary in well doing.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:14": "And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed:",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:15": "Yet do not esteem him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:16": "Now the Lord of peace himself give you everlasting peace in every place. The Lord be with you all.",

    "1 Timothy 1:2": "To Timothy, his beloved son in faith. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus our Lord.",
    "1 Timothy 1:3": "As I desired thee to remain at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some not to teach otherwise,",
    "1 Timothy 1:4": "Not to give heed to fables and endless genealogies: which furnish questions rather than the edification of God, which is in faith.",
    "1 Timothy 1:5": "Now the end of the commandment is charity, from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and an unfeigned faith.",
    "1 Timothy 1:6": "From which things some going astray, are turned aside unto vain babbling:",
    "1 Timothy 1:7": "Desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither the things they say, nor whereof they affirm.",

    "1 Timothy 2:9": "In like manner women also in decent apparel: adorning themselves with modesty and sobriety, not with plaited hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly attire,",
    "1 Timothy 2:10": "But as it becometh women professing godliness, with good works.",
    "1 Timothy 2:11": "Let the woman learn in silence, with all subjection.",
    "1 Timothy 2:12": "But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to use authority over the man: but to be in silence.",
    "1 Timothy 2:13": "For Adam was first formed; then Eve.",
    "1 Timothy 2:14": "And Adam was not seduced; but the woman being seduced, was in the transgression.",
    "1 Timothy 2:15": "Yet she shall be saved through childbearing; if she continue in faith, and love, and sanctification, with sobriety.",

    "Philemon 1:21": "Trusting in thy obedience, I have written to thee: knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.",
    "Philemon 1:22": "But withal prepare me also a lodging. For I hope that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.",
    "Philemon 1:23": "There salute thee Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus;",
    "Philemon 1:24": "Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke my fellow labourers.",
    "Philemon 1:25": "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.",
    "Hebrews 1:1": "God, who, at sundry times and in divers manners, spoke in times past to the fathers by the prophets, last of all,",
    "Hebrews 1:2": "In these days hath spoken to us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the world.",
    "Hebrews 1:3": "Who being the brightness of his glory, and the figure of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, making purgation of sins, sitteth on the right hand of the majesty on high.",
    "Hebrews 1:4": "Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they.",
    "Hebrews 1:5": "For to which of the angels hath he said at any time, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?",
    "Hebrews 1:6": "And again, when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world, he saith: And let all the angels of God adore him.",
    "Hebrews 1:7": "And to the angels indeed he saith: He that maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.",
    "Hebrews 1:8": "But to the Son: Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of justice is the sceptre of thy kingdom.",
    "Hebrews 1:9": "Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.",
    "Hebrews 1:10": "And: Thou in the beginning, O Lord, didst found the earth: and the works of thy hands are the heavens.",
    "Hebrews 1:11": "They shall perish, but thou shalt continue: and they shall all grow old as a garment.",
    "Hebrews 1:12": "And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art the selfsame, and thy years shall not fail.",
    "Hebrews 1:13": "But to which of the angels said he at any time: Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool?",
    "Hebrews 1:14": "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent to minister for them, who shall receive the inheritance of salvation?",
    "Hebrews 2:1": "Therefore ought we more diligently to observe the things which we have heard, lest perhaps we should let them slip.",
    "Hebrews 2:2": "For if the word, spoken by angels, became steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward:",
    "Hebrews 2:3": "How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation? which having begun to be declared by the Lord, was confirmed unto us by them that heard him.",
    "Hebrews 2:4": "God also bearing them witness by signs, and wonders, and divers miracles, and distributions of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will.",
    "Hebrews 2:5": "For God hath not subjected unto angels the world to come, whereof we speak.",
    "Hebrews 2:6": "But one in a certain place hath testified, saying: What is man, that thou art mindful of him: or the son of man, that thou visitest him?",
    "Hebrews 2:7": "Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels: thou hast crowned him with glory and honour, and hast set him over the works of thy hands:",
    "Hebrews 2:8": "Thou hast subjected all things under his feet. For in that he hath subjected all things to him, he left nothing not subject to him. But now we see not as yet all things subject to him.",
    "Hebrews 2:9": "But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour: that, through the grace of God, he might taste death for all.",
    "Hebrews 2:10": "For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, who had brought many children into glory, to perfect the author of their salvation, by his passion.",
    "Hebrews 2:11": "For both he that sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified, are all of one. For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying:",
    "Hebrews 2:12": "I will declare thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the church will I praise thee.",
    "Hebrews 2:13": "And again: I will put my trust in him. And again: Behold I and my children, whom God hath given me.",
    "Hebrews 2:14": "Therefore because the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner hath been partaker of the same: that, through death, he might destroy him who had the empire of death, that is to say, the devil:",
    "Hebrews 2:15": "And might deliver them, who through the fear of death were all their lifetime subject to servitude.",
    "Hebrews 2:16": "For no where doth he take hold of the angels: but of the seed of Abraham he taketh hold.",
    "Hebrews 2:17": "Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren, that he might become a merciful and faithful priest before God, that he might be a propitiation for the sins of the people.",
    "Hebrews 2:18": "For in that, wherein he himself hath suffered and been tempted, he is able to succour them also that are tempted.",
    "Hebrews 3:1": "Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly vocation, consider the apostle and high priest of our confession, Jesus:",
    "Hebrews 3:2": "Who is faithful to him that made him, as was also Moses in all his house.",
    "Hebrews 3:3": "For this man was counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, by so much as he that hath built the house, hath greater honour than the house.",
    "Hebrews 3:4": "For every house is built by some man: but he that created all things, is God.",
    "Hebrews 3:5": "And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be said:",
    "Hebrews 3:6": "But Christ as the Son in his own house: which house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and glory of hope unto the end.",
    "Hebrews 3:7": "Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith: To day if you shall hear his voice,",
    "Hebrews 3:8": "Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation; in the day of temptation in the desert,",
    "Hebrews 3:9": "Where your fathers tempted me, proved and saw my works,",
    "Hebrews 3:10": "Forty years: for which cause I was offended with this generation, and I said: They always err in heart. And they have not known my ways,",
    "Hebrews 3:11": "As I have sworn in my wrath: If they shall enter into my rest.",
    "Hebrews 3:12": "Take heed, brethren, lest perhaps there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, to depart from the living God.",
    "Hebrews 3:13": "But exhort one another every day, whilst it is called to day, that none of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.",
    "Hebrews 3:14": "For we are made partakers of Christ: yet so, if we hold the beginning of his substance firm unto the end.",
    "Hebrews 3:15": "While it is said, To day if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in that provocation.",
    "Hebrews 3:16": "For some who heard did provoke: but not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.",
    "Hebrews 3:17": "And with whom was he offended forty years? Was it not with them that sinned, whose carcasses were overthrown in the desert?",
    "Hebrews 3:18": "And to whom did he swear, that they should not enter into his rest: but to them that were incredulous?",
    "Hebrews 3:19": "And we see that they could not enter in, because of unbelief.",
    "Hebrews 4:1": "Let us fear therefore lest the promise being left of entering into his rest, any of you should be thought to be wanting.",
    "Hebrews 4:2": "For unto us also it hath been declared, in like manner as unto them. But the word of hearing did not profit them, not being mixed with faith of those things they heard.",
    "Hebrews 4:3": "For we, who have believed, shall enter into rest; as he said: As I have sworn in my wrath; If they shall enter into my rest; and this indeed when the works from the foundation of the world were finished.",
    "Hebrews 4:4": "For in a certain place he spoke of the seventh day thus: And God rested the seventh day from all his works.",
    "Hebrews 4:5": "And in this place again: If they shall enter into my rest.",
    "Hebrews 4:6": "Seeing then it remaineth that some are to enter into it, and they, to whom it was first preached, did not enter because of unbelief:",
    "Hebrews 4:7": "Again he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time, as it is above said: To day if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts.",
    "Hebrews 4:8": "For if Jesus had given them rest, he would never have afterwards spoken of another day.",
    "Hebrews 4:9": "There remaineth therefore a day of rest for the people of God.",
    "Hebrews 4:10": "For he that is entered into his rest, the same also hath rested from his works, as God did from his.",
    "Hebrews 4:11": "Let us hasten therefore to enter into that rest; lest any man fall into the same example of unbelief.",
    "Hebrews 4:12": "For the word of God is living and effectual, and more piercing than any two edged sword; and reaching unto the division of the soul and the spirit, of the joints also and the marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.",
    "Hebrews 4:13": "Neither is there any creature invisible in his sight: but all things are naked and open to his eyes, to whom our speech is.",
    "Hebrews 4:14": "Having therefore a great high priest that hath passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God: let us hold fast our confession.",
    "Hebrews 4:15": "For we have not a high priest, who can not have compassion on our infirmities: but one tempted in all things like as we are, without sin.",
    "Hebrews 4:16": "Let us go therefore with confidence to the throne of grace: that we may obtain mercy, and find grace in seasonable aid.",
    "Hebrews 5:1": "For every high priest taken from among men, is ordained for men in the things that appertain to God, that he may offer up gifts and sacrifices for sins:",
    "Hebrews 5:2": "Who can have compassion on them that are ignorant and that err: because he himself also is compassed with infirmity.",
    "Hebrews 5:3": "And therefore he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.",
    "Hebrews 5:4": "Neither doth any man take the honour to himself, but he that is called by God, as Aaron was.",
    "Hebrews 5:5": "So Christ also did not glorify himself, that he might be made a high priest: but he that said unto him: Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.",
    "Hebrews 5:6": "As he saith also in another place: Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedech.",
    "Hebrews 5:7": "Who in the days of his flesh, with a strong cry and tears, offering up prayers and supplications to him that was able to save him from death, was heard for his reverence.",
    "Hebrews 5:8": "And whereas indeed he was the Son of God, he learned obedience by the things which he suffered:",
    "Hebrews 5:9": "And being consummated, he became, to all that obey him, the cause of eternal salvation.",
    "Hebrews 5:10": "Called by God a high priest according to the order of Melchisedech.",
    "Hebrews 5:11": "Of whom we have much to say, and hard to be intelligibly uttered: because you are become weak to hear.",
    "Hebrews 5:12": "For whereas for the time you ought to be masters, you have need to be taught again what are the first elements of the words of God: and you are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.",
    "Hebrews 5:13": "For every one that is a partaker of milk, is unskillful in the word of justice: for he is a little child.",
    "Hebrews 5:14": "But strong meat is for the perfect; for them who by custom have their senses exercised to the discerning of good and evil.",
    "Hebrews 6:1": "Wherefore leaving the word of the beginning of Christ, let us go on to things more perfect, not laying again the foundation of penance from dead works, and of faith towards God,",
    "Hebrews 6:2": "Of the doctrine of baptisms, and imposition of hands, and of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.",
    "Hebrews 6:3": "And this will we do, if God permit.",
    "Hebrews 6:4": "For it is impossible for those who were once illuminated, have tasted also the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,",
    "Hebrews 6:5": "Have moreover tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,",
    "Hebrews 6:6": "And are fallen away: to be renewed again to penance, crucifying again to themselves the Son of God, and making him a mockery.",
    "Hebrews 6:7": "For the earth that drinketh in the rain which cometh often upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is tilled, receiveth blessing from God.",
    "Hebrews 6:8": "But that which bringeth forth thorns and briers, is reprobate, and very near unto a curse, whose end is to be burnt.",
    "Hebrews 6:9": "But, my dearly beloved, we trust better things of you, and nearer to salvation; though we speak thus.",
    "Hebrews 6:10": "For God is not unjust, that he should forget your work, and the love which you have shewn in his name, you who have ministered, and do minister to the saints.",
    "Hebrews 6:11": "And we desire that every one of you shew forth the same carefulness to the accomplishing of hope unto the end:",
    "Hebrews 6:12": "That you become not slothful, but followers of them, who through faith and patience shall inherit the promises.",
    "Hebrews 6:13": "For God making promise to Abraham, because he had no one greater by whom he might swear, swore by himself,",
    "Hebrews 6:14": "Saying: Unless blessing I shall bless thee, and multiplying I shall multiply thee.",
    "Hebrews 6:15": "And so patiently enduring he obtained the promise.",
    "Hebrews 6:16": "For men swear by one greater than themselves: and an oath for confirmation is the end of all their controversy.",
    "Hebrews 6:17": "Wherein God, meaning more abundantly to shew to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed an oath:",
    "Hebrews 6:18": "That by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have the strongest comfort, who have fled for refuge to hold fast the hope set before us.",
    "Hebrews 6:19": "Which we have as an anchor of the soul, sure and firm, and which entereth in even within the veil;",
    "Hebrews 6:20": "Where the forerunner Jesus is entered for us, made a high priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedech.",
    "Hebrews 7:1": "For this Melchisedech was king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him:",
    "Hebrews 7:2": "To whom also Abraham divided the tithes of all: who first indeed by interpretation, is king of justice: and then also king of Salem, that is, king of peace:",
    "Hebrews 7:3": "Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened unto the Son of God, continueth a priest for ever.",
    "Hebrews 7:4": "Now consider how great this man is, to whom also Abraham the patriarch gave tithes out of the principal things.",
    "Hebrews 7:5": "And indeed they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is to say, of their brethren: though they themselves also came out of the loins of Abraham.",
    "Hebrews 7:6": "But he, whose pedigree is not numbered among them, received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.",
    "Hebrews 7:7": "And without all contradiction, that which is less, is blessed by the better.",
    "Hebrews 7:8": "And here indeed, men that die, receive thithes: but there he hath witness, that he liveth.",
    "Hebrews 7:9": "And (as it may be said) even Levi who received tithes, paid tithes in Abraham:",
    "Hebrews 7:10": "For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedech met him.",
    "Hebrews 7:11": "If then perfection was by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise according to the order of Melchisedech, and not be called according to the order of Aaron?",
    "Hebrews 7:12": "For the priesthood being translated, it is necessary that a translation also be made of the law.",
    "Hebrews 7:13": "For he, of whom these things are spoken, is of another tribe, of which no one attended on the altar.",
    "Hebrews 7:14": "For it is evident that our Lord sprung out of Juda: in which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.",
    "Hebrews 7:15": "And it is yet far more evident: if according to the similitude of Melchisedech there ariseth another priest,",
    "Hebrews 7:16": "Who is made not according to the law of a carnal commandment, but according to the power of an indissoluble life:",
    "Hebrews 7:17": "For he testifieth: Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedech.",
    "Hebrews 7:18": "There is indeed a setting aside of the former commandment, because of the weakness and unprofitableness thereof:",
    "Hebrews 7:19": "(For the law brought nothing to perfection,) but a bringing in of a better hope, by which we draw nigh to God.",
    "Hebrews 7:20": "And inasmuch as it is not without an oath, (for the others indeed were made priests without an oath;",
    "Hebrews 7:21": "But this with an oath, by him that said unto him: The Lord hath sworn, and he will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever.)",
    "Hebrews 7:22": "By so much is Jesus made a surety of a better testament.",
    "Hebrews 7:23": "And the others indeed were made many priests, because by reason of death they were not suffered to continue:",
    "Hebrews 7:24": "But this, for that he continueth for ever, hath an everlasting priesthood,",
    "Hebrews 7:25": "Whereby he is able also to save for ever them that come to God by him; always living to make intercession for us.",
    "Hebrews 7:26": "For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;",
    "Hebrews 7:27": "Who needeth not daily (as the other priests) to offer sacrifices first for his own sins, and then for the peopleâ€™s: for this he did once, in offering himself.",
    "Hebrews 7:28": "For the law maketh men priests, who have infirmity: but the word of the oath, which was since the law, the Son who is perfected for evermore.",
    "Hebrews 8:1": "Now of the things which we have spoken, this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of majesty in the heavens,",
    "Hebrews 8:2": "A minister of the holies, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord hath pitched, and not man.",
    "Hebrews 8:3": "For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that he also should have some thing to offer.",
    "Hebrews 8:4": "If then he were on earth, he would not be a priest: seeing that there would be others to offer gifts according to the law,",
    "Hebrews 8:5": "Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things. As it was answered to Moses, when he was to finish the tabernacle: See (saith he) that thou make all things according to the pattern which was shewn thee on the mount.",
    "Hebrews 8:6": "But now he hath obtained a better ministry, by how much also he is a mediator of a better testament, which is established on better promises.",
    "Hebrews 8:7": "For if that former had been faultless, there should not indeed a place have been sought for a second.",
    "Hebrews 8:8": "For finding fault with them, he saith: Behold, the days shall come, saith the Lord: and I will perfect unto the house of Israel, and unto the house of Juda, a new testament:",
    "Hebrews 8:9": "Not according to the testament which I made to their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt: because they continued not in my testament: and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.",
    "Hebrews 8:10": "For this is the testament which I will make to the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will give my laws into their mind, and in their heart will I write them: and I will be their God, and they shall be my people:",
    "Hebrews 8:11": "And they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me from the least to the greatest of them:",
    "Hebrews 8:12": "Because I will be merciful to their iniquities, and their sins I will remember no more.",
    "Hebrews 8:13": "Now in saying a new, he hath made the former old. And that which decayeth and groweth old, is near its end.",
    "Hebrews 9:1": "The former indeed had also justifications of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.",
    "Hebrews 9:2": "For there was a tabernacle made the first, wherein were the candlesticks, and the table, and the setting forth of loaves, which is called the holy.",
    "Hebrews 9:3": "And after the second veil, the tabernacle, which is called the holy of holies:",
    "Hebrews 9:4": "Having a golden censer, and the ark of the testament covered about on every part with gold, in which was a golden pot that had manna, and the rod of Aaron, that had blossomed, and the tables of the testament.",
    "Hebrews 9:5": "And over it were the cherubims of glory overshadowing the propitiatory: of which it is not needful to speak now particularly.",
    "Hebrews 9:6": "Now these things being thus ordered, into the first tabernacle the priests indeed always entered, accomplishing the offices of sacrifices.",
    "Hebrews 9:7": "But into the second, the high priest alone, once a year: not without blood, which he offereth for his own, and the peopleâ€™s ignorance:",
    "Hebrews 9:8": "The Holy Ghost signifying this, that the way into the holies was not yet made manifest, whilst the former tabernacle was yet standing.",
    "Hebrews 9:9": "Which is a parable of the time present: according to which gifts and sacrifices are offered, which can not, as to the conscience, make him perfect that serveth, only in meats and in drinks,",
    "Hebrews 9:10": "And divers washings, and justices of the flesh laid on them until the time of correction.",
    "Hebrews 9:11": "But Christ, being come an high priest of the good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hand, that is, not of this creation:",
    "Hebrews 9:12": "Neither by the blood of goats, or of calves, but by his own blood, entered once into the holies, having obtained eternal redemption.",
    "Hebrews 9:13": "For if the blood of goats and of oxen, and the ashes of an heifer being sprinkled, sanctify such as are defiled, to the cleansing of the flesh:",
    "Hebrews 9:14": "How much more shall the blood of Christ, who by the Holy Ghost offered himself unspotted unto God, cleanse our conscience from dead works, to serve the living God?",
    "Hebrews 9:15": "And therefore he is the mediator of the new testament: that by means of his death, for the redemption of those trangressions, which were under the former testament, they that are called may receive the promise of eternal inheritance.",
    "Hebrews 9:16": "For where there is a testament, the death of the testator must of necessity come in.",
    "Hebrews 9:17": "For a testament is of force, after men are dead: otherwise it is as yet of no strength, whilst the testator liveth.",
    "Hebrews 9:18": "Whereupon neither was the first indeed dedicated without blood.",
    "Hebrews 9:19": "For when every commandment of the law had been read by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,",
    "Hebrews 9:20": "Saying: This is the blood of the testament, which God hath enjoined unto you.",
    "Hebrews 9:21": "The tabernacle also and all the vessels of the ministry, in like manner, he sprinkled with blood.",
    "Hebrews 9:22": "And almost all things, according to the law, are cleansed with blood: and without shedding of blood there is no remission.",
    "Hebrews 9:23": "It is necessary therefore that the patterns of heavenly things should be cleansed with these: but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.",
    "Hebrews 9:24": "For Jesus is not entered into the holies made with hands, the patterns of the true: but into heaven itself, that he may appear now in the presence of God for us.",
    "Hebrews 9:25": "Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holies, every year with the blood of others:",
    "Hebrews 9:26": "For then he ought to have suffered often from the beginning of the world: but now once at the end of ages, he hath appeared for the destruction of sin, by the sacrifice of himself.",
    "Hebrews 9:27": "And as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this the judgment:",
    "Hebrews 9:28": "So also Christ was offered once to exhaust the sins of many; the second time he shall appear without sin to them that expect him unto salvation.",
    "Hebrews 10:1": "For the law having a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image of the things; by the selfsame sacrifices which they offer continually every year, can never make the comers thereunto perfect:",
    "Hebrews 10:2": "For then they would have ceased to be offered: because the worshippers once cleansed should have no conscience of sin any longer:",
    "Hebrews 10:3": "But in them there is made a commemoration of sins every year.",
    "Hebrews 10:4": "For it is impossible that with the blood of oxen and goats sin should be taken away.",
    "Hebrews 10:5": "Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith: Sacrifice and oblation thou wouldest not: but a body thou hast fitted to me:",
    "Hebrews 10:6": "Holocausts for sin did not please thee.",
    "Hebrews 10:7": "Then said I: Behold I come: in the head of the book it is written of me: that I should do thy will, O God.",
    "Hebrews 10:8": "In saying before, Sacrifices, and oblations, and holocausts for sin thou wouldest not, neither are they pleasing to thee, which are offered according to the law.",
    "Hebrews 10:9": "Then said I: Behold, I come to do thy will, O God: he taketh away the first, that he may establish that which followeth.",
    "Hebrews 10:10": "In the which will, we are sanctified by the oblation of the body of Jesus Christ once.",
    "Hebrews 10:11": "And every priest indeed standeth daily ministering, and often offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.",
    "Hebrews 10:12": "But this man offering one sacrifice for sins, for ever sitteth on the right hand of God,",
    "Hebrews 10:13": "From henceforth expecting, until his enemies be made his footstool.",
    "Hebrews 10:14": "For by one oblation he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.",
    "Hebrews 10:15": "And the Holy Ghost also doth testify this to us. For after that he said:",
    "Hebrews 10:16": "And this is the testament which I will make unto them after those days, saith the Lord. I will give my laws in their hearts, and on their minds will I write them:",
    "Hebrews 10:17": "And their sins and iniquities I will remember no more.",
    "Hebrews 10:18": "Now where there is a remission of these, there is no more an oblation for sin.",
    "Hebrews 10:19": "Having therefore, brethren, a confidence in the entering into the holies by the blood of Christ;",
    "Hebrews 10:20": "A new and living way which he hath dedicated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh,",
    "Hebrews 10:21": "And a high priest over the house of God:",
    "Hebrews 10:22": "Let us draw near with a true heart in fulness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with clean water.",
    "Hebrews 10:23": "Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering (for he is faithful that hath promised),",

    "James 1:13": "Let no man, when he is tempted, say that he is tempted by God. For God is not a tempter of evils, and he tempteth no man.",
    "James 1:14": "But every man is tempted by his own concupiscence, being drawn away and allured.",
    "James 1:15": "Then when concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin. But sin, when it is completed, begetteth death.",
    "James 1:16": "Do not err, therefore, my dearest brethren.",
    "James 1:17": "Every best gift, and every perfect gift, is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change, nor shadow of alteration.",

    "James 1:19": "You know, my dearest brethren. And let every man be swift to hear, but slow to speak, and slow to anger.",
    "James 1:20": "For the anger of man worketh not the justice of God.",
    "James 1:21": "Wherefore casting away all uncleanness, and abundance of naughtiness, with meekness receive the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.",
    "James 1:22": "But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.",
    "James 1:23": "For if a man be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he shall be compared to a man beholding his own countenance in a glass.",
    "James 1:24": "For he beheld himself, and went his way, and presently forgot what manner of man he was.",
    "James 1:25": "But he that hath looked into the perfect law of liberty, and hath continued therein, not becoming a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work; this man shall be blessed in his deed.",

    "James 1:27": "Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father, is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation: and to keep oneâ€™s self unspotted from this world.",
    "James 2:1": "My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with respect of persons.",
    "James 2:2": "For if there shall come into your assembly a man having a golden ring, in fine apparel, and there shall come in also a poor man in mean attire,",
    "James 2:3": "And you have respect to him that is clothed with the fine apparel, and shall say to him: Sit thou here well; but say to the poor man: Stand thou there, or sit under my footstool:",
    "James 2:4": "Do you not judge within yourselves, and are become judges of unjust thoughts?",
    "James 2:5": "Hearken, my dearest brethren: hath not God chosen the poor in this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love him?",
    "James 2:6": "But you have dishonoured the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you by might? and do not they draw you before the judgment seats?",
    "James 2:7": "Do not they blaspheme the good name that is invoked upon you?",
    "James 2:8": "If then you fulfil the royal law, according to the scriptures, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; you do well.",
    "James 2:9": "But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, being reproved by the law as transgressors.",
    "James 2:10": "And whosoever shall keep the whole law, but offend in one point, is become guilty of all.",
    "James 2:11": "For he that said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also, Thou shalt not kill. Now if thou do not commit adultery, but shalt kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.",
    "James 2:12": "So speak ye, and so do, as being to be judged by the law of liberty.",
    "James 2:13": "For judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy. And mercy exalteth itself above judgment.",
    "James 2:14": "What shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but hath not works? Shall faith be able to save him?",
    "James 2:15": "And if a brother or sister be naked, and want daily food:",
    "James 2:16": "And one of you say to them: Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; yet give them not those things that are necessary for the body, what shall it profit?",
    "James 2:17": "So faith also, if it have not works, is dead in itself.",
    "James 2:18": "But some man will say: Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without works; and I will shew thee, by works, my faith.",
    "James 2:19": "Thou believest that there is one God. Thou dost well: the devils also believe and tremble.",
    "James 2:20": "But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?",
    "James 2:21": "Was not Abraham our father justified by works, offering up Isaac his son upon the altar?",
    "James 2:22": "Seest thou, that faith did co-operate with his works; and by works faith was made perfect?",
    "James 2:23": "And the scripture was fulfilled, saying: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him to justice, and he was called the friend of God.",
    "James 2:24": "Do you see that by works a man is justified; and not by faith only?",
    "James 2:25": "And in like manner also Rahab the harlot, was not she justified by works, receiving the messengers, and sending them out another way?",
    "James 2:26": "For even as the body without the spirit is dead; so also faith without works is dead.",
    "James 3:1": "Be ye not many masters, my brethren, knowing that you receive the greater judgment.",
    "James 3:2": "For in many things we all offend. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man. He is able also with a bridle to lead about the whole body.",
    "James 3:3": "For if we put bits into the mouths of horses, that they may obey us, and we turn about their whole body.",
    "James 3:4": "Behold also ships, whereas they are great, and are driven by strong winds, yet are they turned about with a small helm, whithersoever the force of the governor willeth.",
    "James 3:5": "Even so the tongue is indeed a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold how small a fire kindleth a great wood.",
    "James 3:6": "And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. The tongue is placed among our members, which defileth the whole body, and inflameth the wheel of our nativity, being set on fire by hell.",
    "James 3:7": "For every nature of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of the rest, is tamed, and hath been tamed, by the nature of man:",
    "James 3:8": "But the tongue no man can tame, an unquiet evil, full of deadly poison.",
    "James 3:9": "By it we bless God and the Father: and by it we curse men, who are made after the likeness of God.",
    "James 3:10": "Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.",
    "James 3:11": "Doth a fountain send forth, out of the same hole, sweet and bitter water?",
    "James 3:12": "Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear grapes; or the vine, figs? So neither can the salt water yield sweet.",
    "James 3:13": "Who is a wise man, and endued with knowledge among you? Let him shew, by a good conversation, his work in the meekness of wisdom.",
    "James 3:14": "But if you have bitter zeal, and there be contentions in your hearts; glory not, and be not liars against the truth.",
    "James 3:15": "For this is not wisdom, descending from above: but earthly, sensual, devilish.",
    "James 3:16": "For where envying and contention is, there is inconstancy, and every evil work.",
    "James 3:17": "But the wisdom, that is from above, first indeed is chaste, then peaceable, modest, easy to be persuaded, consenting to the good, full of mercy and good fruits, without judging, without dissimulation.",
    "James 3:18": "And the fruit of justice is sown in peace, to them that make peace.",
    "James 4:1": "From whence are wars and contentions among you? Are they not hence, from your concupiscences, which war in your members?",
    "James 4:2": "You covet, and have not: you kill, and envy, and can not obtain. You contend and war, and you have not, because you ask not.",
    "James 4:3": "You ask, and receive not; because you ask amiss: that you may consume it on your concupiscences.",
    "James 4:4": "Adulterers, know you not that the friendship of this world is the enemy of God? Whosoever therefore will be a friend of this world, becometh an enemy of God.",
    "James 4:5": "Or do you think that the scripture saith in vain: To envy doth the spirit covet which dwelleth in you?",
    "James 4:6": "But he giveth greater grace. Wherefore he saith: God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.",
    "James 4:7": "Be subject therefore to God, but resist the devil, and he will fly from you.",
    "James 4:8": "Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners: and purify your hearts, ye double minded.",
    "James 4:9": "Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into sorrow.",
    "James 4:10": "Be humbled in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you.",
    "James 4:11": "Detract not one another, my brethren. He that detracteth his brother, or he that judgeth his brother, detracteth the law, and judgeth the law. But if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.",
    "James 4:12": "There is one lawgiver, and judge, that is able to destroy and to deliver.",
    "James 4:13": "But who art thou that judgest thy neighbour? Behold, now you that say: To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and there we will spend a year, and will traffic, and make our gain.",
    "James 4:14": "Whereas you know not what shall be on the morrow.",
    "James 4:15": "For what is your life? It is a vapour which appeareth for a little while, and afterwards shall vanish away. For that you should say: If the Lord will, and if we shall live, we will do this or that.",
    "James 4:16": "But now you rejoice in your arrogancies. All such rejoicing is wicked.",
    "James 4:17": "To him therefore who knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is sin.",
    "James 5:1": "Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl in your miseries, which shall come upon you.",
    "James 5:2": "Your riches are corrupted: and your garments are motheaten.",
