    "Malachi 1:4": "Whereas Edom saith, We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places; thus saith Jehovah of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and men shall call them The border of wickedness, and The people against whom Jehovah hath indignation for ever.",

    "Malachi 3:3": "and he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and silver; and they shall offer unto Jehovah offerings in righteousness.",
    "Malachi 3:4": "Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.",
    "Malachi 3:5": "And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against the false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the sojourner from his right, and fear not me, saith Jehovah of hosts.",

    "Malachi 3:9": "Ye are cursed with the curse; for ye rob me, even this whole nation.",
    "Malachi 3:10": "Bring ye the whole tithe into the store-house, that there may be food in my house, and prove me now herewith, saith Jehovah of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.",

    "Malachi 3:13": "Your words have been stout against me, saith Jehovah. Yet ye say, What have we spoken against thee?",
    "Malachi 3:14": "Ye have said, It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we have kept his charge, and that we have walked mournfully before Jehovah of hosts?",
    "Malachi 3:15": "and now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are built up; yea, they tempt God, and escape.",
    "Malachi 3:16": "Then they that feared Jehovah spake one with another; and Jehovah hearkened, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before him, for them that feared Jehovah, and that thought upon his name.",
    "Malachi 3:17": "And they shall be mine, saith Jehovah of hosts, even mine own possession, in the day that I make; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.",
    "Malachi 3:18": "Then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.",

    "Matthew 26:8": "But when the disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?",
    "Matthew 26:9": "For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.",
    "Matthew 26:10": "But Jesus perceiving it said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.",
    "Matthew 26:11": "For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.",

    "Matthew 26:32": "But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.",
    "Matthew 26:33": "But Peter answered and said unto him, If all shall be offended in thee, I will never be offended.",

    "Matthew 26:42": "Again a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, thy will be done.",
    "Matthew 26:43": "And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.",
    "Matthew 26:44": "And he left them again, and went away, and prayed a third time, saying again the same words.",

    "Matthew 27:41": "In like manner also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,",
    "Matthew 27:42": "He saved others; himself he cannot save. He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on him.",
    "Matthew 27:43": "He trusteth on God; let him deliver him now, if he desireth him: for he said, I am the Son of God.",

    "Mark 7:13": "making void the word of God by your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things ye do.",
    "Mark 7:14": "And he called to him the multitude again, and said unto them, Hear me all of you, and understand:",
    "Mark 7:15": "there is nothing from without the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.",
    "Mark 7:16": "",
    "Mark 7:17": "And when he was entered into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked of him the parable.",
    "Mark 7:18": "And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Perceive ye not, that whatsoever from without goeth into the man, it cannot defile him;",
    "Mark 7:19": "because it goeth not into his heart, but into his belly, and goeth out into the draught? This he said, making all meats clean.",
    "Mark 7:20": "And he said, That which proceedeth out of the man, that defileth the man.",
    "Mark 7:21": "For from within, out of the heart of men, evil thoughts proceed, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries,",
    "Mark 7:22": "covetings, wickednesses, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, railing, pride, foolishness:",
    "Mark 7:23": "all these evil things proceed from within, and defile the man.",

    "Mark 8:4": "And his disciples answered him, Whence shall one be able to fill these men with bread here in a desert place?",
    "Mark 8:5": "And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.",
    "Mark 8:6": "And he commandeth the multitude to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, he brake, and gave to his disciples, to set before them; and they set them before the multitude.",
    "Mark 8:7": "And they had a few small fishes: and having blessed them, he commanded to set these also before them.",
    "Mark 8:8": "And they ate, and were filled: and they took up, of broken pieces that remained over, seven baskets.",

    "Mark 8:11": "And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, trying him.",
    "Mark 8:12": "And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.",
    "Mark 8:13": "And he left them, and again entering into the boat departed to the other side.",
    "Mark 8:14": "And they forgot to take bread; and they had not in the boat with them more than one loaf.",
    "Mark 8:15": "And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.",
    "Mark 8:16": "And they reasoned one with another, saying, We have no bread.",
    "Mark 8:17": "And Jesus perceiving it saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? do ye not yet perceive, neither understand? have ye your heart hardened?",
    "Mark 8:18": "Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?",

    "Luke 8:3": "and Joanna the wife of Chuzas Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered unto them of their substance.",
    "Luke 8:4": "And when a great multitude came together, and they of every city resorted unto him, he spake by a parable:",
    "Luke 8:5": "The sower went forth to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden under foot, and the birds of the heaven devoured it.",
    "Luke 8:6": "And other fell on the rock; and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture.",
    "Luke 8:7": "And other fell amidst the thorns; and the thorns grew with it, and choked it.",
    "Luke 8:8": "And other fell into the good ground, and grew, and brought forth fruit a hundredfold. As he said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.",
    "Luke 8:9": "And his disciples asked him what this parable might be.",
    "Luke 8:10": "And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to the rest in parables; that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.",
    "Luke 8:11": "Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.",
    "Luke 8:12": "And those by the way side are they that have heard; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.",
    "Luke 8:13": "And those on the rock are they who, when they have heard, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.",
    "Luke 8:14": "And that which fell among the thorns, these are they that have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.",
    "Luke 8:15": "And that in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it fast, and bring forth fruit with patience.",
    "Luke 8:16": "And no man, when he hath lighted a lamp, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but putteth it on a stand, that they that enter in may see the light.",
    "Luke 8:17": "For nothing is hid, that shall not be made manifest; nor anything secret, that shall not be known and come to light.",
    "Luke 8:18": "Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he thinketh he hath.",
    "Luke 8:19": "And there came to him his mother and brethren, and they could not come at him for the crowd.",
    "Luke 8:20": "And it was told him, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.",
    "Luke 8:21": "But he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these that hear the word of God, and do it.",
    "Luke 8:22": "Now it came to pass on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples; and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake: and they launched forth.",
    "Luke 8:23": "But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filling with water, and were in jeopardy.",
    "Luke 8:24": "And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. And he awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.",
    "Luke 8:25": "And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And being afraid they marvelled, saying one to another, Who then is this, that he commandeth even the winds and the water, and they obey him?",
    "Luke 8:26": "And they arrived at the country of the Gerasenes, which is over against Galilee.",
    "Luke 8:27": "And when he was come forth upon the land, there met him a certain man out of the city, who had demons; and for a long time he had worn no clothes, and abode not in any house, but in the tombs.",
    "Luke 8:28": "And when he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I beseech thee, torment me not.",
    "Luke 8:29": "For he was commanding the unclean spirit to come out from the man. For oftentimes it had seized him: and he was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters; and breaking the bands asunder, he was driven of the demon into the deserts.",
    "Luke 8:30": "And Jesus asked him, What is thy name? And he said, Legion; for many demons were entered into him.",
    "Luke 8:31": "And they entreated him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss.",
    "Luke 8:32": "Now there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they entreated him that he would give them leave to enter into them. And he gave them leave.",
    "Luke 8:33": "And the demons came out from the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake, and were drowned.",
    "Luke 8:34": "And when they that fed them saw what had come to pass, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.",
    "Luke 8:35": "And they went out to see what had come to pass; and they came to Jesus, and found the man, from whom the demons were gone out, sitting, clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus: and they were afraid.",
    "Luke 8:36": "And they that saw it told them how he that was possessed with demons was made whole.",
    "Luke 8:37": "And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes round about asked him to depart from them; for they were holden with great fear: and he entered into a boat, and returned.",
    "Luke 8:38": "But the man from whom the demons were gone out prayed him that he might be with him: but he sent him away, saying,",
    "Luke 8:39": "Return to thy house, and declare how great things God hath done for thee. And he went his way, publishing throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done for him.",
    "Luke 8:40": "And as Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him; for they were all waiting for him.",
    "Luke 8:41": "And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus’ feet, and besought him to come into his house;",
    "Luke 8:42": "for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went the multitudes thronged him.",
    "Luke 8:43": "And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, who had spent all her living upon physicians, and could not be healed of any,",
    "Luke 8:44": "came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately the issue of her blood stanched.",
    "Luke 8:45": "And Jesus said, Who is it that touched me? And when all denied, Peter said, and they that were with him, Master, the multitudes press thee and crush thee.",
    "Luke 8:46": "But Jesus said, Some one did touch me; for I perceived that power had gone forth from me.",
    "Luke 8:47": "And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people for what cause she touched him, and how she was healed immediately.",
    "Luke 8:48": "And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.",
    "Luke 8:49": "While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house, saying, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher.",
    "Luke 8:50": "But Jesus hearing it, answered him, Fear not: only believe, and she shall be made whole.",
    "Luke 8:51": "And when he came to the house, he suffered not any man to enter in with him, save Peter, and John, and James, and the father of the maiden and her mother.",
    "Luke 8:52": "And all were weeping, and bewailing her: but he said, Weep not; for she is not dead, but sleepeth.",
    "Luke 8:53": "And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.",
    "Luke 8:54": "But he, taking her by the hand, called, saying, Maiden, arise.",
    "Luke 8:55": "And her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately: and he commanded that something be given her to eat.",
    "Luke 8:56": "And her parents were amazed: but he charged them to tell no man what had been done.",
    "Luke 9:1": "And he called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.",
    "Luke 9:2": "And he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.",
    "Luke 9:3": "And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staff, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats.",
    "Luke 9:4": "And into whatsoever house ye enter, there abide, and thence depart.",
    "Luke 9:5": "And as many as receive you not, when ye depart from that city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.",
    "Luke 9:6": "And they departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the gospel, and healing everywhere.",
    "Luke 9:7": "Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done: and he was much perplexed, because that it was said by some, that John was risen from the dead;",
    "Luke 9:8": "and by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.",
    "Luke 9:9": "And Herod said, John I beheaded: but who is this, about whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.",
    "Luke 9:10": "And the apostles, when they were returned, declared unto him what things they had done. And he took them, and withdrew apart to a city, called Bethsaida.",
    "Luke 9:11": "But the multitudes perceiving it followed him: and he welcomed them, and spake to them of the kingdom of God, and them that had need of healing he cured.",
    "Luke 9:12": "And the day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages and country round about, and lodge, and get provisions: for we are here in a desert place.",
    "Luke 9:13": "But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy food for all this people.",
    "Luke 9:14": "For they were about five thousand men. And he said unto his disciples, Make them sit down in companies, about fifty each.",
    "Luke 9:15": "And they did so, and made them all sit down.",
    "Luke 9:16": "And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake; and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.",
    "Luke 9:17": "And they ate, and were all filled: and there was taken up that which remained over to them of broken pieces, twelve baskets.",
    "Luke 9:18": "And it came to pass, as he was praying apart, the disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Who do the multitudes say that I am?",
    "Luke 9:19": "And they answering said, John the Baptist; but others say, Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again.",
    "Luke 9:20": "And he said unto them, But who say ye that I am? And Peter answering said, The Christ of God.",
    "Luke 9:21": "But he charged them, and commanded them to tell this to no man;",
    "Luke 9:22": "saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.",
    "Luke 9:23": "And he said unto all, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.",
    "Luke 9:24": "For whosoever would save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.",
    "Luke 9:25": "For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose or forfeit his own self?",
    "Luke 9:26": "For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in his own glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels.",
    "Luke 9:27": "But I tell you of a truth, There are some of them that stand here, who shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.",
    "Luke 9:28": "And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray.",
    "Luke 9:29": "And as he was praying, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment became white and dazzling.",
    "Luke 9:30": "And behold, there talked with him two men, who were Moses and Elijah;",
    "Luke 9:31": "who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.",
    "Luke 9:32": "Now Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.",
    "Luke 9:33": "And it came to pass, as they were parting from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: not knowing what he said.",
    "Luke 9:34": "And while he said these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.",
    "Luke 9:35": "And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my Son, my chosen: hear ye him.",
    "Luke 9:36": "And when the voice came, Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace, and told no man in those days any of the things which they had seen.",
    "Luke 9:37": "And it came to pass, on the next day, when they were come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.",
    "Luke 9:38": "And behold, a man from the multitude cried, saying, Teacher, I beseech thee to look upon my son; for he is mine only child:",
    "Luke 9:39": "and behold, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth, and it hardly departeth from him, bruising him sorely.",
    "Luke 9:40": "And I besought thy disciples to cast it out; and they could not.",
    "Luke 9:41": "And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? bring hither thy son.",
    "Luke 9:42": "And as he was yet a coming, the demon dashed him down, and tare him grievously. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.",
    "Luke 9:43": "And they were all astonished at the majesty of God.But while all were marvelling at all the things which he did, he said unto his disciples,",
    "Luke 9:44": "Let these words sink into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men.",
    "Luke 9:45": "But they understood not this saying, and it was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.",
    "Luke 9:46": "And there arose a reasoning among them, which of them was the greatest.",
    "Luke 9:47": "But when Jesus saw the reasoning of their heart, he took a little child, and set him by his side,",
    "Luke 9:48": "and said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same is great.",
    "Luke 9:49": "And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he followeth not with us.",
    "Luke 9:50": "But Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against you is for you.",
    "Luke 9:51": "And it came to pass, when the days were well-nigh come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,",
    "Luke 9:52": "and sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.",
    "Luke 9:53": "And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he were going to Jerusalem.",
    "Luke 9:54": "And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we bid fire to come down from heaven, and consume them?",
    "Luke 9:55": "But he turned, and rebuked them.",
    "Luke 9:56": "And they went to another village.",
    "Luke 9:57": "And as they went on the way, a certain man said unto him, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.",
    "Luke 9:58": "And Jesus said unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.",
    "Luke 9:59": "And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.",
    "Luke 9:60": "But he said unto him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead; but go thou and publish abroad the kingdom of God.",
    "Luke 9:61": "And another also said, I will follow thee, Lord; but first suffer me to bid farewell to them that are at my house.",
    "Luke 9:62": "But Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.",
    "Luke 10:1": "Now after these things the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself was about to come.",
    "Luke 10:2": "And he said unto them, The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth laborers into his harvest.",

    "Luke 10:4": "Carry no purse, no wallet, no shoes; and salute no man on the way.",
    "Luke 10:5": "And into whatsoever house ye shall enter, first say, Peace be to this house.",
    "Luke 10:6": "And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon him: but if not, it shall turn to you again.",
    "Luke 10:7": "And in that same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.",
    "Luke 10:8": "And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:",
    "Luke 10:9": "and heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.",
    "Luke 10:10": "But into whatsoever city ye shall enter, and they receive you not, go out into the streets thereof and say,",
    "Luke 10:11": "Even the dust from your city, that cleaveth to our feet, we wipe off against you: nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh.",
    "Luke 10:12": "I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.",
    "Luke 10:13": "Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.",
    "Luke 10:14": "But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment, than for you.",
    "Luke 10:15": "And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt be brought down unto Hades.",
    "Luke 10:16": "He that heareth you heareth me; and he that rejecteth you rejecteth me; and he that rejecteth me rejecteth him that sent me.",
    "Luke 10:17": "And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject unto us in thy name.",
    "Luke 10:18": "And he said unto them, I beheld Satan fallen as lightning from heaven.",
    "Luke 10:19": "Behold, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall in any wise hurt you.",
    "Luke 10:20": "Nevertheless in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.",
    "Luke 10:21": "In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding, and didst reveal them unto babes: yea, Father; for so it was well-pleasing in thy sight.",
    "Luke 10:22": "All things have been delivered unto me of my Father: and no one knoweth who the Son is, save the Father; and who the Father is, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal him.",
    "Luke 10:23": "And turning to the disciples, he said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:",
    "Luke 10:24": "for I say unto you, that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.",
    "Luke 10:25": "And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and made trial of him, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?",
    "Luke 10:26": "And he said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?",
    "Luke 10:27": "And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.",
    "Luke 10:28": "And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.",
    "Luke 10:29": "But he, desiring to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbor?",
    "Luke 10:30": "Jesus made answer and said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho; and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.",
    "Luke 10:31": "And by chance a certain priest was going down that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.",
    "Luke 10:32": "And in like manner a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side.",
    "Luke 10:33": "But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion,",
    "Luke 10:34": "and came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on them oil and wine; and he set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.",
    "Luke 10:35": "And on the morrow he took out two shillings, and gave them to the host, and said, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, I, when I come back again, will repay thee.",
    "Luke 10:36": "Which of these three, thinkest thou, proved neighbor unto him that fell among the robbers?",
    "Luke 10:37": "And he said, He that showed mercy on him. And Jesus said unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.",
    "Luke 10:38": "Now as they went on their way, he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.",
    "Luke 10:39": "And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at the Lord’s feet, and heard his word.",
    "Luke 10:40": "But Martha was cumbered about much serving; and she came up to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister did leave me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.",
    "Luke 10:41": "But the Lord answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and troubled about many things:",
    "Luke 10:42": "but one thing is needful: for Mary hath chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her.",
    "Luke 11:1": "And it came to pass, as he was praying in a certain place, that when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples.",
    "Luke 11:2": "And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Father, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.",
    "Luke 11:3": "Give us day by day our daily bread.",
    "Luke 11:4": "And forgive us our sins; for we ourselves also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And bring us not into temptation.",
    "Luke 11:5": "And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;",
    "Luke 11:6": "for a friend of mine is come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him;",
    "Luke 11:7": "and he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee?",
    "Luke 11:8": "I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will arise and give him as many as he needeth.",
    "Luke 11:9": "And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.",
    "Luke 11:10": "For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.",
    "Luke 11:11": "And of which of you that is a father shall his son ask a loaf, and he give him a stone? or a fish, and he for a fish give him a serpent?",
    "Luke 11:12": "Or if he shall ask an egg, will he give him a scorpion?",
    "Luke 11:13": "If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?",
    "Luke 11:14": "And he was casting out a demon that was dumb. And it came to pass, when the demon was gone out, the dumb man spake; and the multitudes marvelled.",
    "Luke 11:15": "But some of them said, By Beelzebub the prince of the demons casteth he out demons.",
    "Luke 11:16": "And others, trying him, sought of him a sign from heaven.",
    "Luke 11:17": "But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth.",
    "Luke 11:18": "And if Satan also is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out demons by Beelzebub.",
    "Luke 11:19": "And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.",

    "Luke 11:26": "Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more evil than himself; and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first.",
    "Luke 11:27": "And it came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the breasts which thou didst suck.",

    "John 3:1": "Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:",
    "John 3:2": "the same came unto him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that thou doest, except God be with him.",

    "John 3:15": "that whosoever believeth may in him have eternal life.",
    "John 3:16": "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life.",
    "John 3:17": "For God sent not the Son into the world to judge the world; but that the world should be saved through him.",
    "John 3:18": "He that believeth on him is not judged: he that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.",
    "John 3:19": "And this is the judgment, that the light is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.",
    "John 3:20": "For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his works should be reproved.",

    "John 3:23": "And John also was baptizing in Ænon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.",
    "John 3:24": "For John was not yet cast into prison.",

    "John 3:33": "He that hath received his witness hath set his seal to this, that God is true.",
    "John 3:34": "For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for he giveth not the Spirit by measure.",

    "John 4:2": "(although Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples),",
    "John 4:3": "he left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.",
    "John 4:4": "And he must needs pass through Samaria.",
    "John 4:5": "So he cometh to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph:",
    "John 4:6": "and Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.",
    "John 4:7": "There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.",
    "John 4:8": "For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food.",
    "John 4:9": "The Samaritan woman therefore saith unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)",
    "John 4:10": "Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.",
    "John 4:11": "The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou that living water?",
    "John 4:12": "Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle?",
    "John 4:13": "Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again:",
    "John 4:14": "but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life.",
    "John 4:15": "The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come all the way hither to draw.",
    "John 4:16": "Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.",
    "John 4:17": "The woman answered and said unto him, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no husband:",
    "John 4:18": "for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly.",
    "John 4:19": "The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.",
    "John 4:20": "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.",
    "John 4:21": "Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father.",
    "John 4:22": "Ye worship that which ye know not: we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.",
    "John 4:23": "But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers.",
    "John 4:24": "God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth.",
    "John 4:25": "The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh (he that is called Christ): when he is come, he will declare unto us all things.",
    "John 4:26": "Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.",
    "John 4:27": "And upon this came his disciples; and they marvelled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?",
    "John 4:28": "So the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and saith to the people,",
    "John 4:29": "Come, see a man, who told me all things that ever I did: can this be the Christ?",
    "John 4:30": "They went out of the city, and were coming to him.",
    "John 4:31": "In the mean while the disciples prayed him, saying, Rabbi, eat.",
    "John 4:32": "But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not.",
    "John 4:33": "The disciples therefore said one to another, Hath any man brought him aught to eat?",
    "John 4:34": "Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work.",
    "John 4:35": "Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh the harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white already unto harvest.",
    "John 4:36": "He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.",
    "John 4:37": "For herein is the saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.",
    "John 4:38": "I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored: others have labored, and ye are entered into their labor.",
    "John 4:39": "And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all things that ever I did.",
    "John 4:40": "So when the Samaritans came unto him, they besought him to abide with them: and he abode there two days.",
    "John 4:41": "And many more believed because of his word;",
    "John 4:42": "and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.",
    "John 4:43": "And after the two days he went forth from thence into Galilee.",
    "John 4:44": "For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honor in his own country.",
    "John 4:45": "So when he came into Galilee, the Galilæans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.",
    "John 4:46": "He came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.",
    "John 4:47": "When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judæa into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.",
    "John 4:48": "Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe.",
    "John 4:49": "The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.",
    "John 4:50": "Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spake unto him, and he went his way.",
    "John 4:51": "And as he was now going down, his servants met him, saying, that his son lived.",
    "John 4:52": "So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend. They said therefore unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.",
    "John 4:53": "So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.",
    "John 4:54": "This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judæa into Galilee.",
    "John 5:1": "After these things there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.",
    "John 5:2": "Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches.",
    "John 5:3": "In these lay a multitude of them that were sick, blind, halt, withered.",
    "John 5:4": "",
    "John 5:5": "And a certain man was there, who had been thirty and eight years in his infirmity.",
    "John 5:6": "When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wouldest thou be made whole?",
    "John 5:7": "The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.",
    "John 5:8": "Jesus saith unto him, Arise, take up thy bed, and walk.",
    "John 5:9": "And straightway the man was made whole, and took up his bed and walked.Now it was the sabbath on that day.",
    "John 5:10": "So the Jews said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath, and it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.",
    "John 5:11": "But he answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.",
    "John 5:12": "They asked him, Who is the man that said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?",
    "John 5:13": "But he that was healed knew not who it was; for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in the place.",
    "John 5:14": "Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing befall thee.",
    "John 5:15": "The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole.",
    "John 5:16": "And for this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.",
    "John 5:17": "But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh even until now, and I work.",
    "John 5:18": "For this cause therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only brake the sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.",
    "John 5:19": "Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing: for what things soever he doeth, these the Son also doeth in like manner.",
    "John 5:20": "For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth: and greater works than these will he show him, that ye may marvel.",
    "John 5:21": "For as the Father raiseth the dead and giveth them life, even so the Son also giveth life to whom he will.",
    "John 5:22": "For neither doth the Father judge any man, but he hath given all judgment unto the Son;",
    "John 5:23": "that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father that sent him.",
    "John 5:24": "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath eternal life, and cometh not into judgment, but hath passed out of death into life.",
    "John 5:25": "Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live.",
    "John 5:26": "For as the Father hath life in himself, even so gave he to the Son also to have life in himself:",
    "John 5:27": "and he gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man.",
    "John 5:28": "Marvel not at this: for the hour cometh, in which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice,",
    "John 5:29": "and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.",
    "John 5:30": "I can of myself do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is righteous; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.",
    "John 5:31": "If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.",
    "John 5:32": "It is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.",

    "John 5:34": "But the witness which I receive is not from man: howbeit I say these things, that ye may be saved.",
    "John 5:35": "He was the lamp that burneth and shineth; and ye were willing to rejoice for a season in his light.",
    "John 5:36": "But the witness which I have is greater than that of John; for the works which the Father hath given me to accomplish, the very works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.",
    "John 5:37": "And the Father that sent me, he hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.",

    "John 5:42": "But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in yourselves.",
    "John 5:43": "I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.",
    "John 5:44": "How can ye believe, who receive glory one of another, and the glory that cometh from the only God ye seek not?",
    "John 5:45": "Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, on whom ye have set your hope.",
    "John 5:46": "For if ye believed Moses, ye would believe me; for he wrote of me.",
    "John 5:47": "But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?",
    "John 6:1": "After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.",
    "John 6:2": "And a great multitude followed him, because they beheld the signs which he did on them that were sick.",
    "John 6:3": "And Jesus went up into the mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.",
    "John 6:4": "Now the passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.",
    "John 6:5": "Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude cometh unto him, saith unto Philip, Whence are we to buy bread, that these may eat?",
    "John 6:6": "And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.",
    "John 6:7": "Philip answered him, Two hundred shillings’ worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one may take a little.",
    "John 6:8": "One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, saith unto him,",
    "John 6:9": "There is a lad here, who hath five barley loaves, and two fishes: but what are these among so many?",
    "John 6:10": "Jesus said, Make the people sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.",
    "John 6:11": "Jesus therefore took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to them that were set down; likewise also of the fishes as much as they would.",
    "John 6:12": "And when they were filled, he saith unto his disciples, Gather up the broken pieces which remain over, that nothing be lost.",
    "John 6:13": "So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which remained over unto them that had eaten.",
    "John 6:14": "When therefore the people saw the sign which he did, they said, This is of a truth the prophet that cometh into the world.",

    "John 6:17": "and they entered into a boat, and were going over the sea unto Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.",
    "John 6:18": "And the sea was rising by reason of a great wind that blew.",
    "John 6:19": "When therefore they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they behold Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the boat: and they were afraid.",
    "John 6:20": "But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.",
    "John 6:21": "They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat: and straightway the boat was at the land whither they were going.",
    "John 6:22": "On the morrow the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, save one, and that Jesus entered not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples went away alone",
    "John 6:23": "(howbeit there came boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks):",
    "John 6:24": "when the multitude therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.",
    "John 6:25": "And when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?",
    "John 6:26": "Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but because ye ate of the loaves, and were filled.",
    "John 6:27": "Work not for the food which perisheth, but for the food which abideth unto eternal life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him the Father, even God, hath sealed.",

    "John 6:29": "Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.",
    "John 6:30": "They said therefore unto him, What then doest thou for a sign, that we may see, and believe thee? what workest thou?",
    "John 6:31": "Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.",
    "John 6:32": "Jesus therefore said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, It was not Moses that gave you the bread out of heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread out of heaven.",
    "John 6:33": "For the bread of God is that which cometh down out of heaven, and giveth life unto the world.",
    "John 6:34": "They said therefore unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.",
    "John 6:35": "Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall not hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.",
    "John 6:36": "But I said unto you, that ye have seen me, and yet believe not.",
    "John 6:37": "All that which the Father giveth me shall come unto me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.",
    "John 6:38": "For I am come down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.",
    "John 6:39": "And this is the will of him that sent me, that of all that which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day.",
    "John 6:40": "For this is the will of my Father, that every one that beholdeth the Son, and believeth on him, should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.",
    "John 6:41": "The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said, I am the bread which came down out of heaven.",
    "John 6:42": "And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how doth he now say, I am come down out of heaven?",
    "John 6:43": "Jesus answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.",
    "John 6:44": "No man can come to me, except the Father that sent me draw him: and I will raise him up in the last day.",
    "John 6:45": "It is written in the prophets, And they shall all be taught of God. Every one that hath heard from the Father, and hath learned, cometh unto me.",

    "John 6:47": "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth hath eternal life.",
    "John 6:48": "I am the bread of life.",
    "John 6:49": "Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.",
    "John 6:50": "This is the bread which cometh down out of heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.",
    "John 6:51": "I am the living bread which came down out of heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: yea and the bread which I will give is my flesh, for the life of the world.",

    "John 6:53": "Jesus therefore said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye have not life in yourselves.",
    "John 6:54": "He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life: and I will raise him up at the last day.",
    "John 6:55": "For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.",
    "John 6:56": "He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me, and I in him.",
    "John 6:57": "As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father; so he that eateth me, he also shall live because of me.",
    "John 6:58": "This is the bread which came down out of heaven: not as the fathers ate, and died; he that eateth this bread shall live for ever.",
    "John 6:59": "These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.",
    "John 6:60": "Many therefore of his disciples, when they heard this, said, This is a hard saying; who can hear it?",
    "John 6:61": "But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said unto them, Doth this cause you to stumble?",
    "John 6:62": "What then if ye should behold the Son of man ascending where he was before?",
    "John 6:63": "It is the spirit that giveth life; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I have spoken unto you are spirit, and are life.",
    "John 6:64": "But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who it was that should betray him.",
    "John 6:65": "And he said, For this cause have I said unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it be given unto him of the Father.",

    "John 6:70": "Jesus answered them, Did not I choose you the twelve, and one of you is a devil?",
    "John 6:71": "Now he spake of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot, for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.",
    "John 7:1": "And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judæa, because the Jews sought to kill him.",
    "John 7:2": "Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of tabernacles, was at hand.",
    "John 7:3": "His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judæa, that thy disciples also may behold thy works which thou doest.",
    "John 7:4": "For no man doeth anything in secret, and himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou doest these things, manifest thyself to the world.",
    "John 7:5": "For even his brethren did not believe on him.",
    "John 7:6": "Jesus therefore saith unto them, My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready.",

    "John 7:11": "The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?",
    "John 7:12": "And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him: some said, He is a good man; others said, Not so, but he leadeth the multitude astray.",
    "John 7:13": "Yet no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.",
    "John 7:14": "But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.",
    "John 7:15": "The Jews therefore marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?",
    "John 7:16": "Jesus therefore answered them and said, My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me.",
    "John 7:17": "If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or whether I speak from myself.",
    "John 7:18": "He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.",
    "John 7:19": "Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you doeth the law? Why seek ye to kill me?",
    "John 7:20": "The multitude answered, Thou hast a demon: who seeketh to kill thee?",
    "John 7:21": "Jesus answered and said unto them, I did one work, and ye all marvel because thereof.",
    "John 7:22": "Moses hath given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers); and on the sabbath ye circumcise a man.",
    "John 7:23": "If a man receiveth circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are ye wroth with me, because I made a man every whit whole on the sabbath?",
    "John 7:24": "Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.",
    "John 7:25": "Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?",
    "John 7:26": "And lo, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing unto him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ?",
    "John 7:27": "Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no one knoweth whence he is.",
    "John 7:28": "Jesus therefore cried in the temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me, and know whence I am; and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.",
    "John 7:29": "I know him; because I am from him, and he sent me.",
    "John 7:30": "They sought therefore to take him: and no man laid his hand on him, because his hour was not yet come.",
    "John 7:31": "But of the multitude many believed on him; and they said, When the Christ shall come, will he do more signs than those which this man hath done?",
    "John 7:32": "The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to take him.",
    "John 7:33": "Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while am I with you, and I go unto him that sent me.",
    "John 7:34": "Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come.",
    "John 7:35": "The Jews therefore said among themselves, Whither will this man go that we shall not find him? will he go unto the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?",
    "John 7:36": "What is this word that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, ye cannot come?",
    "John 7:37": "Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.",
    "John 7:38": "He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, from within him shall flow rivers of living water.",
    "John 7:39": "But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believed on him were to receive: for the Spirit was not yet given; because Jesus was not yet glorified.",
    "John 7:40": "Some of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is of a truth the prophet.",
    "John 7:41": "Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, What, doth the Christ come out of Galilee?",
    "John 7:42": "Hath not the scripture said that the Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?",
    "John 7:43": "So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.",
    "John 7:44": "And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.",

    "John 7:50": "Nicodemus saith unto them (he that came to him before, being one of them),",
    "John 7:51": "Doth our law judge a man, except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth?",
    "John 7:52": "They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.",
    "John 7:53": "[And they went every man unto his own house:",
    "John 8:1": "but Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.",
    "John 8:2": "And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.",
    "John 8:3": "And the scribes and the Pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the midst,",
    "John 8:4": "they say unto him, Teacher, this woman hath been taken in adultery, in the very act.",
    "John 8:5": "Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such: what then sayest thou of her?",
    "John 8:6": "And this they said, trying him, that they might have whereof to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.",
    "John 8:7": "But when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.",
    "John 8:8": "And again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.",
    "John 8:9": "And they, when they heard it, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the midst.",
    "John 8:10": "And Jesus lifted up himself, and said unto her, Woman, where are they? did no man condemn thee?",
    "John 8:11": "And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn thee: go thy way; from henceforth sin no more.",
    "John 8:12": "Again therefore Jesus spake unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life.",
    "John 8:13": "The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true.",
    "John 8:14": "Jesus answered and said unto them, Even if I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye know not whence I come, or whither I go.",
    "John 8:15": "Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.",
    "John 8:16": "Yea and if I judge, my judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.",
    "John 8:17": "Yea and in your law it is written, that the witness of two men is true.",
    "John 8:18": "I am he that beareth witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.",

    "John 8:24": "I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.",
    "John 8:25": "They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? Jesus said unto them, Even that which I have also spoken unto you from the beginning.",
    "John 8:26": "I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you: howbeit he that sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these speak I unto the world.",
    "John 8:27": "They perceived not that he spake to them of the Father.",

    "John 8:39": "They answered and said unto him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.",
    "John 8:40": "But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not Abraham.",
    "John 8:41": "Ye do the works of your father. They said unto him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.",
    "John 8:42": "Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I came forth and am come from God; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me.",
    "John 8:43": "Why do ye not understand my speech? Even because ye cannot hear my word.",
    "John 8:44": "Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father it is your will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and standeth not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.",
    "John 8:45": "But because I say the truth, ye believe me not.",

    "John 9:5": "When I am in the world, I am the light of the world.",
    "John 9:6": "When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed his eyes with the clay,",
    "John 9:7": "and said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent). He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing.",
    "John 9:8": "The neighbors therefore, and they that saw him aforetime, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?",
    "John 9:9": "Others said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am he.",
    "John 9:10": "They said therefore unto him, How then were thine eyes opened?",
    "John 9:11": "He answered, The man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to Siloam, and wash: so I went away and washed, and I received sight.",
    "John 9:12": "And they said unto him, Where is he? He saith, I know not.",
    "John 9:13": "They bring to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.",
    "John 9:14": "Now it was the sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.",
    "John 9:15": "Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see.",
    "John 9:16": "Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. But others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them.",
    "John 9:17": "They say therefore unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, in that he opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.",
    "John 9:18": "The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,",
    "John 9:19": "and asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?",
    "John 9:20": "His parents answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:",
    "John 9:21": "but how he now seeth, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he is of age; he shall speak for himself.",
    "John 9:22": "These things said his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.",
    "John 9:23": "Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.",
    "John 9:24": "So they called a second time the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner.",
    "John 9:25": "He therefore answered, Whether he is a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.",
    "John 9:26": "They said therefore unto him, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?",
    "John 9:27": "He answered them, I told you even now, and ye did not hear; wherefore would ye hear it again? would ye also become his disciples?",
    "John 9:28": "And they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are disciples of Moses.",
    "John 9:29": "We know that God hath spoken unto Moses: but as for this man, we know not whence he is.",
    "John 9:30": "The man answered and said unto them, Why, herein is the marvel, that ye know not whence he is, and yet he opened mine eyes.",
    "John 9:31": "We know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth.",
    "John 9:32": "Since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind.",
    "John 9:33": "If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.",
    "John 9:34": "They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.",
    "John 9:35": "Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, he said, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?",
    "John 9:36": "He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?",
    "John 9:37": "Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and he it is that speaketh with thee.",
    "John 9:38": "And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.",
    "John 9:39": "And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world, that they that see not may see; and that they that see may become blind.",
    "John 9:40": "Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said unto him, Are we also blind?",
    "John 9:41": "Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye would have no sin: but now ye say, We see: your sin remaineth.",
    "John 10:1": "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.",
    "John 10:2": "But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.",
    "John 10:3": "To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.",
    "John 10:4": "When he hath put forth all his own, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.",
    "John 10:5": "And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.",
    "John 10:6": "This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.",
    "John 10:7": "Jesus therefore said unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.",
    "John 10:8": "All that came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.",
    "John 10:9": "I am the door; by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out, and shall find pasture.",
    "John 10:10": "The thief cometh not, but that he may steal, and kill, and destroy: I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.",
    "John 10:11": "I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep.",
    "John 10:12": "He that is a hireling, and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, beholdeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth, and the wolf snatcheth them, and scattereth them:",
    "John 10:13": "he fleeth because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep.",
    "John 10:14": "I am the good shepherd; and I know mine own, and mine own know me,",
    "John 10:15": "even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.",
    "John 10:16": "And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice: and they shall become one flock, one shepherd.",
    "John 10:17": "Therefore doth the Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.",
    "John 10:18": "No one taketh it away from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment received I from my Father.",
    "John 10:19": "There arose a division again among the Jews because of these words.",
    "John 10:20": "And many of them said, He hath a demon, and is mad; why hear ye him?",
    "John 10:21": "Others said, These are not the sayings of one possessed with a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?",
    "John 10:22": "And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem:",
    "John 10:23": "it was winter; and Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon’s porch.",
    "John 10:24": "The Jews therefore came round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou hold us in suspense? If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly.",
    "John 10:25": "Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believe not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, these bear witness of me.",
    "John 10:26": "But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep.",
    "John 10:27": "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:",
    "John 10:28": "and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand.",
    "John 10:29": "My Father, who hath given them unto me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand.",
    "John 10:30": "I and the Father are one.",
    "John 10:31": "The Jews took up stones again to stone him.",
    "John 10:32": "Jesus answered them, Many good works have I showed you from the Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?",
    "John 10:33": "The Jews answered him, For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.",
    "John 10:34": "Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?",
    "John 10:35": "If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken),",
    "John 10:36": "say ye of him, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?",
    "John 10:37": "If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.",
    "John 10:38": "But if I do them, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.",
    "John 10:39": "They sought again to take him: and he went forth out of their hand.",
    "John 10:40": "And he went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was at the first baptizing; and there he abode.",
    "John 10:41": "And many came unto him; and they said, John indeed did no sign: but all things whatsoever John spake of this man were true.",
    "John 10:42": "And many believed on him there.",
    "John 11:1": "Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister Martha.",
    "John 11:2": "And it was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.",
    "John 11:3": "The sisters therefore sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.",
    "John 11:4": "But when Jesus heard it, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby.",
    "John 11:5": "Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.",
    "John 11:6": "When therefore he heard that he was sick, he abode at that time two days in the place where he was.",
    "John 11:7": "Then after this he saith to the disciples, Let us go into Judæa again.",
    "John 11:8": "The disciples say unto him, Rabbi, the Jews were but now seeking to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?",
    "John 11:9": "Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.",
    "John 11:10": "But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.",
    "John 11:11": "These things spake he: and after this he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus is fallen asleep; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.",
    "John 11:12": "The disciples therefore said unto him, Lord, if he is fallen asleep, he will recover.",
    "John 11:13": "Now Jesus had spoken of his death: but they thought that he spake of taking rest in sleep.",
    "John 11:14": "Then Jesus therefore said unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.",
    "John 11:15": "And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.",
    "John 11:16": "Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said unto his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.",
    "John 11:17": "So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already.",
    "John 11:18": "Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off;",
    "John 11:19": "and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.",
    "John 11:20": "Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary still sat in the house.",
    "John 11:21": "Martha therefore said unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.",
    "John 11:22": "And even now I know that, whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee.",
    "John 11:23": "Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.",
    "John 11:24": "Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.",
    "John 11:25": "Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth on me, though he die, yet shall he live;",
    "John 11:26": "and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die. Believest thou this?",
    "John 11:27": "She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I have believed that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, even he that cometh into the world.",
    "John 11:28": "And when she had said this, she went away, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is here, and calleth thee.",
    "John 11:29": "And she, when she heard it, arose quickly, and went unto him.",
    "John 11:30": "(Now Jesus was not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met him.)",
    "John 11:31": "The Jews then who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going unto the tomb to weep there.",
    "John 11:32": "Mary therefore, when she came where Jesus was, and saw him, fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.",
    "John 11:33": "When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,",
    "John 11:34": "and said, Where have ye laid him? They say unto him, Lord, come and see.",
    "John 11:35": "Jesus wept.",
    "John 11:36": "The Jews therefore said, Behold how he loved him!",
    "John 11:37": "But some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of him that was blind, have caused that this man also should not die?",
    "John 11:38": "Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.",
    "John 11:39": "Jesus saith, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time the body decayeth; for he hath been dead four days.",
    "John 11:40": "Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou believedst, thou shouldest see the glory of God?",
    "John 11:41": "So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou heardest me.",
    "John 11:42": "And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the multitude that standeth around I said it, that they may believe that thou didst send me.",
    "John 11:43": "And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.",
    "John 11:44": "He that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.",
    "John 11:45": "Many therefore of the Jews, who came to Mary and beheld that which he did, believed on him.",
    "John 11:46": "But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done.",
    "John 11:47": "The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many signs.",
    "John 11:48": "If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.",
    "John 11:49": "But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,",
    "John 11:50": "nor do ye take account that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.",
    "John 11:51": "Now this he said not of himself: but, being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;",
    "John 11:52": "and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God that are scattered abroad.",
    "John 11:53": "So from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him to death.",
    "John 11:54": "Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed thence into the country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim; and there he tarried with the disciples.",
    "John 11:55": "Now the passover of the Jews was at hand: and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, to purify themselves.",
    "John 11:56": "They sought therefore for Jesus, and spake one with another, as they stood in the temple, What think ye? That he will not come to the feast?",
    "John 11:57": "Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment, that, if any man knew where he was, he should show it, that they might take him.",
    "John 12:1": "Jesus therefore six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead.",
    "John 12:2": "So they made him a supper there: and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of them that sat at meat with him.",
    "John 12:3": "Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.",
    "John 12:4": "But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, that should betray him, saith,",
    "John 12:5": "Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred shillings, and given to the poor?",
    "John 12:6": "Now this he said, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the bag took away what was put therein.",
    "John 12:7": "Jesus therefore said, Suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying.",
    "John 12:8": "For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have not always.",
    "John 12:9": "The common people therefore of the Jews learned that he was there: and they came, not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.",
    "John 12:10": "But the chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus also to death;",
    "John 12:11": "because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.",
    "John 12:12": "On the morrow a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,",
    "John 12:13": "took the branches of the palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel.",
    "John 12:14": "And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,",
    "John 12:15": "Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt.",
    "John 12:16": "These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.",
    "John 12:17": "The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bare witness.",
    "John 12:18": "For this cause also the multitude went and met him, for that they heard that he had done this sign.",
    "John 12:19": "The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Behold how ye prevail nothing: lo, the world is gone after him.",
    "John 12:20": "Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast:",
    "John 12:21": "these therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.",
    "John 12:22": "Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: Andrew cometh, and Philip, and they tell Jesus.",
    "John 12:23": "And Jesus answereth them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.",
    "John 12:24": "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it abideth by itself alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit.",
    "John 12:25": "He that loveth his life loseth it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.",
    "John 12:26": "If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will the Father honor.",
    "John 12:27": "Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause came I unto this hour.",
    "John 12:28": "Father, glorify thy name. There came therefore a voice out of heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.",
    "John 12:29": "The multitude therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it had thundered: others said, An angel hath spoken to him.",
    "John 12:30": "Jesus answered and said, This voice hath not come for my sake, but for your sakes.",
    "John 12:31": "Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.",
    "John 12:32": "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto myself.",
    "John 12:33": "But this he said, signifying by what manner of death he should die.",
    "John 12:34": "The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?",
    "John 12:35": "Jesus therefore said unto them, Yet a little while is the light among you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness overtake you not: and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.",
    "John 12:36": "While ye have the light, believe on the light, that ye may become sons of light. These things spake Jesus, and he departed and hid himself from them.",
    "John 12:37": "But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they believed not on him:",
    "John 12:38": "that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?",
    "John 12:39": "For this cause they could not believe, for that Isaiah said again,",
    "John 12:40": "He hath blinded their eyes, and he hardened their heart; Lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, And should turn, And I should heal them.",
    "John 12:41": "These things said Isaiah, because he saw his glory; and he spake of him.",
    "John 12:42": "Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess it, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:",
    "John 12:43": "for they loved the glory that is of men more than the glory that is of God.",
    "John 12:44": "And Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.",
    "John 12:45": "And he that beholdeth me beholdeth him that sent me.",
    "John 12:46": "I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me may not abide in the darkness.",
    "John 12:47": "And if any man hear my sayings, and keep them not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.",
    "John 12:48": "He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my sayings, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I spake, the same shall judge him in the last day.",
    "John 12:49": "For I spake not from myself; but the Father that sent me, he hath given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.",
    "John 12:50": "And I know that his commandment is life eternal: the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father hath said unto me, so I speak.",
    "John 13:1": "Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus knowing that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto his Father, having loved his own that were in the world, he loved them unto the end.",
    "John 13:2": "And during supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray him,",
    "John 13:3": "Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he came forth from God, and goeth unto God,",
    "John 13:4": "riseth from supper, and layeth aside his garments; and he took a towel, and girded himself.",
    "John 13:5": "Then he poureth water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.",
    "John 13:6": "So he cometh to Simon Peter. He saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?",
    "John 13:7": "Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt understand hereafter.",
    "John 13:8": "Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.",
    "John 13:9": "Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.",
    "John 13:10": "Jesus saith to him, He that is bathed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.",
    "John 13:11": "For he knew him that should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.",
    "John 13:12": "So when he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and sat down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?",
    "John 13:13": "Ye call me, Teacher, and, Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.",
    "John 13:14": "If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another’s feet.",
    "John 13:15": "For I have given you an example, that ye also should do as I have done to you.",
    "John 13:16": "Verily, verily, I say unto you, a servant is not greater than his lord; neither one that is sent greater than he that sent him.",

    "John 18:12": "So the band and the chief captain, and the officers of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him,",
    "John 18:13": "and led him to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.",

    "John 18:21": "Why askest thou me? ask them that have heard me, what I spake unto them: behold, these know the things which I said.",
    "John 18:22": "And when he had said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?",

    "John 18:33": "Pilate therefore entered again into the Prætorium, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?",
    "John 18:34": "Jesus answered, Sayest thou this of thyself, or did others tell it thee concerning me?",
    "John 18:35": "Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?",
    "John 18:36": "Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.",

    "Acts 24:10": "And when the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, Paul answered,Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I cheerfully make my defense:",
    "Acts 24:11": "seeing that thou canst take knowledge that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem:",
    "Acts 24:12": "and neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city.",
    "Acts 24:13": "Neither can they prove to thee the things whereof they now accuse me.",
    "Acts 24:14": "But this I confess unto thee, that after the Way which they call a sect, so serve I the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;",

    "Acts 25:12": "Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Thou hast appealed unto Cæsar: unto Cæsar shalt thou go.",
    "Acts 25:13": "Now when certain days were passed, Agrippa the King and Bernice arrived at Cæsarea, and saluted Festus.",
    "Acts 25:14": "And as they tarried there many days, Festus laid Paul’s case before the King, saying, There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix;",
    "Acts 25:15": "about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, asking for sentence against him.",
    "Acts 25:16": "To whom I answered, that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man, before that the accused have the accusers face to face, and have had opportunity to make his defense concerning the matter laid against him.",
    "Acts 25:17": "When therefore they were come together here, I made no delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded the man to be brought.",
    "Acts 25:18": "Concerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such evil things as I supposed;",
    "Acts 25:19": "but had certain questions against him of their own religion, and of one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.",
    "Acts 25:20": "And I, being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things, asked whether he would go to Jerusalem and there be judged of these matters.",
    "Acts 25:21": "But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept till I should send him to Cæsar.",

    "Acts 25:23": "So on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and they were entered into the place of hearing with the chief captains and principal men of the city, at the command of Festus Paul was brought in.",
    "Acts 25:24": "And Festus saith, King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, ye behold this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews made suit to me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.",
    "Acts 25:25": "But I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death: and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined to send him.",
    "Acts 25:26": "Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I may have somewhat to write.",
    "Acts 25:27": "For it seemeth to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not withal to signify the charges against him.",
    "Acts 26:1": "And Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth his hand, and made his defence:",
    "Acts 26:2": "I think myself happy, king Agrippa, that I am to make my defence before thee this day touching all the things whereof I am accused by the Jews:",
    "Acts 26:3": "especially because thou art expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.",
    "Acts 26:4": "My manner of life then from my youth up, which was from the beginning among mine own nation and at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;",
    "Acts 26:5": "having knowledge of me from the first, if they be willing to testify, that after the straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.",
    "Acts 26:6": "And now I stand here to be judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers;",
    "Acts 26:7": "unto which promise our twelve tribes, earnestly serving God night and day, hope to attain. And concerning this hope I am accused by the Jews, O king!",
    "Acts 26:8": "Why is it judged incredible with you, if God doth raise the dead?",
    "Acts 26:9": "I verily thought with myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.",
    "Acts 26:10": "And this I also did in Jerusalem: and I both shut up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests, and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them.",
    "Acts 26:11": "And punishing them oftentimes in all the synagogues, I strove to make them blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto foreign cities.",
    "Acts 26:12": "Whereupon as I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests,",
    "Acts 26:13": "at midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them that journeyed with me.",
    "Acts 26:14": "And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice saying unto me in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the goad.",
    "Acts 26:15": "And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.",
    "Acts 26:16": "But arise, and stand upon thy feet: for to this end have I appeared unto thee, to appoint thee a minister and a witness both of the things wherein thou hast seen me, and of the things wherein I will appear unto thee;",

    "Acts 26:24": "And as he thus made his defence, Festus saith with a loud voice, Paul, thou art mad; thy much learning is turning thee mad.",
    "Acts 26:25": "But Paul saith, I am not mad, most excellent Festus; but speak forth words of truth and soberness.",
    "Acts 26:26": "For the king knoweth of these things, unto whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him; for this hath not been done in a corner.",
    "Acts 26:27": "King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.",
    "Acts 26:28": "And Agrippa said unto Paul, With but little persuasion thou wouldest fain make me a Christian.",
    "Acts 26:29": "And Paul said, I would to God, that whether with little or with much, not thou only, but also all that hear me this day, might become such as I am, except these bonds.",
    "Acts 26:30": "And the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:",

    "Acts 27:1": "And when it was determined that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan band.",
    "Acts 27:2": "And embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail unto the places on the coast of Asia, we put to sea, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.",

    "Acts 27:10": "and said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the lading and the ship, but also of our lives.",
    "Acts 27:11": "But the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship, than to those things which were spoken by Paul.",
    "Acts 27:12": "And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to put to sea from thence, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, and winter there; which is a haven of Crete, looking north-east and south-east.",

    "Acts 27:31": "Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.",
    "Acts 27:32": "Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.",

    "Romans 1:28": "And even as they refused to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up unto a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting;",
    "Romans 1:29": "being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity; whisperers,",
    "Romans 1:30": "backbiters, hateful to God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,",
    "Romans 1:31": "without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, unmerciful:",
    "Romans 1:32": "who, knowing the ordinance of God, that they that practise such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also consent with them that practise them.",
    "Romans 2:1": "Wherefore thou art without excuse, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest dost practise the same things.",
    "Romans 2:2": "And we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against them that practise such things.",
    "Romans 2:3": "And reckonest thou this, O man, who judgest them that practise such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?",
    "Romans 2:4": "Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?",
    "Romans 2:5": "but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up for thyself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;",
    "Romans 2:6": "who will render to every man according to his works:",
    "Romans 2:7": "to them that by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and incorruption, eternal life:",
    "Romans 2:8": "but unto them that are factious, and obey not the truth, but obey unrighteousness, shall be wrath and indignation,",
    "Romans 2:9": "tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek;",
    "Romans 2:10": "but glory and honor and peace to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek:",
    "Romans 2:11": "for there is no respect of persons with God.",
    "Romans 2:12": "For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without the law: and as many as have sinned under the law shall be judged by the law;",
    "Romans 2:13": "for not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified:",
    "Romans 2:14": "(for when Gentiles that have not the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are the law unto themselves;",
    "Romans 2:15": "in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness therewith, and their thoughts one with another accusing or else excusing them);",
    "Romans 2:16": "in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men, according to my gospel, by Jesus Christ.",
    "Romans 2:17": "But if thou bearest the name of a Jew, and restest upon the law, and gloriest in God,",
    "Romans 2:18": "and knowest his will, and approvest the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,",
    "Romans 2:19": "and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness,",
    "Romans 2:20": "a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth;",
    "Romans 2:21": "thou therefore that teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?",
    "Romans 2:22": "thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou rob temples?",
    "Romans 2:23": "thou who gloriest in the law, through thy transgression of the law dishonorest thou God?",
    "Romans 2:24": "For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you, even as it is written.",
    "Romans 2:25": "For circumcision indeed profiteth, if thou be a doer of the law: but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is become uncircumcision.",
    "Romans 2:26": "If therefore the uncircumcision keep the ordinances of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision?",
    "Romans 2:27": "and shall not the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who with the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law?",
    "Romans 2:28": "For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh:",
    "Romans 2:29": "but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.",
    "Romans 3:1": "What advantage then hath the Jew? or what is the profit of circumcision?",
    "Romans 3:2": "Much every way: first of all, that they were intrusted with the oracles of God.",
    "Romans 3:3": "For what if some were without faith? shall their want of faith make of none effect the faithfulness of God?",
    "Romans 3:4": "God forbid: yea, let God be found true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy words, And mightest prevail when thou comest into judgment.",
    "Romans 3:5": "But if our unrighteousness commendeth the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who visiteth with wrath? (I speak after the manner of men.)",
    "Romans 3:6": "God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?",
    "Romans 3:7": "But if the truth of God through my lie abounded unto his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?",
    "Romans 3:8": "and why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil, that good may come? whose condemnation is just.",
    "Romans 3:9": "What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we before laid to the charge both of Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin;",
    "Romans 3:10": "as it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one;",
    "Romans 3:11": "There is none that understandeth, There is none that seeketh after God;",
    "Romans 3:12": "They have all turned aside, they are together become unprofitable; There is none that doeth good, no, not so much as one:",

    "Romans 3:19": "Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it speaketh to them that are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God:",
    "Romans 3:20": "because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight; for through the law cometh the knowledge of sin.",
    "Romans 3:21": "But now apart from the law a righteousness of God hath been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;",
    "Romans 3:22": "even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ unto all them that believe; for there is no distinction;",
    "Romans 3:23": "for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;",
    "Romans 3:24": "being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:",
    "Romans 3:25": "whom God set forth to be a propitiation, through faith, in his blood, to show his righteousness because of the passing over of the sins done aforetime, in the forbearance of God;",
    "Romans 3:26": "for the showing, I say, of his righteousness at this present season: that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him that hath faith in Jesus.",
    "Romans 3:27": "Where then is the glorying? It is excluded. By what manner of law? of works? Nay: but by a law of faith.",
    "Romans 3:28": "We reckon therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.",
    "Romans 3:29": "Or is God the God of Jews only? is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yea, of Gentiles also:",
    "Romans 3:30": "if so be that God is one, and he shall justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.",
    "Romans 3:31": "Do we then make the law of none effect through faith? God forbid: nay, we establish the law.",
    "Romans 4:1": "What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, hath found according to the flesh?",
    "Romans 4:2": "For if Abraham was justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not toward God.",
    "Romans 4:3": "For what saith the scripture? And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.",
    "Romans 4:4": "Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned as of grace, but as of debt.",
    "Romans 4:5": "But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reckoned for righteousness.",
    "Romans 4:6": "Even as David also pronounceth blessing upon the man, unto whom God reckoneth righteousness apart from works,",
    "Romans 4:7": "saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, And whose sins are covered.",
    "Romans 4:8": "Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not reckon sin.",
    "Romans 4:9": "Is this blessing then pronounced upon the circumcision, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say, To Abraham his faith was reckoned for righteousness.",
    "Romans 4:10": "How then was it reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision:",
    "Romans 4:11": "and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be in uncircumcision, that righteousness might be reckoned unto them;",
    "Romans 4:12": "and the father of circumcision to them who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he had in uncircumcision.",
    "Romans 4:13": "For not through the law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed that he should be heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith.",
    "Romans 4:14": "For if they that are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of none effect:",
    "Romans 4:15": "for the law worketh wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there transgression.",
    "Romans 4:16": "For this cause it is of faith, that it may be according to grace; to the end that the promise may be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all",
    "Romans 4:17": "(as it is written, A father of many nations have I made thee) before him whom he believed, even God, who giveth life to the dead, and calleth the things that are not, as though they were.",
    "Romans 4:18": "Who in hope believed against hope, to the end that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, So shall thy seed be.",
    "Romans 4:19": "And without being weakened in faith he considered his own body now as good as dead (he being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah’s womb;",
    "Romans 4:20": "yet, looking unto the promise of God, he wavered not through unbelief, but waxed strong through faith, giving glory to God,",
    "Romans 4:21": "and being fully assured that what he had promised, he was able also to perform.",
    "Romans 4:22": "Wherefore also it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.",
    "Romans 4:23": "Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was reckoned unto him;",
    "Romans 4:24": "but for our sake also, unto whom it shall be reckoned, who believe on him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,",
    "Romans 4:25": "who was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification.",
    "Romans 5:1": "Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ;",
    "Romans 5:2": "through whom also we have had our access by faith into this grace wherein we stand; and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.",
    "Romans 5:3": "And not only so, but we also rejoice in our tribulations: knowing that tribulation worketh stedfastness;",
    "Romans 5:4": "and stedfastness, approvedness; and approvedness, hope:",
    "Romans 5:5": "and hope putteth not to shame; because the love of God hath been shed abroad in our hearts through the Holy Spirit which was given unto us.",
    "Romans 5:6": "For while we were yet weak, in due season Christ died for the ungodly.",
    "Romans 5:7": "For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: for peradventure for the good man some one would even dare to die.",
    "Romans 5:8": "But God commendeth his own love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.",
    "Romans 5:9": "Much more then, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from the wrath of God through him.",
    "Romans 5:10": "For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life;",
    "Romans 5:11": "and not only so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.",
    "Romans 5:12": "Therefore, as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin; and so death passed unto all men, for that all sinned:—",
    "Romans 5:13": "for until the law sin was in the world; but sin is not imputed when there is no law.",
    "Romans 5:14": "Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam’s transgression, who is a figure of him that was to come.",
    "Romans 5:15": "But not as the trespass, so also is the free gift. For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound unto the many.",
    "Romans 5:16": "And not as through one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment came of one unto condemnation, but the free gift came of many trespasses unto justification.",
    "Romans 5:17": "For if, by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one; much more shall they that receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, even Jesus Christ.",
    "Romans 5:18": "So then as through one trespass the judgment came unto all men to condemnation; even so through one act of righteousness the free gift came unto all men to justification of life.",
    "Romans 5:19": "For as through the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one shall the many be made righteous.",
    "Romans 5:20": "And the law came in besides, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace did abound more exceedingly:",
    "Romans 5:21": "that, as sin reigned in death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.",
    "Romans 6:1": "What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?",
    "Romans 6:2": "God forbid. We who died to sin, how shall we any longer live therein?",
    "Romans 6:3": "Or are ye ignorant that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?",
    "Romans 6:4": "We were buried therefore with him through baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life.",
    "Romans 6:5": "For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection;",
    "Romans 6:6": "knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be done away, that so we should no longer be in bondage to sin;",
    "Romans 6:7": "for he that hath died is justified from sin.",
    "Romans 6:8": "But if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him;",
    "Romans 6:9": "knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death no more hath dominion over him.",
    "Romans 6:10": "For the death that he died, he died unto sin once: but the life that he liveth, he liveth unto God.",
    "Romans 6:11": "Even so reckon ye also yourselves to be dead unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus.",
    "Romans 6:12": "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof:",
    "Romans 6:13": "neither present your members unto sin as instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves unto God, as alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.",
    "Romans 6:14": "For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under law, but under grace.",
    "Romans 6:15": "What then? shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? God forbid.",
    "Romans 6:16": "Know ye not, that to whom ye present yourselves as servants unto obedience, his servants ye are whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?",
    "Romans 6:17": "But thanks be to God, that, whereas ye were servants of sin, ye became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto ye were delivered;",
    "Romans 6:18": "and being made free from sin, ye became servants of righteousness.",
    "Romans 6:19": "I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity, even so now present your members as servants to righteousness unto sanctification.",
    "Romans 6:20": "For when ye were servants of sin, ye were free in regard of righteousness.",
    "Romans 6:21": "What fruit then had ye at that time in the things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.",
    "Romans 6:22": "But now being made free from sin and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life.",
    "Romans 6:23": "For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.",
    "Romans 7:1": "Or are ye ignorant, brethren (for I speak to men who know the law), that the law hath dominion over a man for so long time as he liveth?",
    "Romans 7:2": "For the woman that hath a husband is bound by law to the husband while he liveth; but if the husband die, she is discharged from the law of the husband.",
    "Romans 7:3": "So then if, while the husband liveth, she be joined to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if the husband die, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she be joined to another man.",
    "Romans 7:4": "Wherefore, my brethren, ye also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ; that ye should be joined to another, even to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit unto God.",
    "Romans 7:5": "For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were through the law, wrought in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.",
    "Romans 7:6": "But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that wherein we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.",
    "Romans 7:7": "What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Howbeit, I had not known sin, except through the law: for I had not known coveting, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet:",
    "Romans 7:8": "but sin, finding occasion, wrought in me through the commandment all manner of coveting: for apart from the law sin is dead.",
    "Romans 7:9": "And I was alive apart from the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died;",
    "Romans 7:10": "and the commandment, which was unto life, this I found to be unto death:",
    "Romans 7:11": "for sin, finding occasion, through the commandment beguiled me, and through it slew me.",
    "Romans 7:12": "So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good.",
    "Romans 7:13": "Did then that which is good become death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, by working death to me through that which is good;—that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful.",
    "Romans 7:14": "For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.",
    "Romans 7:15": "For that which I do I know not: for not what I would, that do I practise; but what I hate, that I do.",
    "Romans 7:16": "But if what I would not, that I do, I consent unto the law that it is good.",
    "Romans 7:17": "So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me.",
    "Romans 7:18": "For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me, but to do that which is good is not.",
    "Romans 7:19": "For the good which I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I practise.",
    "Romans 7:20": "But if what I would not, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me.",
    "Romans 7:21": "I find then the law, that, to me who would do good, evil is present.",
    "Romans 7:22": "For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:",
    "Romans 7:23": "but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members.",
    "Romans 7:24": "Wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me out of the body of this death?",
    "Romans 7:25": "I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then I of myself with the mind, indeed, serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.",
    "Romans 8:1": "There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.",
    "Romans 8:2": "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death.",
    "Romans 8:3": "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:",
    "Romans 8:4": "that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.",
    "Romans 8:5": "For they that are after the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.",
    "Romans 8:6": "For the mind of the flesh is death; but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace:",
    "Romans 8:7": "because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be:",
    "Romans 8:8": "and they that are in the flesh cannot please God.",
    "Romans 8:9": "But ye are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you. But if any man hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.",
    "Romans 8:10": "And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness.",
    "Romans 8:11": "But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you, he that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead shall give life also to your mortal bodies through his Spirit that dwelleth in you.",
    "Romans 8:12": "So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh:",
    "Romans 8:13": "for if ye live after the flesh, ye must die; but if by the Spirit ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live.",
    "Romans 8:14": "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.",
    "Romans 8:15": "For ye received not the spirit of bondage again unto fear; but ye received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.",
    "Romans 8:16": "The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are children of God:",
    "Romans 8:17": "and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified with him.",
    "Romans 8:18": "For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed to us-ward.",
    "Romans 8:19": "For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the revealing of the sons of God.",
    "Romans 8:20": "For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but by reason of him who subjected it, in hope",
    "Romans 8:21": "that the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.",
    "Romans 8:22": "For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.",
    "Romans 8:23": "And not only so, but ourselves also, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for our adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.",
    "Romans 8:24": "For in hope were we saved: but hope that is seen is not hope: for who hopeth for that which he seeth?",
    "Romans 8:25": "But if we hope for that which we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.",
    "Romans 8:26": "And in like manner the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity: for we know not how to pray as we ought; but the Spirit himself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered;",
    "Romans 8:27": "and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.",
    "Romans 8:28": "And we know that to them that love God all things work together for good, even to them that are called according to his purpose.",
    "Romans 8:29": "For whom he foreknew, he also foreordained to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren:",
    "Romans 8:30": "and whom he foreordained, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.",
    "Romans 8:31": "What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?",
    "Romans 8:32": "He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him freely give us all things?",
    "Romans 8:33": "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth;",
    "Romans 8:34": "who is he that condemneth? It is Christ Jesus that died, yea rather, that was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.",
    "Romans 8:35": "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?",
    "Romans 8:36": "Even as it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter.",
    "Romans 8:37": "Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.",
    "Romans 8:38": "For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,",
    "Romans 8:39": "nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.",
    "Romans 9:1": "I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit,",
    "Romans 9:2": "that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.",
    "Romans 9:3": "For I could wish that I myself were anathema from Christ for my brethren’s sake, my kinsmen according to the flesh:",
    "Romans 9:4": "who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;",
    "Romans 9:5": "whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.",
    "Romans 9:6": "But it is not as though the word of God hath come to nought. For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel:",
    "Romans 9:7": "neither, because they are Abraham’s seed, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.",
    "Romans 9:8": "That is, it is not the children of the flesh that are children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned for a seed.",
    "Romans 9:9": "For this is a word of promise, According to this season will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.",
    "Romans 9:10": "And not only so; but Rebecca also having conceived by one, even by our father Isaac—",
    "Romans 9:11": "for the children being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth,",
    "Romans 9:12": "it was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.",
    "Romans 9:13": "Even as it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.",
    "Romans 9:14": "What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.",
    "Romans 9:15": "For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.",
    "Romans 9:16": "So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that hath mercy.",
    "Romans 9:17": "For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, For this very purpose did I raise thee up, that I might show in thee my power, and that my name might be published abroad in all the earth.",
    "Romans 9:18": "So then he hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will be hardeneth.",
    "Romans 9:19": "Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he still find fault? For who withstandeth his will?",
    "Romans 9:20": "Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why didst thou make me thus?",
    "Romans 9:21": "Or hath not the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor?",
    "Romans 9:22": "What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering vessels of wrath fitted unto destruction:",
    "Romans 9:23": "and that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he afore prepared unto glory,",
    "Romans 9:24": "even us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?",
    "Romans 9:25": "As he saith also in Hosea, I will call that my people, which was not my people; And her beloved, that was not beloved.",
    "Romans 9:26": "And it shall be, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, There shall they be called sons of the living God.",
    "Romans 9:27": "And Isaiah crieth concerning Israel, If the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant that shall be saved:",
    "Romans 9:28": "for the Lord will execute his word upon the earth, finishing it and cutting it short.",
    "Romans 9:29": "And, as Isaiah hath said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, We had become as Sodom, and had been made like unto Gomorrah.",
    "Romans 9:30": "What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who followed not after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith:",
    "Romans 9:31": "but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, did not arrive at that law.",
    "Romans 9:32": "Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by works. They stumbled at the stone of stumbling;",
    "Romans 9:33": "even as it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence: And he that believeth on him shall not be put to shame.",
    "Romans 10:1": "Brethren, my heart’s desire and my supplication to God is for them, that they may be saved.",
    "Romans 10:2": "For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.",
    "Romans 10:3": "For being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.",
    "Romans 10:4": "For Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to every one that believeth.",
    "Romans 10:5": "For Moses writeth that the man that doeth the righteousness which is of the law shall live thereby.",
    "Romans 10:6": "But the righteousness which is of faith saith thus, Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down:)",
    "Romans 10:7": "or, Who shall descend into the abyss? (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)",
    "Romans 10:8": "But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach:",
    "Romans 10:9": "because if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord, and shalt believe in thy heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved:",
    "Romans 10:10": "for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.",
    "Romans 10:11": "For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be put to shame.",
    "Romans 10:12": "For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek: for the same Lord is Lord of all, and is rich unto all that call upon him:",
    "Romans 10:13": "for, Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.",
    "Romans 10:14": "How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?",
    "Romans 10:15": "and how shall they preach, except they be sent? even as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad tidings of good things!",
    "Romans 10:16": "But they did not all hearken to the glad tidings. For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?",
    "Romans 10:17": "So belief cometh of hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.",
    "Romans 10:18": "But I say, Did they not hear? Yea, verily, Their sound went out into all the earth, And their words unto the ends of the world.",
    "Romans 10:19": "But I say, Did Israel not know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation, With a nation void of understanding will I anger you.",
    "Romans 10:20": "And Isaiah is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I became manifest unto them that asked not of me.",
    "Romans 10:21": "But as to Israel he saith, All the day long did I spread out my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.",
    "Romans 11:1": "I say then, Did God cast off his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.",
    "Romans 11:2": "God did not cast off his people which he foreknew. Or know ye not what the scripture saith of Elijah? how he pleadeth with God against Israel:",
    "Romans 11:3": "Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.",
    "Romans 11:4": "But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have left for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.",
    "Romans 11:5": "Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.",
    "Romans 11:6": "But if it is by grace, it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace.",
    "Romans 11:7": "What then? That which Israel seeketh for, that he obtained not; but the election obtained it, and the rest were hardened:",
    "Romans 11:8": "according as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this very day.",
    "Romans 11:9": "And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, And a stumblingblock, and a recompense unto them:",
    "Romans 11:10": "Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, And bow thou down their back always.",
    "Romans 11:11": "I say then, Did they stumble that they might fall? God forbid: but by their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.",
    "Romans 11:12": "Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?",
    "Romans 11:13": "But I speak to you that are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;",
    "Romans 11:14": "if by any means I may provoke to jealousy them that are my flesh, and may save some of them.",
    "Romans 11:15": "For if the casting away of them is the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?",
    "Romans 11:16": "And if the firstfruit is holy, so is the lump: and if the root is holy, so are the branches.",
    "Romans 11:17": "But if some of the branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive, wast grafted in among them, and didst become partaker with them of the root of the fatness of the olive tree;",
    "Romans 11:18": "glory not over the branches: but if thou gloriest, it is not thou that bearest the root, but the root thee.",
    "Romans 11:19": "Thou wilt say then, Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.",
    "Romans 11:20": "Well; by their unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by thy faith. Be not highminded, but fear:",
    "Romans 11:21": "for if God spared not the natural branches, neither will he spare thee.",
    "Romans 11:22": "Behold then the goodness and severity of God: toward them that fell, severity; but toward thee, God’s goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.",
    "Romans 11:23": "And they also, if they continue not in their unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.",
    "Romans 11:24": "For if thou wast cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and wast grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree; how much more shall these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?",
    "Romans 11:25": "For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant of this mystery, lest ye be wise in your own conceits, that a hardening in part hath befallen Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in;",
    "Romans 11:26": "and so all Israel shall be saved: even as it is written, There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer; He shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:",
    "Romans 11:27": "And this is my covenant unto them, When I shall take away their sins.",
    "Romans 11:28": "As touching the gospel, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sake.",
    "Romans 11:29": "For the gifts and the calling of God are not repented of.",
    "Romans 11:30": "For as ye in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,",
    "Romans 11:31": "even so have these also now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they also may now obtain mercy.",
    "Romans 11:32": "For God hath shut up all unto disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.",
    "Romans 11:33": "O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!",
    "Romans 11:34": "For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?",
    "Romans 11:35": "or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?",
    "Romans 11:36": "For of him, and through him, and unto him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever. Amen.",
    "Romans 12:1": "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service.",
    "Romans 12:2": "And be not fashioned according to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.",
    "Romans 12:3": "For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but so to think as to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to each man a measure of faith.",
    "Romans 12:4": "For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members have not the same office:",
    "Romans 12:5": "so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of another.",
    "Romans 12:6": "And having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith;",
    "Romans 12:7": "or ministry, let us give ourselves to our ministry; or he that teacheth, to his teaching;",
    "Romans 12:8": "or he that exhorteth, to his exhorting: he that giveth, let him do it with liberality; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness.",
    "Romans 12:9": "Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.",
    "Romans 12:10": "In love of the brethren be tenderly affectioned one to another; in honor preferring one another;",
    "Romans 12:11": "in diligence not slothful; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;",
    "Romans 12:12": "rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing stedfastly in prayer;",
    "Romans 12:13": "communicating to the necessities of the saints; given to hospitality.",
    "Romans 12:14": "Bless them that persecute you; bless, and curse not.",
    "Romans 12:15": "Rejoice with them that rejoice; weep with them that weep.",
    "Romans 12:16": "Be of the same mind one toward another. Set not your mind on high things, but condescend to things that are lowly. Be not wise in your own conceits.",
    "Romans 12:17": "Render to no man evil for evil. Take thought for things honorable in the sight of all men.",
    "Romans 12:18": "If it be possible, as much as in you lieth, be at peace with all men.",
    "Romans 12:19": "Avenge not yourselves, beloved, but give place unto the wrath of God: for it is written, Vengeance belongeth unto me; I will recompense, saith the Lord.",
    "Romans 12:20": "But if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him to drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.",
    "Romans 12:21": "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.",
    "Romans 13:1": "Let every soul be in subjection to the higher powers: for there is no power but of God; and the powers that be are ordained of God.",
    "Romans 13:2": "Therefore he that resisteth the power, withstandeth the ordinance of God: and they that withstand shall receive to themselves judgment.",
    "Romans 13:3": "For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. And wouldest thou have no fear of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise from the same:",
    "Romans 13:4": "for he is a minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is a minister of God, an avenger for wrath to him that doeth evil.",
    "Romans 13:5": "Wherefore ye must needs be in subjection, not only because of the wrath, but also for conscience’ sake.",
    "Romans 13:6": "For this cause ye pay tribute also; for they are ministers of God’s service, attending continually upon this very thing.",
    "Romans 13:7": "Render to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.",
    "Romans 13:8": "Owe no man anything, save to love one another: for he that loveth his neighbor hath fulfilled the law.",
    "Romans 13:9": "For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not covet, and if there be any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.",

    "Romans 13:12": "The night is far spent, and the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.",
    "Romans 13:13": "Let us walk becomingly, as in the day; not in revelling and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and jealousy.",
    "Romans 13:14": "But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.",

    "Romans 14:12": "So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God.",
    "Romans 14:13": "Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge ye this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock in his brother’s way, or an occasion of falling.",
    "Romans 14:14": "I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself: save that to him who accounteth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.",

    "Romans 14:16": "Let not then your good be evil spoken of:",
    "Romans 14:17": "for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.",
    "Romans 14:18": "For he that herein serveth Christ is well-pleasing to God, and approved of men.",
    "Romans 14:19": "So then let us follow after things which make for peace, and things whereby we may edify one another.",
    "Romans 14:20": "Overthrow not for meat’s sake the work of God. All things indeed are clean; howbeit it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.",
    "Romans 14:21": "It is good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to do anything whereby thy brother stumbleth.",
    "Romans 14:22": "The faith which thou hast, have thou to thyself before God. Happy is he that judgeth not himself in that which he approveth.",
    "Romans 14:23": "But he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith; and whatsoever is not of faith is sin.",
    "Romans 15:1": "Now we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.",
    "Romans 15:2": "Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good, unto edifying.",
    "Romans 15:3": "For Christ also pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me.",
    "Romans 15:4": "For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that through patience and through comfort of the scriptures we might have hope.",
    "Romans 15:5": "Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus:",
    "Romans 15:6": "that with one accord ye may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "Romans 15:7": "Wherefore receive ye one another, even as Christ also received you, to the glory of God.",
    "Romans 15:8": "For I say that Christ hath been made a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises given unto the fathers,",
    "Romans 15:9": "and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, Therefore will I give praise unto thee among the Gentiles, And sing unto thy name.",
    "Romans 15:10": "And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.",
    "Romans 15:11": "And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; And let all the peoples praise him.",
    "Romans 15:12": "And again, Isaiah saith, There shall be the root of Jesse, And he that ariseth to rule over the Gentiles; On him shall the Gentiles hope.",
    "Romans 15:13": "Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Spirit.",
    "Romans 15:14": "And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.",
    "Romans 15:15": "But I write the more boldly unto you in some measure, as putting you again in remembrance, because of the grace that was given me of God,",
    "Romans 15:16": "that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus unto the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.",
    "Romans 15:17": "I have therefore my glorying in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God.",
    "Romans 15:18": "For I will not dare to speak of any things save those which Christ wrought through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,",
    "Romans 15:19": "in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and round about even unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ;",
    "Romans 15:20": "yea, making it my aim so to preach the gospel, not where Christ was already named, that I might not build upon another man’s foundation;",
    "Romans 15:21": "but, as it is written, They shall see, to whom no tidings of him came, And they who have not heard shall understand.",
    "Romans 15:22": "Wherefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you:",
    "Romans 15:23": "but now, having no more any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come unto you,",
    "Romans 15:24": "whensoever I go unto Spain (for I hope to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first in some measure I shall have been satisfied with your company)—",
    "Romans 15:25": "but now, I say, I go unto Jerusalem, ministering unto the saints.",
    "Romans 15:26": "For it hath been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints that are at Jerusalem.",
    "Romans 15:27": "Yea, it hath been their good pleasure; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it to them also to minister unto them in carnal things.",
    "Romans 15:28": "When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by you unto Spain.",
    "Romans 15:29": "And I know that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ.",
    "Romans 15:30": "Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;",

    "Romans 15:32": "that I may come unto you in joy through the will of God, and together with you find rest.",
    "Romans 15:33": "Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.",
    "Romans 16:1": "I commend unto you Phoebe our sister, who is a servant of the church that is at Cenchreae:",
    "Romans 16:2": "that ye receive her in the Lord, worthily of the saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever matter she may have need of you: for she herself also hath been a helper of many, and of mine own self.",
    "Romans 16:3": "Salute Prisca and Aquila my fellow-workers in Christ Jesus,",
    "Romans 16:4": "who for my life laid down their own necks; unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles:",
    "Romans 16:5": "and salute the church that is in their house. Salute Epænetus my beloved, who is the first-fruits of Asia unto Christ.",

    "Romans 16:16": "Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ salute you.",
    "Romans 16:17": "Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them that are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling, contrary to the doctrine which ye learned: and turn away from them.",
    "Romans 16:18": "For they that are such serve not our Lord Christ, but their own belly; and by their smooth and fair speech they beguile the hearts of the innocent.",

    "1 Corinthians 1:20": "Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?",

    "1 Corinthians 2:13": "Which things also we speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Spirit teacheth; combining spiritual things with spiritual words.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:14": "Now the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him; and he cannot know them, because they are spiritually judged.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:15": "But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, and he himself is judged of no man.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:16": "For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:1": "And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:2": "I fed you with milk, not with meat; for ye were not yet able to bear it: nay, not even now are ye able;",
    "1 Corinthians 3:3": "for ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you jealousy and strife, are ye not carnal, and do ye not walk after the manner of men?",
    "1 Corinthians 3:4": "For when one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not men?",
    "1 Corinthians 3:5": "What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? Ministers through whom ye believed; and each as the Lord gave to him.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:6": "I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:7": "So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:8": "Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.",

    "1 Corinthians 3:10": "According to the grace of God which was given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon.",

    "1 Corinthians 3:15": "If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:16": "Know ye not that ye are a temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?",
    "1 Corinthians 3:17": "If any man destroyeth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:18": "Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinketh that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:19": "For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He that taketh the wise in their craftiness:",
    "1 Corinthians 3:20": "and again, The Lord knoweth the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:21": "Wherefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours;",
    "1 Corinthians 3:22": "whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;",
    "1 Corinthians 3:23": "and ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.",

    "1 Corinthians 4:2": "Here, moreover, it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:3": "But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:4": "For I know nothing against myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:5": "Wherefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall each man have his praise from God.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:6": "Now these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes; that in us ye might learn not to go beyond the things which are written; that no one of you be puffed up for the one against the other.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:7": "For who maketh thee to differ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? but if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?",
    "1 Corinthians 4:8": "Already are ye filled, already ye are become rich, ye have come to reign without us: yea and I would that ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:9": "For, I think, God hath set forth us the apostles last of all, as men doomed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, both to angels and men.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:10": "We are fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye have glory, but we have dishonor.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:11": "Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling-place;",
    "1 Corinthians 4:12": "and we toil, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure;",
    "1 Corinthians 4:13": "being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things, even until now.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:14": "I write not these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:15": "For though ye have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I begat you through the gospel.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:16": "I beseech you therefore, be ye imitators of me.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:17": "For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in remembrance of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:18": "Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:19": "But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will; and I will know, not the word of them that are puffed up, but the power.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:20": "For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:21": "What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?",
    "1 Corinthians 5:1": "It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles, that one of you hath his father’s wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:2": "And ye are puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:3": "For I verily, being absent in body but present in spirit, have already as though I were present judged him that hath so wrought this thing,",
    "1 Corinthians 5:4": "in the name of our Lord Jesus, ye being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,",
    "1 Corinthians 5:5": "to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:6": "Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?",
    "1 Corinthians 5:7": "Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are unleavened. For our passover also hath been sacrificed, even Christ:",
    "1 Corinthians 5:8": "wherefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:9": "I wrote unto you in my epistle to have no company with fornicators;",
    "1 Corinthians 5:10": "not at all meaning with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world:",
    "1 Corinthians 5:11": "but as it is, I wrote unto you not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one no, not to eat.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:12": "For what have I to do with judging them that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within?",
    "1 Corinthians 5:13": "But them that are without God judgeth. Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:1": "Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:2": "Or know ye not that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world is judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:3": "Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more, things that pertain to this life?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:4": "If then ye have to judge things pertaining to this life, do ye set them to judge who are of no account in the church?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:5": "I say this to move you to shame. What, cannot there be found among you one wise man who shall be able to decide between his brethren,",
    "1 Corinthians 6:6": "but brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:7": "Nay, already it is altogether a defect in you, that ye have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather take wrong? why not rather be defrauded?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:8": "Nay, but ye yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:9": "Or know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men,",
    "1 Corinthians 6:10": "nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:11": "And such were some of you: but ye were washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:12": "All things are lawful for me; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me; but I will not be brought under the power of any.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:13": "Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall bring to nought both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body:",
    "1 Corinthians 6:14": "and God both raised the Lord, and will raise up us through his power.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:15": "Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ? shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? God forbid.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:16": "Or know ye not that he that is joined to a harlot is one body? for, The twain, saith he, shall become one flesh.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:17": "But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:18": "Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:19": "Or know ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have from God? and ye are not your own;",
    "1 Corinthians 6:20": "for ye were bought with a price: glorify God therefore in your body.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:1": "Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:2": "But, because of fornications, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:3": "Let the husband render unto the wife her due: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:4": "The wife hath not power over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power over his own body, but the wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:5": "Defraud ye not one the other, except it be by consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves unto prayer, and may be together again, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:6": "But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:7": "Yet I would that all men were even as I myself. Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:8": "But I say to the unmarried and to widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:9": "But if they have not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:10": "But unto the married I give charge, yea not I, but the Lord, That the wife depart not from her husband",
    "1 Corinthians 7:11": "(but should she depart, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband); and that the husband leave not his wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:12": "But to the rest say I, not the Lord: If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she is content to dwell with him, let him not leave her.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:13": "And the woman that hath an unbelieving husband, and he is content to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:14": "For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:15": "Yet if the unbelieving departeth, let him depart: the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us in peace.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:16": "For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O husband, whether thou shalt save thy wife?",
    "1 Corinthians 7:17": "Only, as the Lord hath distributed to each man, as God hath called each, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all the churches.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:18": "Was any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Hath any been called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:19": "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:20": "Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:21": "Wast thou called being a bondservant? care not for it: nay, even if thou canst become free, use it rather.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:22": "For he that was called in the Lord being a bondservant, is the Lord’s freedman: likewise he that was called being free, is Christ’s bondservant.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:23": "Ye were bought with a price; become not bondservants of men.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:24": "Brethren, let each man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:25": "Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be trustworthy.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:26": "I think therefore that this is good by reason of the distress that is upon us, namely, that it is good for a man to be as he is.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:27": "Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:28": "But shouldest thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Yet such shall have tribulation in the flesh: and I would spare you.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:29": "But this I say, brethren, the time is shortened, that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none;",
    "1 Corinthians 7:30": "and those that weep, as though they wept not; and those that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those that buy, as though they possessed not;",
    "1 Corinthians 7:31": "and those that use the world, as not using it to the full: for the fashion of this world passeth away.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:32": "But I would have you to be free from cares. He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord:",
    "1 Corinthians 7:33": "but he that is married is careful for the things of the world, how he may please his wife,",
    "1 Corinthians 7:34": "and is divided. So also the woman that is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:35": "And this I say for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:36": "But if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin daughter, if she be past the flower of her age, and if need so requireth, let him do what he will; he sinneth not; let them marry.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:37": "But he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power as touching his own will, and hath determined this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin daughter, shall do well.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:38": "So then both he that giveth his own virgin daughter in marriage doeth well; and he that giveth her not in marriage shall do better.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:39": "A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:40": "But she is happier if she abide as she is, after my judgment: and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:1": "Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:2": "If any man thinketh that he knoweth anything, he knoweth not yet as he ought to know;",
    "1 Corinthians 8:3": "but if any man loveth God, the same is known by him.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:4": "Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no God but one.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:5": "For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth; as there are gods many, and lords many;",
    "1 Corinthians 8:6": "yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:7": "Howbeit there is not in all men that knowledge: but some, being used until now to the idol, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:8": "But food will not commend us to God: neither, if we eat not, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:9": "But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to the weak.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:10": "For if a man see thee who hast knowledge sitting at meat in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?",
    "1 Corinthians 8:11": "For through thy knowledge he that is weak perisheth, the brother for whose sake Christ died.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:12": "And thus, sinning against the brethren, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, ye sin against Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:13": "Wherefore, if meat causeth my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh for evermore, that I cause not my brother to stumble.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:1": "Am I not free? am I not an apostle? have I not seen Jesus our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:2": "If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:3": "My defence to them that examine me is this.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:4": "Have we no right to eat and to drink?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:5": "Have we no right to lead about a wife that is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:6": "Or I only and Barnabas, have we not a right to forbear working?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:7": "What soldier ever serveth at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:8": "Do I speak these things after the manner of men? or saith not the law also the same?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:9": "For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. Is it for the oxen that God careth,",
    "1 Corinthians 9:10": "or saith he it assuredly for our sake? Yea, for our sake it was written: because he that ploweth ought to plow in hope, and he that thresheth, to thresh in hope of partaking.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:11": "If we sowed unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal things?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:12": "If others partake of this right over you, do not we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right; but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:13": "Know ye not that they that minister about sacred things eat of the things of the temple, and they that wait upon the altar have their portion with the altar?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:14": "Even so did the Lord ordain that they that proclaim the gospel should live of the gospel.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:15": "But I have used none of these things: and I write not these things that it may be so done in my case; for it were good for me rather to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:16": "For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for necessity is laid upon me; for woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:17": "For if I do this of mine own will, I have a reward: but if not of mine own will, I have a stewardship intrusted to me.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:18": "What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:19": "For though I was free from all men, I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:20": "And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, not being myself under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;",
    "1 Corinthians 9:21": "to them that are without law, as without law, not being without law to God, but under law to Christ, that I might gain them that are without law.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:22": "To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I am become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:23": "And I do all things for the gospel’s sake, that I may be a joint partaker thereof.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:24": "Know ye not that they that run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? Even so run; that ye may attain.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:25": "And every man that striveth in the games exerciseth self-control in all things. Now they do it to receive a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:26": "I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so fight I, as not beating the air:",
    "1 Corinthians 9:27": "but I buffet my body, and bring it into bondage: lest by any means, after that I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:1": "For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;",
    "1 Corinthians 10:2": "and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;",
    "1 Corinthians 10:3": "and did all eat the same spiritual food;",
    "1 Corinthians 10:4": "and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock was Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:5": "Howbeit with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:6": "Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:7": "Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:8": "Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:9": "Neither let us make trial of the Lord, as some of them made trial, and perished by the serpents.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:10": "Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:11": "Now these things happened unto them by way of example; and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:12": "Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:13": "There hath no temptation taken you but such as man can bear: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:14": "Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:15": "I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:16": "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a communion of the body of Christ?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:17": "seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one body: for we are all partake of the one bread.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:18": "Behold Israel after the flesh: have not they that eat the sacrifices communion with the altar?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:19": "What say I then? that a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:20": "But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have communion with demons.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:21": "Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: ye cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:22": "Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:23": "All things are lawful; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful; but not all things edify.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:24": "Let no man seek his own, but each his neighbor’s good.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:25": "Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat, asking no question for conscience’ sake;",
    "1 Corinthians 10:26": "for the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:27": "If one of them that believe not biddeth you to a feast, and ye are disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience’ sake.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:28": "But if any man say unto you, This hath been offered in sacrifice, eat not, for his sake that showed it, and for conscience’ sake:",
    "1 Corinthians 10:29": "conscience, I say, not thine own, but the other’s; for why is my liberty judged by another conscience?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:30": "If I partake with thankfulness, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:31": "Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:32": "Give no occasion of stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God:",
    "1 Corinthians 10:33": "even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of the many, that they may be saved.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:1": "Be ye imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:2": "Now I praise you that ye remember me in all things, and hold fast the traditions, even as I delivered them to you.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:3": "But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:4": "Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoreth his head.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:5": "But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoreth her head; for it is one and the same thing as if she were shaven.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:6": "For if a woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn: but if it is a shame to a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:7": "For a man indeed ought not to have his head veiled, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:8": "For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man:",
    "1 Corinthians 11:9": "for neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man:",
    "1 Corinthians 11:10": "for this cause ought the woman to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:11": "Nevertheless, neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:12": "For as the woman is of the man, so is the man also by the woman; but all things are of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:13": "Judge ye in yourselves: is it seemly that a woman pray unto God unveiled?",
    "1 Corinthians 11:14": "Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a dishonor to him?",
    "1 Corinthians 11:15": "But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:16": "But if any man seemeth to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:17": "But in giving you this charge, I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better but for the worse.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:18": "For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and I partly believe it.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:19": "For there must be also factions among you, that they that are approved may be made manifest among you.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:20": "When therefore ye assemble yourselves together, it is not possible to eat the Lord’s supper:",
    "1 Corinthians 11:21": "for in your eating each one taketh before other his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:22": "What, have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this I praise you not.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:23": "For I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread;",
    "1 Corinthians 11:24": "and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:25": "In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:26": "For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord’s death till he come.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:27": "Wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:28": "But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:29": "For he that eateth and drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself, if he discern not the body.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:30": "For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:31": "But if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:32": "But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:33": "Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait one for another.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:34": "If any man is hungry, let him eat at home; that your coming together be not unto judgment. And the rest will I set in order whensoever I come.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:1": "Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:2": "Ye know that when ye were Gentiles ye were led away unto those dumb idols, howsoever ye might be led.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:3": "Wherefore I make known unto you, that no man speaking in the Spirit of God saith, Jesus is anathema; and no man can say, Jesus is Lord, but in the Holy Spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:4": "Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:5": "And there are diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:6": "And there are diversities of workings, but the same God, who worketh all things in all.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:7": "But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:8": "For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit:",
    "1 Corinthians 12:9": "to another faith, in the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, in the one Spirit;",
    "1 Corinthians 12:10": "and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits: to another divers kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues:",
    "1 Corinthians 12:11": "but all these worketh the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as he will.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:12": "For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:13": "For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:14": "For the body is not one member, but many.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:15": "If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:16": "And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:17": "If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?",
    "1 Corinthians 12:18": "But now hath God set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased him.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:19": "And if they were all one member, where were the body?",
    "1 Corinthians 12:20": "But now they are many members, but one body.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:21": "And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:22": "Nay, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary:",
    "1 Corinthians 12:23": "and those parts of the body, which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness;",
    "1 Corinthians 12:24": "whereas our comely parts have no need: but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to that part which lacked;",
    "1 Corinthians 12:25": "that there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:26": "And whether one member suffereth, all the members suffer with it; or one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:27": "Now ye are the body of Christ, and severally members thereof.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:28": "And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, divers kinds of tongues.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:29": "Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?",
    "1 Corinthians 12:30": "have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?",
    "1 Corinthians 12:31": "But desire earnestly the greater gifts. And moreover a most excellent way show I unto you.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:1": "If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:2": "And if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:3": "And if I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profiteth me nothing.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:4": "Love suffereth long, and is kind; love envieth not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,",
    "1 Corinthians 13:5": "doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not its own, is not provoked, taketh not account of evil;",
    "1 Corinthians 13:6": "rejoiceth not in unrighteousness, but rejoiceth with the truth;",
    "1 Corinthians 13:7": "beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:8": "Love never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall be done away; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall be done away.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:9": "For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;",
    "1 Corinthians 13:10": "but when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:11": "When I was a child, I spake as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child: now that I am become a man, I have put away childish things.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:12": "For now we see in a mirror, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know fully even as also I was fully known.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:13": "But now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:1": "Follow after love; yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:2": "For he that speaketh in a tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God; for no man understandeth; but in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:3": "But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men edification, and exhortation, and consolation.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:4": "He that speaketh in a tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:5": "Now I would have you all speak with tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy: and greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:6": "But now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:7": "Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they give not a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:8": "For if the trumpet give an uncertain voice, who shall prepare himself for war?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:9": "So also ye, unless ye utter by the tongue speech easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye will be speaking into the air.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:10": "There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and no kind is without signification.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:11": "If then I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh will be a barbarian unto me.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:12": "So also ye, since ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may abound unto the edifying of the church.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:13": "Wherefore let him that speaketh in a tongue pray that he may interpret.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:14": "For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:15": "What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:16": "Else if thou bless with the spirit, how shall he that filleth the place of the unlearned say the Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he knoweth not what thou sayest?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:17": "For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:18": "I thank God, I speak with tongues more than you all:",
    "1 Corinthians 14:19": "howbeit in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:20": "Brethren, be not children in mind: yet in malice be ye babes, but in mind be men.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:21": "In the law it is written, By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will I speak unto this people; and not even thus will they hear me, saith the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:22": "Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to the unbelieving: but prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to them that believe.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:23": "If therefore the whole church be assembled together and all speak with tongues, and there come in men unlearned or unbelieving, will they not say that ye are mad?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:24": "But if all prophesy, and there come in one unbelieving or unlearned, he is reproved by all, he is judged by all;",
    "1 Corinthians 14:25": "the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:26": "What is it then, brethren? When ye come together, each one hath a psalm, hath a teaching, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:27": "If any man speaketh in a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most three, and that in turn; and let one interpret:",
    "1 Corinthians 14:28": "but if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:29": "And let the prophets speak by two or three, and let the others discern.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:30": "But if a revelation be made to another sitting by, let the first keep silence.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:31": "For ye all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted;",
    "1 Corinthians 14:32": "and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets;",
    "1 Corinthians 14:33": "for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace.As in all the churches of the saints,",
    "1 Corinthians 14:34": "let the women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as also saith the law.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:35": "And if they would learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home: for it is shameful for a woman to speak in the church.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:36": "What? was it from you that the word of God went forth? or came it unto you alone?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:37": "If any man thinketh himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him take knowledge of the things which I write unto you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:38": "But if any man is ignorant, let him be ignorant.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:39": "Wherefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:40": "But let all things be done decently and in order.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:1": "Now I make known unto you brethren, the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye received, wherein also ye stand,",
    "1 Corinthians 15:2": "by which also ye are saved, if ye hold fast the word which I preached unto you, except ye believed in vain.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:3": "For I delivered unto you first of all that which also I received: that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;",
    "1 Corinthians 15:4": "and that he was buried; and that he hath been raised on the third day according to the scriptures;",
    "1 Corinthians 15:5": "and that he appeared to Cephas; then to the twelve;",
    "1 Corinthians 15:6": "then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain until now, but some are fallen asleep;",
    "1 Corinthians 15:7": "then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles;",
    "1 Corinthians 15:8": "and last of all, as to the child untimely born, he appeared to me also.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:9": "For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:10": "But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not found vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:11": "Whether then it be I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:12": "Now if Christ is preached that he hath been raised from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?",
    "1 Corinthians 15:13": "But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither hath Christ been raised:",
    "1 Corinthians 15:14": "and if Christ hath not been raised, then is our preaching vain, your faith also is vain.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:15": "Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we witnessed of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead are not raised.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:16": "For if the dead are not raised, neither hath Christ been raised:",
    "1 Corinthians 15:17": "and if Christ hath not been raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:18": "Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ have perished.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:19": "If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:20": "But now hath Christ been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of them that are asleep.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:21": "For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:22": "For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:23": "But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; then they that are Christ’s, at his coming.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:24": "Then cometh the end, when he shall deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have abolished all rule and all authority and power.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:25": "For he must reign, till he hath put all his enemies under his feet.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:26": "The last enemy that shall be abolished is death.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:27": "For, He put all things in subjection under his feet. But when he saith, All things are put in subjection, it is evident that he is excepted who did subject all things unto him.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:28": "And when all things have been subjected unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subjected to him that did subject all things unto him, that God may be all in all.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:29": "Else what shall they do that are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them?",
    "1 Corinthians 15:30": "why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?",
    "1 Corinthians 15:31": "I protest by that glorying in you, brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:32": "If after the manner of men I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:33": "Be not deceived: Evil companionships corrupt good morals.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:34": "Awake to soberness righteously, and sin not; for some have no knowledge of God: I speak this to move you to shame.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:35": "But some one will say, How are the dead raised? and with what manner of body do they come?",
    "1 Corinthians 15:36": "Thou foolish one, that which thou thyself sowest is not quickened except it die:",
    "1 Corinthians 15:37": "and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other kind;",
    "1 Corinthians 15:38": "but God giveth it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:39": "All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fishes.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:40": "There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:41": "There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differeth from another star in glory.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:42": "So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:",
    "1 Corinthians 15:43": "it is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:",
    "1 Corinthians 15:44": "it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:45": "So also it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul. The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:46": "Howbeit that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; then that which is spiritual.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:47": "The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is of heaven.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:48": "As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:49": "And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:50": "Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:51": "Behold, I tell you a mystery: We all shall not sleep, but we shall all be changed,",
    "1 Corinthians 15:52": "in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:53": "For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:54": "But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:55": "O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?",
    "1 Corinthians 15:56": "The sting of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law:",
    "1 Corinthians 15:57": "but thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:58": "Wherefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not vain in the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:1": "Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I gave order to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:2": "Upon the first day of the week let each one of you lay by him in store, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:3": "And when I arrive, whomsoever ye shall approve, them will I send with letters to carry your bounty unto Jerusalem:",
    "1 Corinthians 16:4": "and if it be meet for me to go also, they shall go with me.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:5": "But I will come unto you, when I shall have passed through Macedonia; for I pass through Macedonia;",
    "1 Corinthians 16:6": "but with you it may be that I shall abide, or even winter, that ye may set me forward on my journey whithersoever I go.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:7": "For I do not wish to see you now by the way; for I hope to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:8": "But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost;",
    "1 Corinthians 16:9": "for a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:10": "Now if Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear; for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do:",
    "1 Corinthians 16:11": "let no man therefore despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come unto me: for I expect him with the brethren.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:12": "But as touching Apollos the brother, I besought him much to come unto you with the brethren: and it was not at all his will to come now; but he will come when he shall have opportunity.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:13": "Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:14": "Let all that ye do be done in love.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:15": "Now I beseech you, brethren (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to minister unto the saints),",
    "1 Corinthians 16:16": "that ye also be in subjection unto such, and to every one that helpeth in the work and laboreth.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:17": "And I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they supplied.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:18": "For they refreshed my spirit and yours: acknowledge ye therefore them that are such.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:19": "The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Prisca salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:20": "All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:21": "The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:22": "If any man loveth not the Lord, let him be anathema. Maranatha.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:23": "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:24": "My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:1": "Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints that are in the whole of Achaia:",
    "2 Corinthians 1:2": "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:3": "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort;",
    "2 Corinthians 1:4": "who comforteth us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort them that are in any affliction, through the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:5": "For as the sufferings of Christ abound unto us, even so our comfort also aboundeth through Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:6": "But whether we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which worketh in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer:",
    "2 Corinthians 1:7": "and our hope for you is stedfast; knowing that, as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also are ye of the comfort.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:8": "For we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning our affliction which befell us in Asia, that we were weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, insomuch that we despaired even of life:",
    "2 Corinthians 1:9": "yea, we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead:",
    "2 Corinthians 1:10": "who delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver: on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us;",
    "2 Corinthians 1:11": "ye also helping together on our behalf by your supplication; that, for the gift bestowed upon us by means of many, thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:12": "For our glorying is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:13": "For we write no other things unto you, than what ye read or even acknowledge, and I hope ye will acknowledge unto the end:",
    "2 Corinthians 1:14": "as also ye did acknowledge us in part, that we are your glorying, even as ye also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:15": "And in this confidence I was minded to come first unto you, that ye might have a second benefit;",
    "2 Corinthians 1:16": "and by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come unto you, and of you to be set forward on my journey unto Judæa.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:17": "When I therefore was thus minded, did I show fickleness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be the yea yea and the nay nay?",
    "2 Corinthians 1:18": "But as God is faithful, our word toward you is not yea and nay.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:19": "For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timothy, was not yea and nay, but in him is yea.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:20": "For how many soever be the promises of God, in him is the yea: wherefore also through him is the Amen, unto the glory of God through us.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:21": "Now he that establisheth us with you in Christ, and anointed us, is God;",
    "2 Corinthians 1:22": "who also sealed us, and gave us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:23": "But I call God for a witness upon my soul, that to spare you I forbare to come unto Corinth.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:24": "Not that we have lordship over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for in faith ye stand fast.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:1": "But I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you with sorrow.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:2": "For if I make you sorry, who then is he that maketh me glad but he that is made sorry by me?",
    "2 Corinthians 2:3": "And I wrote this very thing, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:4": "For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be made sorry, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:5": "But if any hath caused sorrow, he hath caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I press not too heavily) to you all.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:6": "Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many;",
    "2 Corinthians 2:7": "so that contrariwise ye should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his overmuch sorrow.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:8": "Wherefore I beseech you to confirm your love toward him.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:9": "For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:10": "But to whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also: for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes have I forgiven it in the presence of Christ;",
    "2 Corinthians 2:11": "that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:12": "Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and when a door was opened unto me in the Lord,",
    "2 Corinthians 2:13": "I had no relief for my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:14": "But thanks be unto God, who always leadeth us in triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest through us the savor of his knowledge in every place.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:15": "For we are a sweet savor of Christ unto God, in them that are saved, and in them that perish;",
    "2 Corinthians 2:16": "to the one a savor from death unto death; to the other a savor from life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?",
    "2 Corinthians 2:17": "For we are not as the many, corrupting the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, speak we in Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:1": "Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? or need we, as do some, epistles of commendation to you or from you?",
    "2 Corinthians 3:2": "Ye are our epistle, written in our hearts, known and read of all men;",
    "2 Corinthians 3:3": "being made manifest that ye are an epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in tables that are hearts of flesh.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:4": "And such confidence have we through Christ to God-ward:",
    "2 Corinthians 3:5": "not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God;",
    "2 Corinthians 3:6": "who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:7": "But if the ministration of death, written, and engraven on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look stedfastly upon the face of Moses for the glory of his face; which glory was passing away:",
    "2 Corinthians 3:8": "how shall not rather the ministration of the spirit be with glory?",
    "2 Corinthians 3:9": "For if the ministration of condemnation hath glory, much rather doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:10": "For verily that which hath been made glorious hath not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasseth.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:11": "For if that which passeth away was with glory, much more that which remaineth is in glory.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:12": "Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech,",
    "2 Corinthians 3:13": "and are not as Moses, who put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel should not look stedfastly on the end of that which was passing away:",
    "2 Corinthians 3:14": "but their minds were hardened: for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remaineth, it not being revealed to them that it is done away in Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:15": "But unto this day, whensoever Moses is read, a veil lieth upon their heart.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:16": "But whensoever it shall turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:17": "Now the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:18": "But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord the Spirit.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:1": "Therefore seeing we have this ministry, even as we obtained mercy, we faint not:",
    "2 Corinthians 4:2": "but we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:3": "And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in them that perish:",
    "2 Corinthians 4:4": "in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not dawn upon them.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:5": "For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:6": "Seeing it is God, that said, Light shall shine out of darkness, who shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:7": "But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God, and not from ourselves;",
    "2 Corinthians 4:8": "we are pressed on every side, yet not straitened; perplexed, yet not unto despair;",
    "2 Corinthians 4:9": "pursued, yet not forsaken; smitten down, yet not destroyed;",
    "2 Corinthians 4:10": "always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:11": "For we who live are always delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:12": "So then death worketh in us, but life in you.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:13": "But having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, and therefore did I speak; we also believe, and therefore also we speak;",
    "2 Corinthians 4:14": "knowing that he that raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also with Jesus, and shall present us with you.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:15": "For all things are for your sakes, that the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound unto the glory of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:16": "Wherefore we faint not; but though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:17": "For our light affliction, which is for the moment, worketh for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory;",
    "2 Corinthians 4:18": "while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:1": "For we know that if the earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:2": "For verily in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our habitation which is from heaven:",
    "2 Corinthians 5:3": "if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:4": "For indeed we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened; not for that we would be unclothed, but that we would be clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up of life.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:5": "Now he that wrought us for this very thing is God, who gave unto us the earnest of the Spirit.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:6": "Being therefore always of good courage, and knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord",
    "2 Corinthians 5:7": "(for we walk by faith, not by sight);",
    "2 Corinthians 5:8": "we are of good courage, I say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:9": "Wherefore also we make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well-pleasing unto him.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:10": "For we must all be made manifest before the judgment-seat of Christ; that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he hath done, whether it be good or bad.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:11": "Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest unto God; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:12": "We are not again commending ourselves unto you, but speak as giving you occasion of glorying on our behalf, that ye may have wherewith to answer them that glory in appearance, and not in heart.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:13": "For whether we are beside ourselves, it is unto God; or whether we are of sober mind, it is unto you.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:14": "For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that one died for all, therefore all died;",
    "2 Corinthians 5:15": "and he died for all, that they that live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto him who for their sakes died and rose again.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:16": "Wherefore we henceforth know no man after the flesh: even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know him so no more.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:17": "Wherefore if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature: the old things are passed away; behold, they are become new.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:18": "But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation;",
    "2 Corinthians 5:19": "to wit, that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not reckoning unto them their trespasses, and having committed unto us the word of reconciliation.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:20": "We are ambassadors therefore on behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us: we beseech you on behalf of Christ, be ye reconciled to God.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:21": "Him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf; that we might become the righteousness of God in him.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:1": "And working together with him we entreat also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain",
    "2 Corinthians 6:2": "(for he saith, At an acceptable time I hearkened unto thee, And in a day of salvation did I succor thee:behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation):",
    "2 Corinthians 6:3": "giving no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our ministration be not blamed;",
    "2 Corinthians 6:4": "but in everything commending ourselves, as ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,",
    "2 Corinthians 6:5": "in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;",
    "2 Corinthians 6:6": "in pureness, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned,",
    "2 Corinthians 6:7": "in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,",
    "2 Corinthians 6:8": "by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true;",
    "2 Corinthians 6:9": "as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;",
    "2 Corinthians 6:10": "as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:11": "Our mouth is open unto you, O Corinthians, our heart is enlarged.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:12": "Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own affections.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:13": "Now for a recompense in like kind (I speak as unto my children), be ye also enlarged.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:14": "Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers: for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? or what communion hath light with darkness?",
    "2 Corinthians 6:15": "And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what portion hath a believer with an unbeliever?",
    "2 Corinthians 6:16": "And what agreement hath a temple of God with idols? for we are a temple of the living God; even as God said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:17": "Wherefore Come ye out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, And touch no unclean thing; And I will receive you,",
    "2 Corinthians 6:18": "And will be to you a Father, And ye shall be to me sons and daughters,saith the Lord Almighty.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:1": "Having therefore these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:2": "Open your hearts to us: we wronged no man, we corrupted no man, we took advantage of no man.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:3": "I say it not to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die together and live together.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:4": "Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying on your behalf: I am filled with comfort, I overflow with joy in all our affliction.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:5": "For even when we were come into Macedonia our flesh had no relief, but we were afflicted on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:6": "Nevertheless he that comforteth the lowly, even God, comforted us by the coming of Titus;",
    "2 Corinthians 7:7": "and not by his coming only, but also by the comfort wherewith he was comforted in you, while he told us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced yet more.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:8": "For though I made you sorry with my epistle, I do not regret it: though I did regret it (for I see that that epistle made you sorry, though but for a season),",
    "2 Corinthians 7:9": "I now rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye were made sorry unto repentance; for ye were made sorry after a godly sort, that ye might suffer loss by us in nothing.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:10": "For godly sorrow worketh repentance unto salvation, a repentance which bringeth no regret: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:11": "For behold, this selfsame thing, that ye were made sorry after a godly sort, what earnest care it wrought in you, yea what clearing of yourselves, yea what indignation, yea what fear, yea what longing, yea what zeal, yea what avenging! In everything ye approved yourselves to be pure in the matter.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:12": "So although I wrote unto you, I wrote not for his cause that did the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered the wrong, but that your earnest care for us might be made manifest unto you in the sight of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:13": "Therefore we have been comforted: and in our comfort we joyed the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit hath been refreshed by you all.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:14": "For if in anything I have gloried to him on your behalf, I was not put to shame; but as we spake all things to you in truth, so our glorying also which I made before Titus was found to be truth.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:15": "And his affection is more abundantly toward you, while he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:16": "I rejoice that in everything I am of good courage concerning you.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:1": "Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God which hath been given in the churches of Macedonia;",
    "2 Corinthians 8:2": "how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:3": "For according to their power, I bear witness, yea and beyond their power, they gave of their own accord,",
    "2 Corinthians 8:4": "beseeching us with much entreaty in regard of this grace and the fellowship in the ministering to the saints:",
    "2 Corinthians 8:5": "and this, not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:6": "Insomuch that we exhorted Titus, that as he had made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace also.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:7": "But as ye abound in everything, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all earnestness, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:8": "I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:9": "For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might become rich.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:10": "And herein I give my judgment: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to make a beginning a year ago, not only to do, but also to will.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:11": "But now complete the doing also; that as there was the readiness to will, so there may be the completion also out of your ability.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:12": "For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according as a man hath, not according as he hath not.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:13": "For I say not this that others may be eased and ye distressed;",
    "2 Corinthians 8:14": "but by equality: your abundance being a supply at this present time for their want, that their abundance also may become a supply for your want; that there may be equality:",
    "2 Corinthians 8:15": "as it is written, He that gathered much had nothing over; and he that gathered little had no lack.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:16": "But thanks be to God, who putteth the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:17": "For he accepted indeed our exhortation; but being himself very earnest, he went forth unto you of his own accord.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:18": "And we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel is spread through all the churches;",
    "2 Corinthians 8:19": "and not only so, but who was also appointed by the churches to travel with us in the matter of this grace, which is ministered by us to the glory of the Lord, and to show our readiness:",
    "2 Corinthians 8:20": "avoiding this, that any man should blame us in the matter of this bounty which is ministered by us:",
    "2 Corinthians 8:21": "for we take thought for things honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:22": "And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which he hath in you.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:23": "Whether any inquire about Titus, he is my partner and my fellow-worker to you-ward; or our brethren, they are the messengers of the churches, they are the glory of Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:24": "Show ye therefore unto them in the face of the churches the proof of your love, and of our glorying on your behalf.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:1": "For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:",
    "2 Corinthians 9:2": "for I know your readiness, of which I glory on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia hath been prepared for a year past; and your zeal hath stirred up very many of them.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:3": "But I have sent the brethren, that our glorying on your behalf may not be made void in this respect; that, even as I said, ye may be prepared:",
    "2 Corinthians 9:4": "lest by any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be put to shame in this confidence.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:5": "I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your aforepromised bounty, that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty, and not of extortion.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:6": "But this I say, He that soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:7": "Let each man do according as he hath purposed in his heart: not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:8": "And God is able to make all grace abound unto you; that ye, having always all sufficiency in everything, may abound unto every good work:",
    "2 Corinthians 9:9": "as it is written, He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the poor; His righteousness abideth for ever.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:10": "And he that supplieth seed to the sower and bread for food, shall supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness:",
    "2 Corinthians 9:11": "ye being enriched in everything unto all liberality, which worketh through us thanksgiving to God.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:12": "For the ministration of this service not only filleth up the measure of the wants of the saints, but aboundeth also through many thanksgivings unto God;",
    "2 Corinthians 9:13": "seeing that through the proving of you by this ministration they glorify God for the obedience of your confession unto the gospel of Christ, and for the liberality of your contribution unto them and unto all;",
    "2 Corinthians 9:14": "while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, long after you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:15": "Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:1": "Now I Paul myself entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I who in your presence am lowly among you, but being absent am of good courage toward you:",
    "2 Corinthians 10:2": "yea, I beseech you, that I may not when present show courage with the confidence wherewith I count to be bold against some, who count of us as if we walked according to the flesh.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:3": "For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh",
    "2 Corinthians 10:4": "(for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty before God to the casting down of strongholds),",
    "2 Corinthians 10:5": "casting down imaginations, and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ;",
    "2 Corinthians 10:6": "and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be made full.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:7": "Ye look at the things that are before your face. If any man trusteth in himself that he is Christ’s, let him consider this again with himself, that, even as he is Christ’s, so also are we.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:8": "For though I should glory somewhat abundantly concerning our authority (which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for casting you down), I shall not be put to shame:",
    "2 Corinthians 10:9": "that I may not seem as if I would terrify you by my letters.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:10": "For, His letters, they say, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:11": "Let such a one reckon this, that, what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such are we also in deed when we are present.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:12": "For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with certain of them that commend themselves: but they themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:13": "But we will not glory beyond our measure, but according to the measure of the province which God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even unto you.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:14": "For we stretch not ourselves overmuch, as though we reached not unto you: for we came even as far as unto you in the gospel of Christ:",
    "2 Corinthians 10:15": "not glorying beyond our measure, that is, in other men’s labors; but having hope that, as your faith groweth, we shall be magnified in you according to our province unto further abundance,",
    "2 Corinthians 10:16": "so as to preach the gospel even unto the parts beyond you, and not to glory in another’s province in regard of things ready to our hand.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:17": "But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:18": "For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:1": "Would that ye could bear with me in a little foolishness: but indeed ye do bear with me.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:2": "For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy: for I espoused you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:3": "But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and the purity that is toward Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:4": "For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or if ye receive a different spirit, which ye did not receive, or a different gospel, which ye did not accept, ye do well to bear with him.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:5": "For I reckon that I am not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:6": "But though I be rude in speech, yet am I not in knowledge; nay, in every way have we made this manifest unto you in all things.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:7": "Or did I commit a sin in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I preached to you the gospel of God for nought?",
    "2 Corinthians 11:8": "I robbed other churches, taking wages of them that I might minister unto you;",
    "2 Corinthians 11:9": "and when I was present with you and was in want, I was not a burden on any man; for the brethren, when they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my want; and in everything I kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:10": "As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this glorying in the regions of Achaia.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:11": "Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:12": "But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:13": "For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, fashioning themselves into apostles of Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:14": "And no marvel; for even Satan fashioneth himself into an angel of light.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:15": "It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also fashion themselves as ministers of righteousness, whose end shall be according to their works.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:16": "I say again, Let no man think me foolish; but if ye do, yet as foolish receive me, that I also may glory a little.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:17": "That which I speak, I speak not after the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of glorying.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:18": "Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:19": "For ye bear with the foolish gladly, being wise yourselves.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:20": "For ye bear with a man, if he bringeth you into bondage, if he devoureth you, if he taketh you captive, if he exalteth himself, if he smiteth you on the face.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:21": "I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet whereinsoever any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:22": "Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:23": "Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as one beside himself) I more; in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths oft.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:24": "Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:25": "Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day have I been in the deep;",
    "2 Corinthians 11:26": "in journeyings often, in perils of rivers, in perils of robbers, in perils from my countrymen, in perils from the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;",
    "2 Corinthians 11:27": "in labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:28": "Besides those things that are without, there is that which presseth upon me daily, anxiety for all the churches.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:29": "Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is caused to stumble, and I burn not?",
    "2 Corinthians 11:30": "If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things that concern my weakness.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:31": "The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed for evermore knoweth that I lie not.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:32": "In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes in order to take me:",
    "2 Corinthians 11:33": "and through a window was I let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:1": "I must needs glory, though it is not expedient; but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:2": "I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not; or whether out of the body, I know not; God knoweth), such a one caught up even to the third heaven.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:3": "And I know such a man (whether in the body, or apart from the body, I know not; God knoweth),",
    "2 Corinthians 12:4": "how that he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:5": "On behalf of such a one will I glory: but on mine own behalf I will not glory, save in my weaknesses.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:6": "For if I should desire to glory, I shall not be foolish; for I shall speak the truth: but I forbear, lest any man should account of me above that which he seeth me to be, or heareth from me.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:7": "And by reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted overmuch, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, that I should not be exalted overmuch.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:8": "Concerning this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:9": "And he hath said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my power is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:10": "Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:11": "I am become foolish: ye compelled me; for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I am nothing.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:12": "Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, by signs and wonders and mighty works.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:13": "For what is there wherein ye were made inferior to the rest of the churches, except it be that I myself was not a burden to you? forgive me this wrong.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:14": "Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be a burden to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:15": "And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?",
    "2 Corinthians 12:16": "But be it so, I did not myself burden you; but, being crafty, I caught you with guile.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:17": "Did I take advantage of you by any one of them whom I have sent unto you?",
    "2 Corinthians 12:18": "I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?",
    "2 Corinthians 12:19": "Ye think all this time that we are excusing ourselves unto you. In the sight of God speak we in Christ. But all things, beloved, are for your edifying.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:20": "For I fear, lest by any means, when I come, I should find you not such as I would, and should myself be found of you such as ye would not; lest by any means there should be strife, jealousy, wraths, factions, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults;",
    "2 Corinthians 12:21": "lest again when I come my God should humble me before you, and I should mourn for many of them that have sinned heretofore, and repented not of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they committed.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:1": "This is the third time I am coming to you. At the mouth of two witnesses or three shall every word be established.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:2": "I have said beforehand, and I do say beforehand, as when I was present the second time, so now, being absent, to them that have sinned heretofore, and to all the rest, that, if I come again, I will not spare;",
    "2 Corinthians 13:3": "seeing that ye seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me; who to you-ward is not weak, but is powerful in you:",
    "2 Corinthians 13:4": "for he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth through the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him through the power of God toward you.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:5": "Try your own selves, whether ye are in the faith; prove your own selves. Or know ye not as to your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you? unless indeed ye be reprobate.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:6": "But I hope that ye shall know that we are not reprobate.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:7": "Now we pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we may appear approved, but that ye may do that which is honorable, though we be as reprobate.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:8": "For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:9": "For we rejoice, when we are weak, and ye are strong: this we also pray for, even your perfecting.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:10": "For this cause I write these things while absent, that I may not when present deal sharply, according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for casting down.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:11": "Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfected; be comforted; be of the same mind; live in peace: and the God of love and peace shall be with you.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:12": "Salute one another with a holy kiss.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:13": "All the saints salute you.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:14": "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.",
    "Galatians 1:1": "Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead),",
    "Galatians 1:2": "and all the brethren that are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:",
    "Galatians 1:3": "Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,",
    "Galatians 1:4": "who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father:",
    "Galatians 1:5": "to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.",
    "Galatians 1:6": "I marvel that ye are so quickly removing from him that called you in the grace of Christ unto a different gospel;",
    "Galatians 1:7": "which is not another gospel: only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.",
    "Galatians 1:8": "But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach unto you any gospel other than that which we preached unto you, let him be anathema.",
    "Galatians 1:9": "As we have said before, so say I now again, If any man preacheth unto you any gospel other than that which ye received, let him be anathema.",
    "Galatians 1:10": "For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? or am I striving to please men? if I were still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ.",
    "Galatians 1:11": "For I make known to you, brethren, as touching the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not after man.",
    "Galatians 1:12": "For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.",
    "Galatians 1:13": "For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and made havoc of it:",
    "Galatians 1:14": "and I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.",
    "Galatians 1:15": "But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me, even from my mother’s womb, and called me through his grace,",
    "Galatians 1:16": "to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; straightway I conferred not with flesh and blood:",
    "Galatians 1:17": "neither went I up to Jerusalem to them that were apostles before me: but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned unto Damascus.",
    "Galatians 1:18": "Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days.",
    "Galatians 1:19": "But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother.",
    "Galatians 1:20": "Now touching the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.",
    "Galatians 1:21": "Then I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.",
    "Galatians 1:22": "And I was still unknown by face unto the churches of Judæa which were in Christ:",
    "Galatians 1:23": "but they only heard say, He that once persecuted us now preacheth the faith of which he once made havoc;",
    "Galatians 1:24": "and they glorified God in me.",
    "Galatians 2:1": "Then after the space of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.",
    "Galatians 2:2": "And I went up by revelation; and I laid before them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles but privately before them who were of repute, lest by any means I should be running, or had run, in vain.",
    "Galatians 2:3": "But not even Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:",
    "Galatians 2:4": "and that because of the false brethren privily brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:",
    "Galatians 2:5": "to whom we gave place in the way of subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.",
    "Galatians 2:6": "But from those who were reputed to be somewhat (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth not man’s person)—they, I say, who were of repute imparted nothing to me:",
    "Galatians 2:7": "but contrariwise, when they saw that I had been intrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, even as Peter with the gospel of the circumcision",
    "Galatians 2:8": "(for he that wrought for Peter unto the apostleship of the circumcision wrought for me also unto the Gentiles);",
    "Galatians 2:9": "and when they perceived the grace that was given unto me, James and Cephas and John, they who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision;",
    "Galatians 2:10": "only they would that we should remember the poor; which very thing I was also zealous to do.",
    "Galatians 2:11": "But when Cephas came to Antioch, I resisted him to the face, because he stood condemned.",
    "Galatians 2:12": "For before that certain came from James, he ate with the Gentiles; but when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing them that were of the circumcision.",
    "Galatians 2:13": "And the rest of the Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that even Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation.",
    "Galatians 2:14": "But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Cephas before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest as do the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, how compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?",
    "Galatians 2:15": "We being Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,",
    "Galatians 2:16": "yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed on Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.",
    "Galatians 2:17": "But if, while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a minister of sin? God forbid.",
    "Galatians 2:18": "For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove myself a transgressor.",
    "Galatians 2:19": "For I through the law died unto the law, that I might live unto God.",
    "Galatians 2:20": "I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I that live, but Christ liveth in me: and that life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith which is in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself up for me.",
    "Galatians 2:21": "I do not make void the grace of God: for if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nought.",
    "Galatians 3:1": "O foolish Galatians, who did bewitch you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth crucified?",
    "Galatians 3:2": "This only would I learn from you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?",
    "Galatians 3:3": "Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now perfected in the flesh?",
    "Galatians 3:4": "Did ye suffer so many things in vain? if it be indeed in vain.",
    "Galatians 3:5": "He therefore that supplieth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?",
    "Galatians 3:6": "Even as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.",
    "Galatians 3:7": "Know therefore that they that are of faith, the same are sons of Abraham.",
    "Galatians 3:8": "And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all the nations be blessed.",
    "Galatians 3:9": "So then they that are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.",
    "Galatians 3:10": "For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one who continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.",
    "Galatians 3:11": "Now that no man is justified by the law before God, is evident: for, The righteous shall live by faith;",
    "Galatians 3:12": "and the law is not of faith; but, He that doeth them shall live in them.",
    "Galatians 3:13": "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:",
    "Galatians 3:14": "that upon the Gentiles might come the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.",
    "Galatians 3:15": "Brethren, I speak after the manner of men: Though it be but a man’s covenant, yet when it hath been confirmed, no one maketh it void, or addeth thereto.",
    "Galatians 3:16": "Now to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.",
    "Galatians 3:17": "Now this I say: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of none effect.",
    "Galatians 3:18": "For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise: but God hath granted it to Abraham by promise.",
    "Galatians 3:19": "What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise hath been made; and it was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.",
    "Galatians 3:20": "Now a mediator is not a mediator of one; but God is one.",
    "Galatians 3:21": "Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could make alive, verily righteousness would have been of the law.",
    "Galatians 3:22": "But the scripture shut up all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.",
    "Galatians 3:23": "But before faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.",
    "Galatians 3:24": "So that the law is become our tutor to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.",
    "Galatians 3:25": "But now that faith is come, we are no longer under a tutor.",
    "Galatians 3:26": "For ye are all sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus.",
    "Galatians 3:27": "For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ.",
    "Galatians 3:28": "There can be neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female; for ye all are one man in Christ Jesus.",
    "Galatians 3:29": "And if ye are Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, heirs according to promise.",
    "Galatians 4:1": "But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a bondservant though he is lord of all;",
    "Galatians 4:2": "but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed of the father.",
    "Galatians 4:3": "So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the rudiments of the world:",
    "Galatians 4:4": "but when the fulness of the time came, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,",
    "Galatians 4:5": "that he might redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.",
    "Galatians 4:6": "And because ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father.",
    "Galatians 4:7": "So that thou art no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.",
    "Galatians 4:8": "Howbeit at that time, not knowing God, ye were in bondage to them that by nature are no gods:",
    "Galatians 4:9": "but now that ye have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how turn ye back again to the weak and beggarly rudiments, whereunto ye desire to be in bondage over again?",
    "Galatians 4:10": "Ye observe days, and months, and seasons, and years.",
    "Galatians 4:11": "I am afraid of you, lest by any means I have bestowed labor upon you in vain.",
    "Galatians 4:12": "I beseech you, brethren, become as I am, for I also am become as ye are. Ye did me no wrong:",
    "Galatians 4:13": "but ye know that because of an infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you the first time:",
    "Galatians 4:14": "and that which was a temptation to you in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but ye received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.",
    "Galatians 4:15": "Where then is that gratulation of yourselves? for I bear you witness, that, if possible, ye would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.",
    "Galatians 4:16": "So then am I become your enemy, by telling you the truth?",
    "Galatians 4:17": "They zealously seek you in no good way; nay, they desire to shut you out, that ye may seek them.",
    "Galatians 4:18": "But it is good to be zealously sought in a good matter at all times, and not only when I am present with you.",
    "Galatians 4:19": "My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you—",
    "Galatians 4:20": "but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone; for I am perplexed about you.",
    "Galatians 4:21": "Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?",
    "Galatians 4:22": "For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the freewoman.",
    "Galatians 4:23": "Howbeit the son by the handmaid is born after the flesh; but the son by the freewoman is born through promise.",
    "Galatians 4:24": "Which things contain an allegory: for these women are two covenants; one from mount Sinai, bearing children unto bondage, which is Hagar.",
    "Galatians 4:25": "Now this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia and answereth to the Jerusalem that now is: for she is in bondage with her children.",
    "Galatians 4:26": "But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is our mother.",
    "Galatians 4:27": "For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; Break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: For more are the children of the desolate than of her that hath the husband.",
    "Galatians 4:28": "Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise.",
    "Galatians 4:29": "But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, so also it is now.",
    "Galatians 4:30": "Howbeit what saith the scripture? Cast out the handmaid and her son: for the son of the handmaid shall not inherit with the son of the freewoman.",
    "Galatians 4:31": "Wherefore, brethren, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the freewoman.",
    "Galatians 5:1": "For freedom did Christ set us free: stand fast therefore, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage.",
    "Galatians 5:2": "Behold, I Paul say unto you, that, if ye receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.",
    "Galatians 5:3": "Yea, I testify again to every man that receiveth circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.",
    "Galatians 5:4": "Ye are severed from Christ, ye who would be justified by the law; ye are fallen away from grace.",
    "Galatians 5:5": "For we through the Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.",
    "Galatians 5:6": "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love.",
    "Galatians 5:7": "Ye were running well; who hindered you that ye should not obey the truth?",
    "Galatians 5:8": "This persuasion came not of him that calleth you.",
    "Galatians 5:9": "A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.",
    "Galatians 5:10": "I have confidence to you-ward in the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.",
    "Galatians 5:11": "But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? then hath the stumbling-block of the cross been done away.",
    "Galatians 5:12": "I would that they that unsettle you would even go beyond circumcision.",
    "Galatians 5:13": "For ye, brethren, were called for freedom; only use not your freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through love be servants one to another.",
    "Galatians 5:14": "For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.",
    "Galatians 5:15": "But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.",
    "Galatians 5:16": "But I say, Walk by the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.",
    "Galatians 5:17": "For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other; that ye may not do the things that ye would.",
    "Galatians 5:18": "But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.",
    "Galatians 5:19": "Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,",
    "Galatians 5:20": "idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousies, wraths, factions, divisions, parties,",
    "Galatians 5:21": "envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and such like; of which I forewarn you, even as I did forewarn you, that they who practise such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.",
    "Galatians 5:22": "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,",
    "Galatians 5:23": "meekness, self-control; against such there is no law.",
    "Galatians 5:24": "And they that are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof.",
    "Galatians 5:25": "If we live by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us also walk.",
    "Galatians 5:26": "Let us not become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another.",
    "Galatians 6:1": "Brethren, even if a man be overtaken in any trespass, ye who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to thyself, lest thou also be tempted.",
    "Galatians 6:2": "Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.",
    "Galatians 6:3": "For if a man thinketh himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.",
    "Galatians 6:4": "But let each man prove his own work, and then shall he have his glorying in regard of himself alone, and not of his neighbor.",
    "Galatians 6:5": "For each man shall bear his own burden.",
    "Galatians 6:6": "But let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.",
    "Galatians 6:7": "Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.",
    "Galatians 6:8": "For he that soweth unto his own flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life.",
    "Galatians 6:9": "And let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.",
    "Galatians 6:10": "So then, as we have opportunity, let us work that which is good toward all men, and especially toward them that are of the household of the faith.",
    "Galatians 6:11": "See with how large letters I write unto you with mine own hand.",
    "Galatians 6:12": "As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.",
    "Galatians 6:13": "For not even they who receive circumcision do themselves keep the law; but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.",
    "Galatians 6:14": "But far be it from me to glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world hath been crucified unto me, and I unto the world.",
    "Galatians 6:15": "For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.",
    "Galatians 6:16": "And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.",
    "Galatians 6:17": "Henceforth let no man trouble me; for I bear branded on my body the marks of Jesus.",
    "Galatians 6:18": "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.",
    "Ephesians 1:1": "Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, to the saints that are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus:",
    "Ephesians 1:2": "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "Ephesians 1:3": "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ:",
    "Ephesians 1:4": "even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blemish before him in love:",
    "Ephesians 1:5": "having foreordained us unto adoption as sons through Jesus Christ unto himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,",
    "Ephesians 1:6": "to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved:",
    "Ephesians 1:7": "in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace,",
    "Ephesians 1:8": "which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,",
    "Ephesians 1:9": "making known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him",
    "Ephesians 1:10": "unto a dispensation of the fulness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things upon the earth; in him, I say,",
    "Ephesians 1:11": "in whom also we were made a heritage, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his will;",

    "Ephesians 1:13": "in whom ye also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation,—in whom, having also believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,",
    "Ephesians 1:14": "which is an earnest of our inheritance, unto the redemption of God’s own possession, unto the praise of his glory.",
    "Ephesians 1:15": "For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and the love which ye show toward all the saints,",
    "Ephesians 1:16": "cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;",
    "Ephesians 1:17": "that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him;",
    "Ephesians 1:18": "having the eyes of your heart enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,",
    "Ephesians 1:19": "and what the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might",
    "Ephesians 1:20": "which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places,",
    "Ephesians 1:21": "far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:",
    "Ephesians 1:22": "and he put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the church,",
    "Ephesians 1:23": "which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.",
    "Ephesians 2:1": "And you did he make alive, when ye were dead through your trespasses and sins,",
    "Ephesians 2:2": "wherein ye once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the powers of the air, of the spirit that now worketh in the sons of disobedience;",
    "Ephesians 2:3": "among whom we also all once lived in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest:—",
    "Ephesians 2:4": "but God, being rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,",
    "Ephesians 2:5": "even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace have ye been saved),",
    "Ephesians 2:6": "and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places, in Christ Jesus:",
    "Ephesians 2:7": "that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus:",
    "Ephesians 2:8": "for by grace have ye been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;",
    "Ephesians 2:9": "not of works, that no man should glory.",
    "Ephesians 2:10": "For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God afore prepared that we should walk in them.",
    "Ephesians 2:11": "Wherefore remember, that once ye, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision, in the flesh, made by hands;",
    "Ephesians 2:12": "that ye were at that time separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.",
    "Ephesians 2:13": "But now in Christ Jesus ye that once were far off are made nigh in the blood of Christ.",
    "Ephesians 2:14": "For he is our peace, who made both one, and brake down the middle wall of partition,",
    "Ephesians 2:15": "having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; that he might create in himself of the two one new man, so making peace;",
    "Ephesians 2:16": "and might reconcile them both in one body unto God through the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:",
    "Ephesians 2:17": "and he came and preached peace to you that were far off, and peace to them that were nigh:",
    "Ephesians 2:18": "for through him we both have our access in one Spirit unto the Father.",
    "Ephesians 2:19": "So then ye are no more strangers and sojourners, but ye are fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God,",
    "Ephesians 2:20": "being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief corner stone;",
    "Ephesians 2:21": "in whom each several building, fitly framed together, groweth into a holy temple in the Lord;",

    "Ephesians 3:1": "For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of you Gentiles,—",
    "Ephesians 3:2": "if so be that ye have heard of the dispensation of that grace of God which was given me to you-ward;",
    "Ephesians 3:3": "how that by revelation was made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote before in few words,",
    "Ephesians 3:4": "whereby, when ye read, ye can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ;",
    "Ephesians 3:5": "which in other generations was not made known unto the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;",
    "Ephesians 3:6": "to wit, that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and fellow-members of the body, and fellow-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,",
    "Ephesians 3:7": "whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power.",
    "Ephesians 3:8": "Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach unto the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;",
    "Ephesians 3:9": "and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which for ages hath been hid in God who created all things;",
    "Ephesians 3:10": "to the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places might be made known through the church the manifold wisdom of God,",
    "Ephesians 3:11": "according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:",
    "Ephesians 3:12": "in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.",
    "Ephesians 3:13": "Wherefore I ask that ye may not faint at my tribulations for you, which are your glory.",
    "Ephesians 3:14": "For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father,",
    "Ephesians 3:15": "from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,",
    "Ephesians 3:16": "that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that ye may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man;",
    "Ephesians 3:17": "that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,",
    "Ephesians 3:18": "may be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,",
    "Ephesians 3:19": "and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled unto all the fulness of God.",
    "Ephesians 3:20": "Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,",
    "Ephesians 3:21": "unto him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all generations for ever and ever. Amen.",

    "Ephesians 4:2": "with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;",
    "Ephesians 4:3": "giving diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.",

    "Ephesians 4:6": "one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all.",
    "Ephesians 4:7": "But unto each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.",
    "Ephesians 4:8": "Wherefore he saith, When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive, And gave gifts unto men.",
    "Ephesians 4:9": "(Now this, He ascended, what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth?",
    "Ephesians 4:10": "He that descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.)",

    "Ephesians 4:14": "that we may be no longer children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error;",
    "Ephesians 4:15": "but speaking truth in love, may grow up in all things into him, who is the head, even Christ;",
    "Ephesians 4:16": "from whom all the body fitly framed and knit together through that which every joint supplieth, according to the working in due measure of each several part, maketh the increase of the body unto the building up of itself in love.",
    "Ephesians 4:17": "This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk, in the vanity of their mind,",
    "Ephesians 4:18": "being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their heart;",

    "Ephesians 5:3": "But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becometh saints;",
    "Ephesians 5:4": "nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not befitting: but rather giving of thanks.",
    "Ephesians 5:5": "For this ye know of a surety, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.",
    "Ephesians 5:6": "Let no man deceive you with empty words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience.",
    "Ephesians 5:7": "Be not ye therefore partakers with them;",
    "Ephesians 5:8": "for ye were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord: walk as children of light",
    "Ephesians 5:9": "(for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth),",
    "Ephesians 5:10": "proving what is well-pleasing unto the Lord;",
    "Ephesians 5:11": "and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them;",
    "Ephesians 5:12": "for the things which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of.",
    "Ephesians 5:13": "But all things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light: for everything that is made manifest is light.",
    "Ephesians 5:14": "Wherefore he saith, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon thee.",
    "Ephesians 5:15": "Look therefore carefully how ye walk, not as unwise, but as wise;",
    "Ephesians 5:16": "redeeming the time, because the days are evil.",
    "Ephesians 5:17": "Wherefore be ye not foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.",
    "Ephesians 5:18": "And be not drunken with wine, wherein is riot, but be filled with the Spirit;",
    "Ephesians 5:19": "speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;",

    "Ephesians 5:24": "But as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their husbands in everything.",
    "Ephesians 5:25": "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it;",

    "Ephesians 5:27": "that he might present the church to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.",
    "Ephesians 5:28": "Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his own wife loveth himself:",
    "Ephesians 5:29": "for no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ also the church;",

    "Philippians 2:19": "But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.",
    "Philippians 2:20": "For I have no man likeminded, who will care truly for your state.",
    "Philippians 2:21": "For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.",

    "Philippians 2:30": "because for the work of Christ he came nigh unto death, hazarding his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.",

    "Philippians 3:2": "Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision:",
    "Philippians 3:3": "for we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh:",
    "Philippians 3:4": "though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh: if any other man thinketh to have confidence in the flesh, I yet more:",
    "Philippians 3:5": "circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;",
    "Philippians 3:6": "as touching zeal, persecuting the church; as touching the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless.",
    "Philippians 3:7": "Howbeit what things were gain to me, these have I counted loss for Christ.",
    "Philippians 3:8": "Yea verily, and I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but refuse, that I may gain Christ,",
    "Philippians 3:9": "and be found in him, not having a righteousness of mine own, even that which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith:",

    "Philippians 3:12": "Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect: but I press on, if so be that I may lay hold on that for which also I was laid hold on by Christ Jesus.",
    "Philippians 3:13": "Brethren, I count not myself yet to have laid hold: but one thing I do, forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching forward to the things which are before.",
    "Philippians 3:14": "I press on toward the goal unto the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.",
    "Philippians 3:15": "Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything ye are otherwise minded, this also shall God reveal unto you:",
    "Philippians 3:16": "only, whereunto we have attained, by that same rule let us walk.",
    "Philippians 3:17": "Brethren, be ye imitators together of me, and mark them that so walk even as ye have us for an ensample.",
    "Philippians 3:18": "For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:",
    "Philippians 3:19": "whose end is perdition, whose god is the belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.",
    "Philippians 3:20": "For our citizenship is in heaven; whence also we wait for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:",
    "Philippians 3:21": "who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation, that it may be conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working whereby he is able even to subject all things unto himself.",
    "Philippians 4:1": "Wherefore, my brethren beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my beloved.",
    "Philippians 4:2": "I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in the Lord.",
    "Philippians 4:3": "Yea, I beseech thee also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life.",
    "Philippians 4:4": "Rejoice in the Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice.",
    "Philippians 4:5": "Let your forbearance be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.",

    "Philippians 4:7": "And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.",
    "Philippians 4:8": "Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honorable, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.",
    "Philippians 4:9": "The things which ye both learned and received and heard and saw in me, these things do: and the God of peace shall be with you.",
    "Philippians 4:10": "But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length ye have revived your thought for me; wherein ye did indeed take thought, but ye lacked opportunity.",
    "Philippians 4:11": "Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therein to be content.",
    "Philippians 4:12": "I know how to be abased, and I know also how to abound: in everything and in all things have I learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want.",

    "Philippians 4:14": "Howbeit ye did well that ye had fellowship with my affliction.",
    "Philippians 4:15": "And ye yourselves also know, ye Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church had fellowship with me in the matter of giving and receiving but ye only;",
    "Philippians 4:16": "for even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my need.",
    "Philippians 4:17": "Not that I seek for the gift; but I seek for the fruit that increaseth to your account.",
    "Philippians 4:18": "But I have all things, and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.",
    "Philippians 4:19": "And my God shall supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.",

    "Colossians 3:2": "Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are upon the earth.",
    "Colossians 3:3": "For ye died, and your life is hid with Christ in God.",

    "1 Thessalonians 4:2": "For ye know what charge we gave you through the Lord Jesus.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:3": "For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye abstain from fornication;",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:4": "that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor,",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:5": "not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles who know not God;",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:6": "that no man transgress, and wrong his brother in the matter: because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as also we forewarned you and testified.",

    "1 Thessalonians 4:11": "and that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your hands, even as we charged you;",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:12": "that ye may walk becomingly toward them that are without, and may have need of nothing.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:13": "But we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them that fall asleep; that ye sorrow not, even as the rest, who have no hope.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:14": "For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also that are fallen asleep in Jesus will God bring with him.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:15": "For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we that are alive, that are left unto the coming of the Lord, shall in no wise precede them that are fallen asleep.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:16": "For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first;",

    "1 Thessalonians 5:1": "But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that aught be written unto you.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:2": "For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:3": "When they are saying, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall in no wise escape.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:4": "But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief:",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:5": "for ye are all sons of light, and sons of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness;",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:6": "so then let us not sleep, as do the rest, but let us watch and be sober.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:7": "For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that are drunken are drunken in the night.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:8": "But let us, since we are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:9": "For God appointed us not unto wrath, but unto the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:10": "who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:11": "Wherefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as also ye do.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:12": "But we beseech you, brethren, to know them that labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:13": "and to esteem them exceeding highly in love for their work’s sake. Be at peace among yourselves.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:14": "And we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be longsuffering toward all.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:15": "See that none render unto any one evil for evil; but always follow after that which is good, one toward another, and toward all.",

    "2 Thessalonians 1:4": "so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which ye endure;",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:5": "which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God; to the end that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:6": "if so be that it is a righteous thing with God to recompense affliction to them that afflict you,",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:7": "and to you that are afflicted rest with us, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of his power in flaming fire,",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:8": "rendering vengeance to them that know not God, and to them that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus:",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:9": "who shall suffer punishment, even eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might,",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:10": "when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be marvelled at in all them that believed (because our testimony unto you was believed) in that day.",

    "2 Thessalonians 2:1": "Now we beseech you, brethren, touching the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together unto him;",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:2": "to the end that ye be not quickly shaken from your mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by epistle as from us, as that the day of the Lord is just at hand;",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:3": "let no man beguile you in any wise: for it will not be, except the falling away come first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition,",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:4": "he that opposeth and exalteth himself against all that is called God or that is worshipped; so that he sitteth in the temple of God, setting himself forth as God.",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:5": "Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:6": "And now ye know that which restraineth, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season.",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:7": "For the mystery of lawlessness doth already work: only there is one that restraineth now, until he be taken out of the way.",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:8": "And then shall be revealed the lawless one, whom the Lord Jesus shall slay with the breath of his mouth, and bring to nought by the manifestation of his coming;",

    "2 Thessalonians 3:11": "For we hear of some that walk among you disorderly, that work not at all, but are busybodies.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:12": "Now them that are such we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:13": "But ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:14": "And if any man obeyeth not our word by this epistle, note that man, that ye have no company with him, to the end that he may be ashamed.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:15": "And yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.",

    "Philemon 1:16": "no longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much rather to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord.",
    "Philemon 1:17": "If then thou countest me a partner, receive him as myself.",
    "Philemon 1:18": "But if he hath wronged thee at all, or oweth thee aught, put that to mine account;",
    "Philemon 1:19": "I Paul write it with mine own hand, I will repay it: that I say not unto thee that thou owest to me even thine own self besides.",
    "Philemon 1:20": "Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ.",
    "Philemon 1:21": "Having confidence in thine obedience I write unto thee, knowing that thou wilt do even beyond what I say.",
    "Philemon 1:22": "But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted unto you.",
    "Philemon 1:23": "Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, saluteth thee;",
    "Philemon 1:24": "and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workers.",
    "Philemon 1:25": "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.",
    "Hebrews 1:1": "God, having of old time spoken unto the fathers in the prophets by divers portions and in divers manners,",
    "Hebrews 1:2": "hath at the end of these days spoken unto us in his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the worlds;",
    "Hebrews 1:3": "who being the effulgence of his glory, and the very image of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had made purification of sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;",
    "Hebrews 1:4": "having become by so much better than the angels, as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they.",
    "Hebrews 1:5": "For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, This day have I begotten thee? and again, I will be to him a Father, And he shall be to me a Son?",
    "Hebrews 1:6": "And when he again bringeth in the firstborn into the world he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.",
    "Hebrews 1:7": "And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels winds, And his ministers a flame of fire:",
    "Hebrews 1:8": "but of the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever; And the sceptre of uprightness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.",
    "Hebrews 1:9": "Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee With the oil of gladness above thy fellows.",
    "Hebrews 1:10": "And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning didst lay the foundation of the earth, And the heavens are the works of thy hands:",
    "Hebrews 1:11": "They shall perish; but thou continuest: And they all shall wax old as doth a garment;",
    "Hebrews 1:12": "And as a mantle shalt thou roll them up, As a garment, and they shall be changed: But thou art the same, And thy years shall not fail.",
    "Hebrews 1:13": "But of which of the angels hath he said at any time, Sit thou on my right hand, Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet?",
    "Hebrews 1:14": "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to do service for the sake of them that shall inherit salvation?",
    "Hebrews 2:1": "Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things that were heard, lest haply we drift away from them.",
    "Hebrews 2:2": "For if the word spoken through angels proved stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;",
    "Hebrews 2:3": "how shall we escape, if we neglect so great a salvation? which having at the first been spoken through the Lord, was confirmed unto us by them that heard;",
    "Hebrews 2:4": "God also bearing witness with them, both by signs and wonders, and by manifold powers, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will.",
    "Hebrews 2:5": "For not unto angels did he subject the world to come, whereof we speak.",
    "Hebrews 2:6": "But one hath somewhere testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? Or the son of man, that thou visitest him?",
    "Hebrews 2:7": "Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; Thou crownedst him with glory and honor, And didst set him over the works of thy hands:",
    "Hebrews 2:8": "Thou didst put all things in subjection under his feet.For in that he subjected all things unto him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we see not yet all things subjected to him.",
    "Hebrews 2:9": "But we behold him who hath been made a little lower than the angels, even Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of God he should taste of death for every man.",
    "Hebrews 2:10": "For it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.",
    "Hebrews 2:11": "For both he that sanctifieth and they that are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,",
    "Hebrews 2:12": "saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, In the midst of the congregation will I sing thy praise.",
    "Hebrews 2:13": "And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold, I and the children whom God hath given me.",
    "Hebrews 2:14": "Since then the children are sharers in flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner partook of the same; that through death he might bring to nought him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;",
    "Hebrews 2:15": "and might deliver all them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.",
    "Hebrews 2:16": "For verily not to angels doth he give help, but he giveth help to the seed of Abraham.",
    "Hebrews 2:17": "Wherefore it behooved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren, that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.",
    "Hebrews 2:18": "For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succor them that are tempted.",
    "Hebrews 3:1": "Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, even Jesus;",
    "Hebrews 3:2": "who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.",
    "Hebrews 3:3": "For he hath been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by so much as he that built the house hath more honor than the house.",
    "Hebrews 3:4": "For every house is builded by some one; but he that built all things is God.",
    "Hebrews 3:5": "And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken;",
    "Hebrews 3:6": "but Christ as a son, over his house; whose house are we, if we hold fast our boldness and the glorying of our hope firm unto the end.",
    "Hebrews 3:7": "Wherefore, even as the Holy Spirit saith, To-day if ye shall hear his voice,",
    "Hebrews 3:8": "Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, Like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,",
    "Hebrews 3:9": "Where your fathers tried me by proving me, And saw my works forty years.",
    "Hebrews 3:10": "Wherefore I was displeased with this generation, And said, They do always err in their heart: But they did not know my ways;",
    "Hebrews 3:11": "As I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.",
    "Hebrews 3:12": "Take heed, brethren, lest haply there shall be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God:",
    "Hebrews 3:13": "but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called To-day; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin:",
    "Hebrews 3:14": "for we are become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end:",
    "Hebrews 3:15": "while it is said, To-day if ye shall hear his voice, Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.",
    "Hebrews 3:16": "For who, when they heard, did provoke? nay, did not all they that came out of Egypt by Moses?",
    "Hebrews 3:17": "And with whom was he displeased forty years? was it not with them that sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?",
    "Hebrews 3:18": "And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that were disobedient?",
    "Hebrews 3:19": "And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.",
    "Hebrews 4:1": "Let us fear therefore, lest haply, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you should seem to have come short of it.",
    "Hebrews 4:2": "For indeed we have had good tidings preached unto us, even as also they: but the word of hearing did not profit them, because it was not united by faith with them that heard.",
    "Hebrews 4:3": "For we who have believed do enter into that rest; even as he hath said, As I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest:although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.",
    "Hebrews 4:4": "For he hath said somewhere of the seventh day on this wise, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works;",
    "Hebrews 4:5": "and in this place again, They shall not enter into my rest.",
    "Hebrews 4:6": "Seeing therefore it remaineth that some should enter thereinto, and they to whom the good tidings were before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience,",
    "Hebrews 4:7": "he again defineth a certain day, To-day, saying in David so long a time afterward (even as hath been said before), To-day if ye shall hear his voice, Harden not your hearts.",
    "Hebrews 4:8": "For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day.",
    "Hebrews 4:9": "There remaineth therefore a sabbath rest for the people of God.",
    "Hebrews 4:10": "For he that is entered into his rest hath himself also rested from his works, as God did from his.",
    "Hebrews 4:11": "Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, that no man fall after the same example of disobedience.",
    "Hebrews 4:12": "For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart.",
    "Hebrews 4:13": "And there is no creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do.",
    "Hebrews 4:14": "Having then a great high priest, who hath passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.",
    "Hebrews 4:15": "For we have not a high priest that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but one that hath been in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.",
    "Hebrews 4:16": "Let us therefore draw near with boldness unto the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace to help us in time of need.",
    "Hebrews 5:1": "For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:",
    "Hebrews 5:2": "who can bear gently with the ignorant and erring, for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity;",
    "Hebrews 5:3": "and by reason thereof is bound, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.",
    "Hebrews 5:4": "And no man taketh the honor unto himself, but when he is called of God, even as was Aaron.",
    "Hebrews 5:5": "So Christ also glorified not himself to be made a high priest, but he that spake unto him, Thou art my Son, This day have I begotten thee:",
    "Hebrews 5:6": "as he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek.",
    "Hebrews 5:7": "Who in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear,",
    "Hebrews 5:8": "though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered;",
    "Hebrews 5:9": "and having been made perfect, he became unto all them that obey him the author of eternal salvation;",
    "Hebrews 5:10": "named of God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.",
    "Hebrews 5:11": "Of whom we have many things to say, and hard of interpretation, seeing ye are become dull of hearing.",
    "Hebrews 5:12": "For when by reason of the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need again that some one teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of solid food.",
    "Hebrews 5:13": "For every one that partaketh of milk is without experience of the word of righteousness; for he is a babe.",
    "Hebrews 5:14": "But solid food is for fullgrown men, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil.",
    "Hebrews 6:1": "Wherefore leaving the doctrine of the first principles of Christ, let us press on unto perfection; not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,",
    "Hebrews 6:2": "of the teaching of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.",
    "Hebrews 6:3": "And this will we do, if God permit.",
    "Hebrews 6:4": "For as touching those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit,",
    "Hebrews 6:5": "and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come,",
    "Hebrews 6:6": "and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.",
    "Hebrews 6:7": "For the land which hath drunk the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them for whose sake it is also tilled, receiveth blessing from God:",
    "Hebrews 6:8": "but if it beareth thorns and thistles, it is rejected and nigh unto a curse; whose end is to be burned.",
    "Hebrews 6:9": "But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak:",
    "Hebrews 6:10": "for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and the love which ye showed toward his name, in that ye ministered unto the saints, and still do minister.",
    "Hebrews 6:11": "And we desire that each one of you may show the same diligence unto the fulness of hope even to the end:",
    "Hebrews 6:12": "that ye be not sluggish, but imitators of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.",
    "Hebrews 6:13": "For when God made promise to Abraham, since he could swear by none greater, he sware by himself,",
    "Hebrews 6:14": "saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.",
    "Hebrews 6:15": "And thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.",
    "Hebrews 6:16": "For men swear by the greater: and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation.",
    "Hebrews 6:17": "Wherein God, being minded to show more abundantly unto the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath;",
    "Hebrews 6:18": "that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us:",
    "Hebrews 6:19": "which we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and stedfast and entering into that which is within the veil;",
    "Hebrews 6:20": "whither as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a high priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.",
    "Hebrews 7:1": "For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,",
    "Hebrews 7:2": "to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;",
    "Hebrews 7:3": "without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like unto the Son of God), abideth a priest continually.",
    "Hebrews 7:4": "Now consider how great this man was, unto whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the chief spoils.",
    "Hebrews 7:5": "And they indeed of the sons of Levi that receive the priest’s office have commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though these have come out of the loins of Abraham:",
    "Hebrews 7:6": "but he whose genealogy is not counted from them hath taken tithes of Abraham, and hath blessed him that hath the promises.",
    "Hebrews 7:7": "But without any dispute the less is blessed of the better.",
    "Hebrews 7:8": "And here men that die receive tithes; but there one, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.",
    "Hebrews 7:9": "And, so to say, through Abraham even Levi, who receiveth tithes, hath paid tithes;",
    "Hebrews 7:10": "for he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met him.",
    "Hebrews 7:11": "Now if there was perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it hath the people received the law), what further need was there that another priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be reckoned after the order of Aaron?",
    "Hebrews 7:12": "For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.",
    "Hebrews 7:13": "For he of whom these things are said belongeth to another tribe, from which no man hath given attendance at the altar.",
    "Hebrews 7:14": "For it is evident that our Lord hath sprung out of Judah; as to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priests.",
    "Hebrews 7:15": "And what we say is yet more abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there ariseth another priest,",
    "Hebrews 7:16": "who hath been made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life:",
    "Hebrews 7:17": "for it is witnessed of him, Thou art a priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek.",
    "Hebrews 7:18": "For there is a disannulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness",
    "Hebrews 7:19": "(for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which we draw nigh unto God.",
    "Hebrews 7:20": "And inasmuch as it is not without the taking of an oath",
    "Hebrews 7:21": "(for they indeed have been made priests without an oath; but he with an oath by him that saith of him, The Lord sware and will not repent himself, Thou art a priest for ever);",
    "Hebrews 7:22": "by so much also hath Jesus become the surety of a better covenant.",
    "Hebrews 7:23": "And they indeed have been made priests many in number, because that by death they are hindered from continuing:",
    "Hebrews 7:24": "but he, because he abideth for ever, hath his priesthood unchangeable.",
    "Hebrews 7:25": "Wherefore also he is able to save to the uttermost them that draw near unto God through him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.",
    "Hebrews 7:26": "For such a high priest became us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;",
    "Hebrews 7:27": "who needeth not daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people: for this he did once for all, when he offered up himself.",
    "Hebrews 7:28": "For the law appointeth men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the law, appointeth a Son, perfected for evermore.",
    "Hebrews 8:1": "Now in the things which we are saying the chief point is this We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,",
    "Hebrews 8:2": "a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.",
    "Hebrews 8:3": "For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that this high priest also have somewhat to offer.",
    "Hebrews 8:4": "Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are those who offer the gifts according to the law;",
    "Hebrews 8:5": "who serve that which is a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses is warned of God when he is about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern that was showed thee in the mount.",
    "Hebrews 8:6": "But now hath he obtained a ministry the more excellent, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which hath been enacted upon better promises.",
    "Hebrews 8:7": "For if that first covenant had been faultless, then would no place have been sought for a second.",
    "Hebrews 8:8": "For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, That I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;",
    "Hebrews 8:9": "Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers In the day that I took them by the hand to lead them forth out of the land of Egypt; For they continued not in my covenant, And I regarded them not, saith the Lord.",
    "Hebrews 8:10": "For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel After those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, And on their heart also will I write them: And I will be to them a God, And they shall be to me a people:",
    "Hebrews 8:11": "And they shall not teach every man his fellow-citizen, And every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: For all shall know me, From the least to the greatest of them.",
    "Hebrews 8:12": "For I will be merciful to their iniquities, And their sins will I remember no more.",
    "Hebrews 8:13": "In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. But that which is becoming old and waxeth aged is nigh unto vanishing away.",
    "Hebrews 9:1": "Now even the first covenant had ordinances of divine service, and its sanctuary, a sanctuary of this world.",
    "Hebrews 9:2": "For there was a tabernacle prepared, the first, wherein were the candlestick, and the table, and the showbread; which is called the Holy place.",
    "Hebrews 9:3": "And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holy of holies;",
    "Hebrews 9:4": "having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was a golden pot holding the manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;",
    "Hebrews 9:5": "and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat; of which things we cannot now speak severally.",
    "Hebrews 9:6": "Now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services;",
    "Hebrews 9:7": "but into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offereth for himself, and for the errors of the people:",
    "Hebrews 9:8": "the Holy Spirit this signifying, that the way into the holy place hath not yet been made manifest, while the first tabernacle is yet standing;",
    "Hebrews 9:9": "which is a figure for the time present; according to which are offered both gifts and sacrifices that cannot, as touching the conscience, make the worshipper perfect,",
    "Hebrews 9:10": "being only (with meats and drinks and divers washings) carnal ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation.",
    "Hebrews 9:11": "But Christ having come a high priest of the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation,",
    "Hebrews 9:12": "nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption.",
    "Hebrews 9:13": "For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling them that have been defiled, sanctify unto the cleanness of the flesh:",
    "Hebrews 9:14": "how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish unto God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?",
    "Hebrews 9:15": "And for this cause he is the mediator of a new covenant, that a death having taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, they that have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.",
    "Hebrews 9:16": "For where a testament is, there must of necessity be the death of him that made it.",
    "Hebrews 9:17": "For a testament is of force where there hath been death: for it doth never avail while he that made it liveth.",
    "Hebrews 9:18": "Wherefore even the first covenant hath not been dedicated without blood.",
    "Hebrews 9:19": "For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses unto all the people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,",
    "Hebrews 9:20": "saying, This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded to you-ward.",
    "Hebrews 9:21": "Moreover the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry he sprinkled in like manner with the blood.",
    "Hebrews 9:22": "And according to the law, I may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission.",
    "Hebrews 9:23": "It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.",
    "Hebrews 9:24": "For Christ entered not into a holy place made with hands, like in pattern to the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God for us:",
    "Hebrews 9:25": "nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place year by year with blood not his own;",
    "Hebrews 9:26": "else must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once at the end of the ages hath he been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.",
    "Hebrews 9:27": "And inasmuch as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this cometh judgment;",
    "Hebrews 9:28": "so Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear a second time, apart from sin, to them that wait for him, unto salvation.",
    "Hebrews 10:1": "For the law having a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect them that draw nigh.",
    "Hebrews 10:2": "Else would they not have ceased to be offered? because the worshippers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins.",
    "Hebrews 10:3": "But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance made of sins year by year.",
    "Hebrews 10:4": "For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.",
    "Hebrews 10:5": "Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, But a body didst thou prepare for me;",
    "Hebrews 10:6": "In whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hadst no pleasure:",
    "Hebrews 10:7": "Then said I, Lo, I am come (In the roll of the book it is written of me) To do thy will, O God.",
    "Hebrews 10:8": "Saying above, Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein (the which are offered according to the law),",
    "Hebrews 10:9": "then hath he said, Lo, I am come to do thy will. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.",
    "Hebrews 10:10": "By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.",
    "Hebrews 10:11": "And every priest indeed standeth day by day ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, the which can never take away sins:",
    "Hebrews 10:12": "but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;",
    "Hebrews 10:13": "henceforth expecting till his enemies be made the footstool of his feet.",
    "Hebrews 10:14": "For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.",
    "Hebrews 10:15": "And the Holy Spirit also beareth witness to us; for after he hath said,",
    "Hebrews 10:16": "This is the covenant that I will make with them After those days, saith the Lord: I will put my laws on their heart, And upon their mind also will I write them; then saith he,",
    "Hebrews 10:17": "And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.",
    "Hebrews 10:18": "Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.",
    "Hebrews 10:19": "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,",
    "Hebrews 10:20": "by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;",
    "Hebrews 10:21": "and having a great priest over the house of God;",
    "Hebrews 10:22": "let us draw near with a true heart in fulness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience: and having our body washed with pure water,",
    "Hebrews 10:23": "let us hold fast the confession of our hope that it waver not; for he is faithful that promised:",
    "Hebrews 10:24": "and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works;",
    "Hebrews 10:25": "not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more, as ye see the day drawing nigh.",
    "Hebrews 10:26": "For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more a sacrifice for sins,",
    "Hebrews 10:27": "but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which shall devour the adversaries.",
    "Hebrews 10:28": "A man that hath set at nought Moses’ law dieth without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses:",
    "Hebrews 10:29": "of how much sorer punishment, think ye, shall he be judged worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?",
    "Hebrews 10:30": "For we know him that said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.",
    "Hebrews 10:31": "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.",
    "Hebrews 10:32": "But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were enlightened, ye endured a great conflict of sufferings;",
    "Hebrews 10:33": "partly, being made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, becoming partakers with them that were so used.",
    "Hebrews 10:34": "For ye both had compassion on them that were in bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your possessions, knowing that ye have for yourselves a better possession and an abiding one.",
    "Hebrews 10:35": "Cast not away therefore your boldness, which hath great recompense of reward.",
    "Hebrews 10:36": "For ye have need of patience, that, having done the will of God, ye may receive the promise.",
    "Hebrews 10:37": "For yet a very little while, He that cometh shall come, and shall not tarry.",
    "Hebrews 10:38": "But my righteous one shall live by faith: And if he shrink back, my soul hath no pleasure in him.",
    "Hebrews 10:39": "But we are not of them that shrink back unto perdition; but of them that have faith unto the saving of the soul.",
    "Hebrews 11:1": "Now faith is assurance of things hoped for, a conviction of things not seen.",
    "Hebrews 11:2": "For therein the elders had witness borne to them.",
    "Hebrews 11:3": "By faith we understand that the worlds have been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen hath not been made out of things which appear.",
    "Hebrews 11:4": "By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had witness borne to him that he was righteous, God bearing witness in respect of his gifts: and through it he being dead yet speaketh.",
    "Hebrews 11:5": "By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God translated him: for he hath had witness borne to him that before his translation he had been well-pleasing unto God:",
    "Hebrews 11:6": "and without faith it is impossible to be well-pleasing unto him; for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that seek after him.",
    "Hebrews 11:7": "By faith Noah, being warned of God concerning things not seen as yet, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.",
    "Hebrews 11:8": "By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out unto a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.",
    "Hebrews 11:9": "By faith he became a sojourner in the land of promise, as in a land not his own, dwelling in tents, with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:",
    "Hebrews 11:10": "for he looked for the city which hath the foundations, whose builder and maker is God.",
    "Hebrews 11:11": "By faith even Sarah herself received power to conceive seed when she was past age, since she counted him faithful who had promised:",
    "Hebrews 11:12": "wherefore also there sprang of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of heaven in multitude, and as the sand, which is by the sea-shore, innumerable.",
    "Hebrews 11:13": "These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.",
    "Hebrews 11:14": "For they that say such things make it manifest that they are seeking after a country of their own.",
    "Hebrews 11:15": "And if indeed they had been mindful of that country from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return.",
    "Hebrews 11:16": "But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God; for he hath prepared for them a city.",
    "Hebrews 11:17": "By faith Abraham, being tried, offered up Isaac: yea, he that had gladly received the promises was offering up his only begotten son;",
    "Hebrews 11:18": "even he to whom it was said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called:",
    "Hebrews 11:19": "accounting that God is able to raise up, even from the dead; from whence he did also in a figure receive him back.",
    "Hebrews 11:20": "By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come.",

    "Hebrews 11:39": "And these all, having had witness borne to them through their faith, received not the promise,",
    "Hebrews 11:40": "God having provided some better thing concerning us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect.",

    "Hebrews 12:5": "and ye have forgotten the exhortation which reasoneth with you as with sons, My son, regard not lightly the chastening of the Lord, Nor faint when thou art reproved of him;",
    "Hebrews 12:6": "For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, And scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.",
    "Hebrews 12:7": "It is for chastening that ye endure; God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father chasteneth not?",
    "Hebrews 12:8": "But if ye are without chastening, whereof all have been made partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.",

    "Hebrews 12:14": "Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man shall see the Lord:",
    "Hebrews 12:15": "looking carefully lest there be any man that falleth short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby the many be defiled;",
    "Hebrews 12:16": "lest there be any fornication, or profane person, as Esau, who for one mess of meat sold his own birthright.",
    "Hebrews 12:17": "For ye know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place for a change of mind in his father, though he sought it diligently with tears.",
    "Hebrews 12:18": "For ye are not come unto a mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,",
    "Hebrews 12:19": "and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard entreated that no word more should be spoken unto them;",
    "Hebrews 12:20": "for they could not endure that which was enjoined, If even a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned;",
    "Hebrews 12:21": "and so fearful was the appearance, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:",
    "Hebrews 12:22": "but ye are come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable hosts of angels,",
    "Hebrews 12:23": "to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,",
    "Hebrews 12:24": "and to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better than that of Abel.",
    "Hebrews 12:25": "See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not when they refused him that warned them on earth, much more shall not we escape who turn away from him that warneth from heaven:",
    "Hebrews 12:26": "whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more will I make to tremble not the earth only, but also the heaven.",
    "Hebrews 12:27": "And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain.",
    "Hebrews 12:28": "Wherefore, receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us have grace, whereby we may offer service well-pleasing to God with reverence and awe:",
    "Hebrews 12:29": "for our God is a consuming fire.",

    "Hebrews 13:5": "Be ye free from the love of money; content with such things as ye have: for himself hath said, I will in no wise fail thee, neither will I in any wise forsake thee.",
    "Hebrews 13:6": "So that with good courage we say, The Lord is my helper; I will not fear: What shall man do unto me?",
    "Hebrews 13:7": "Remember them that had the rule over you, men that spake unto you the word of God; and considering the issue of their life, imitate their faith.",
    "Hebrews 13:8": "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and to-day, (yea) and for ever.",
    "Hebrews 13:9": "Be not carried away by divers and strange teachings: for it is good that the heart be established by grace; not by meats, wherein they that occupied themselves were not profited.",
    "Hebrews 13:10": "We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat that serve the tabernacle.",
    "Hebrews 13:11": "For the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned without the camp.",
    "Hebrews 13:12": "Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered without the gate.",
    "Hebrews 13:13": "Let us therefore go forth unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.",
    "Hebrews 13:14": "For we have not here an abiding city, but we seek after the city which is to come.",
    "Hebrews 13:15": "Through him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of lips which make confession to his name.",
    "Hebrews 13:16": "But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.",
    "Hebrews 13:17": "Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit to them: for they watch in behalf of your souls, as they that shall give account; that they may do this with joy, and not with grief: for this were unprofitable for you.",
    "Hebrews 13:18": "Pray for us: for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring to live honorably in all things.",
    "Hebrews 13:19": "And I exhort you the more exceedingly to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.",
    "Hebrews 13:20": "Now the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant, even our Lord Jesus,",
    "Hebrews 13:21": "make you perfect in every good thing to do his will, working in us that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.",
    "Hebrews 13:22": "But I exhort you, brethren, bear with the word of exhortation: for I have written unto you in few words.",
    "Hebrews 13:23": "Know ye that our brother Timothy hath been set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.",
    "Hebrews 13:24": "Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.",
    "Hebrews 13:25": "Grace be with you all. Amen.",
    "James 1:1": "James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are of the Dispersion, greeting.",
    "James 1:2": "Count it all joy, my brethren, when ye fall into manifold temptations;",
    "James 1:3": "knowing that the proving of your faith worketh patience.",
    "James 1:4": "And let patience have its perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, lacking in nothing.",
    "James 1:5": "But if any of you lacketh wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.",
    "James 1:6": "But let him ask in faith, nothing doubting: for he that doubteth is like the surge of the sea driven by the wind and tossed.",
    "James 1:7": "For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord;",
    "James 1:8": "a doubleminded man, unstable in all his ways.",
    "James 1:9": "But let the brother of low degree glory in his high estate:",
    "James 1:10": "and the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.",
    "James 1:11": "For the sun ariseth with the scorching wind, and withereth the grass; and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his goings.",
    "James 1:12": "Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he hath been approved, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to them that love him.",
    "James 1:13": "Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempteth no man:",
    "James 1:14": "but each man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed.",
    "James 1:15": "Then the lust, when it hath conceived, beareth sin: and the sin, when it is fullgrown, bringeth forth death.",
    "James 1:16": "Be not deceived, my beloved brethren.",
    "James 1:17": "Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, neither shadow that is cast by turning.",
    "James 1:18": "Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.",
    "James 1:19": "Ye know this, my beloved brethren. But let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:",
    "James 1:20": "for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.",
    "James 1:21": "Wherefore putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.",
    "James 1:22": "But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deluding your own selves.",
    "James 1:23": "For if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror:",
    "James 1:24": "for he beholdeth himself, and goeth away, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.",
    "James 1:25": "But he that looketh into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and so continueth, being not a hearer that forgetteth but a doer that worketh, this man shall be blessed in his doing.",
    "James 1:26": "If any man thinketh himself to be religious, while he bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his heart, this man’s religion is vain.",
    "James 1:27": "Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.",
    "James 2:1": "My brethren, hold not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.",
    "James 2:2": "For if there come into your synagogue a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, and there come in also a poor man in vile clothing;",
    "James 2:3": "and ye have regard to him that weareth the fine clothing, and say, Sit thou here in a good place; and ye say to the poor man, Stand thou there, or sit under my footstool;",
    "James 2:4": "do ye not make distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?",
    "James 2:5": "Hearken, my beloved brethren; did not God choose them that are poor as to the world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he promised to them that love him?",
    "James 2:6": "But ye have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you, and themselves drag you before the judgment-seats?",
    "James 2:7": "Do not they blaspheme the honorable name by which ye are called?",
    "James 2:8": "Howbeit if ye fulfil the royal law, according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well:",
    "James 2:9": "but if ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.",
    "James 2:10": "For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is become guilty of all.",
    "James 2:11": "For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou dost not commit adultery, but killest, thou art become a transgressor of the law.",
    "James 2:12": "So speak ye, and so do, as men that are to be judged by a law of liberty.",
    "James 2:13": "For judgment is without mercy to him that hath showed no mercy: mercy glorieth against judgment.",
    "James 2:14": "What doth it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but have not works? can that faith save him?",
    "James 2:15": "If a brother or sister be naked and in lack of daily food,",
    "James 2:16": "and one of you say unto them, Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; and yet ye give them not the things needful to the body; what doth it profit?",
    "James 2:17": "Even so faith, if it have not works, is dead in itself.",
    "James 2:18": "Yea, a man will say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: show me thy faith apart from thy works, and I by my works will show thee my faith.",
    "James 2:19": "Thou believest that God is one; thou doest well: the demons also believe, and shudder.",
    "James 2:20": "But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith apart from works is barren?",
    "James 2:21": "Was not Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son upon the altar?",
    "James 2:22": "Thou seest that faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect;",
    "James 2:23": "and the scripture was fulfilled which saith, And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God.",
    "James 2:24": "Ye see that by works a man is justified, and not only by faith.",
    "James 2:25": "And in like manner was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way?",
    "James 2:26": "For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.",
    "James 3:1": "Be not many of you teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive heavier judgment.",
    "James 3:2": "For in many things we all stumble. If any stumbleth not in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also.",
    "James 3:3": "Now if we put the horses’ bridles into their mouths that they may obey us, we turn about their whole body also.",
    "James 3:4": "Behold, the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by rough winds, are yet turned about by a very small rudder, whither the impulse of the steersman willeth.",
    "James 3:5": "So the tongue also is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how much wood is kindled by how small a fire!",
    "James 3:6": "And the tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the wheel of nature, and is set on fire by hell.",
    "James 3:7": "For every kind of beasts and birds, of creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind:",
    "James 3:8": "but the tongue can no man tame; it is a restless evil, it is full of deadly poison.",
    "James 3:9": "Therewith bless we the Lord and Father; and therewith curse we men, who are made after the likeness of God:",
    "James 3:10": "out of the same mouth cometh forth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.",
    "James 3:11": "Doth the fountain send forth from the same opening sweet water and bitter?",
    "James 3:12": "Can a fig tree, my brethren, yield olives, or a vine figs? neither can salt water yield sweet.",
    "James 3:13": "Who is wise and understanding among you? let him show by his good life his works in meekness of wisdom.",
    "James 3:14": "But if ye have bitter jealousy and faction in your heart, glory not and lie not against the truth.",
    "James 3:15": "This wisdom is not a wisdom that cometh down from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.",
    "James 3:16": "For where jealousy and faction are, there is confusion and every vile deed.",
    "James 3:17": "But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without variance, without hypocrisy.",
    "James 3:18": "And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for them that make peace.",
    "James 4:1": "Whence come wars and whence come fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your pleasures that war in your members?",
    "James 4:2": "Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and covet, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war; ye have not, because ye ask not.",
    "James 4:3": "Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may spend it in your pleasures.",
    "James 4:4": "Ye adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore would be a friend of the world maketh himself an enemy of God.",
    "James 4:5": "Or think ye that the scripture speaketh in vain? Doth the spirit which he made to dwell in us long unto envying?",
    "James 4:6": "But he giveth more grace. Wherefore the scripture saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.",
    "James 4:7": "Be subject therefore unto God; but resist the devil, and he will flee from you.",
    "James 4:8": "Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye doubleminded.",
    "James 4:9": "Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.",
    "James 4:10": "Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall exalt you.",

    "1 Peter 3:16": "having a good conscience; that, wherein ye are spoken against, they may be put to shame who revile your good manner of life in Christ.",
    "1 Peter 3:17": "For it is better, if the will of God should so will, that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing.",
    "1 Peter 3:18": "Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;",
    "1 Peter 3:19": "in which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison,",
    "1 Peter 3:20": "that aforetime were disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water:",
    "1 Peter 3:21": "which also after a true likeness doth now save you, even baptism, not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the interrogation of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ;",

    "1 Peter 4:3": "For the time past may suffice to have wrought the desire of the Gentiles, and to have walked in lasciviousness, lusts, winebibbings, revellings, carousings, and abominable idolatries:",
    "1 Peter 4:4": "wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them into the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:",
    "1 Peter 4:5": "who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the living and the dead.",
    "1 Peter 4:6": "For unto this end was the gospel preached even to the dead, that they might be judged indeed according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.",
    "1 Peter 4:7": "But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore of sound mind, and be sober unto prayer:",

    "1 Peter 4:9": "using hospitality one to another without murmuring:",
    "1 Peter 4:10": "according as each hath received a gift, ministering it among yourselves, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God;",

    "1 Peter 4:12": "Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial among you, which cometh upon you to prove you, as though a strange thing happened unto you:",
    "1 Peter 4:13": "but insomuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings, rejoice; that at the revelation of his glory also ye may rejoice with exceeding joy.",
    "1 Peter 4:14": "If ye are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed are ye; because the Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God resteth upon you.",
    "1 Peter 4:15": "For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil-doer, or as a meddler in other men’s matters:",
    "1 Peter 4:16": "but if a man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this name.",
    "1 Peter 4:17": "For the time is come for judgment to begin at the house of God: and if it begin first at us, what shall be the end of them that obey not the gospel of God?",
    "1 Peter 4:18": "And if the righteous is scarcely saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner appear?",

    "1 Peter 5:5": "Likewise, ye younger, be subject unto the elder. Yea, all of you gird yourselves with humility, to serve one another: for God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.",
    "1 Peter 5:6": "Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time;",
    "1 Peter 5:7": "casting all your anxiety upon him, because he careth for you.",
    "1 Peter 5:8": "Be sober, be watchful: your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour,",
