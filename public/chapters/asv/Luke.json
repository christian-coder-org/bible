    "Malachi 1:4": "Whereas Edom saith, We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places; thus saith Jehovah of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and men shall call them The border of wickedness, and The people against whom Jehovah hath indignation for ever.",

    "Malachi 3:3": "and he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and silver; and they shall offer unto Jehovah offerings in righteousness.",
    "Malachi 3:4": "Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.",
    "Malachi 3:5": "And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against the false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the sojourner from his right, and fear not me, saith Jehovah of hosts.",

    "Malachi 3:9": "Ye are cursed with the curse; for ye rob me, even this whole nation.",
    "Malachi 3:10": "Bring ye the whole tithe into the store-house, that there may be food in my house, and prove me now herewith, saith Jehovah of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.",

    "Malachi 3:13": "Your words have been stout against me, saith Jehovah. Yet ye say, What have we spoken against thee?",
    "Malachi 3:14": "Ye have said, It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we have kept his charge, and that we have walked mournfully before Jehovah of hosts?",
    "Malachi 3:15": "and now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are built up; yea, they tempt God, and escape.",
    "Malachi 3:16": "Then they that feared Jehovah spake one with another; and Jehovah hearkened, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before him, for them that feared Jehovah, and that thought upon his name.",
    "Malachi 3:17": "And they shall be mine, saith Jehovah of hosts, even mine own possession, in the day that I make; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.",
    "Malachi 3:18": "Then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.",

    "Matthew 26:8": "But when the disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?",
    "Matthew 26:9": "For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.",
    "Matthew 26:10": "But Jesus perceiving it said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.",
    "Matthew 26:11": "For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.",

    "Matthew 26:32": "But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.",
    "Matthew 26:33": "But Peter answered and said unto him, If all shall be offended in thee, I will never be offended.",

    "Matthew 26:42": "Again a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, thy will be done.",
    "Matthew 26:43": "And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.",
    "Matthew 26:44": "And he left them again, and went away, and prayed a third time, saying again the same words.",

    "Matthew 27:41": "In like manner also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,",
    "Matthew 27:42": "He saved others; himself he cannot save. He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on him.",
    "Matthew 27:43": "He trusteth on God; let him deliver him now, if he desireth him: for he said, I am the Son of God.",

    "Mark 7:13": "making void the word of God by your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things ye do.",
    "Mark 7:14": "And he called to him the multitude again, and said unto them, Hear me all of you, and understand:",
    "Mark 7:15": "there is nothing from without the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.",
    "Mark 7:16": "",
    "Mark 7:17": "And when he was entered into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked of him the parable.",
    "Mark 7:18": "And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Perceive ye not, that whatsoever from without goeth into the man, it cannot defile him;",
    "Mark 7:19": "because it goeth not into his heart, but into his belly, and goeth out into the draught? This he said, making all meats clean.",
    "Mark 7:20": "And he said, That which proceedeth out of the man, that defileth the man.",
    "Mark 7:21": "For from within, out of the heart of men, evil thoughts proceed, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries,",
    "Mark 7:22": "covetings, wickednesses, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, railing, pride, foolishness:",
    "Mark 7:23": "all these evil things proceed from within, and defile the man.",

    "Mark 8:4": "And his disciples answered him, Whence shall one be able to fill these men with bread here in a desert place?",
    "Mark 8:5": "And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.",
    "Mark 8:6": "And he commandeth the multitude to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, he brake, and gave to his disciples, to set before them; and they set them before the multitude.",
    "Mark 8:7": "And they had a few small fishes: and having blessed them, he commanded to set these also before them.",
    "Mark 8:8": "And they ate, and were filled: and they took up, of broken pieces that remained over, seven baskets.",

    "Mark 8:11": "And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, trying him.",
    "Mark 8:12": "And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.",
    "Mark 8:13": "And he left them, and again entering into the boat departed to the other side.",
    "Mark 8:14": "And they forgot to take bread; and they had not in the boat with them more than one loaf.",
    "Mark 8:15": "And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.",
    "Mark 8:16": "And they reasoned one with another, saying, We have no bread.",
    "Mark 8:17": "And Jesus perceiving it saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? do ye not yet perceive, neither understand? have ye your heart hardened?",
    "Mark 8:18": "Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?",

    "Luke 8:3": "and Joanna the wife of Chuzas Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered unto them of their substance.",
    "Luke 8:4": "And when a great multitude came together, and they of every city resorted unto him, he spake by a parable:",
    "Luke 8:5": "The sower went forth to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden under foot, and the birds of the heaven devoured it.",
    "Luke 8:6": "And other fell on the rock; and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture.",
    "Luke 8:7": "And other fell amidst the thorns; and the thorns grew with it, and choked it.",
    "Luke 8:8": "And other fell into the good ground, and grew, and brought forth fruit a hundredfold. As he said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.",
    "Luke 8:9": "And his disciples asked him what this parable might be.",
    "Luke 8:10": "And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to the rest in parables; that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.",
    "Luke 8:11": "Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.",
    "Luke 8:12": "And those by the way side are they that have heard; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.",
    "Luke 8:13": "And those on the rock are they who, when they have heard, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.",
    "Luke 8:14": "And that which fell among the thorns, these are they that have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.",
    "Luke 8:15": "And that in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it fast, and bring forth fruit with patience.",
    "Luke 8:16": "And no man, when he hath lighted a lamp, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but putteth it on a stand, that they that enter in may see the light.",
    "Luke 8:17": "For nothing is hid, that shall not be made manifest; nor anything secret, that shall not be known and come to light.",
    "Luke 8:18": "Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he thinketh he hath.",
    "Luke 8:19": "And there came to him his mother and brethren, and they could not come at him for the crowd.",
    "Luke 8:20": "And it was told him, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.",
    "Luke 8:21": "But he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these that hear the word of God, and do it.",
    "Luke 8:22": "Now it came to pass on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples; and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake: and they launched forth.",
    "Luke 8:23": "But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filling with water, and were in jeopardy.",
    "Luke 8:24": "And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. And he awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.",
    "Luke 8:25": "And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And being afraid they marvelled, saying one to another, Who then is this, that he commandeth even the winds and the water, and they obey him?",
    "Luke 8:26": "And they arrived at the country of the Gerasenes, which is over against Galilee.",
    "Luke 8:27": "And when he was come forth upon the land, there met him a certain man out of the city, who had demons; and for a long time he had worn no clothes, and abode not in any house, but in the tombs.",
    "Luke 8:28": "And when he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? I beseech thee, torment me not.",
    "Luke 8:29": "For he was commanding the unclean spirit to come out from the man. For oftentimes it had seized him: and he was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters; and breaking the bands asunder, he was driven of the demon into the deserts.",
    "Luke 8:30": "And Jesus asked him, What is thy name? And he said, Legion; for many demons were entered into him.",
    "Luke 8:31": "And they entreated him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss.",
    "Luke 8:32": "Now there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they entreated him that he would give them leave to enter into them. And he gave them leave.",
    "Luke 8:33": "And the demons came out from the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake, and were drowned.",
    "Luke 8:34": "And when they that fed them saw what had come to pass, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.",
    "Luke 8:35": "And they went out to see what had come to pass; and they came to Jesus, and found the man, from whom the demons were gone out, sitting, clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus: and they were afraid.",
    "Luke 8:36": "And they that saw it told them how he that was possessed with demons was made whole.",
    "Luke 8:37": "And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes round about asked him to depart from them; for they were holden with great fear: and he entered into a boat, and returned.",
    "Luke 8:38": "But the man from whom the demons were gone out prayed him that he might be with him: but he sent him away, saying,",
    "Luke 8:39": "Return to thy house, and declare how great things God hath done for thee. And he went his way, publishing throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done for him.",
    "Luke 8:40": "And as Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him; for they were all waiting for him.",
    "Luke 8:41": "And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus’ feet, and besought him to come into his house;",
    "Luke 8:42": "for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went the multitudes thronged him.",
    "Luke 8:43": "And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, who had spent all her living upon physicians, and could not be healed of any,",
    "Luke 8:44": "came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately the issue of her blood stanched.",
    "Luke 8:45": "And Jesus said, Who is it that touched me? And when all denied, Peter said, and they that were with him, Master, the multitudes press thee and crush thee.",
    "Luke 8:46": "But Jesus said, Some one did touch me; for I perceived that power had gone forth from me.",
    "Luke 8:47": "And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people for what cause she touched him, and how she was healed immediately.",
    "Luke 8:48": "And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.",
    "Luke 8:49": "While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house, saying, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher.",
    "Luke 8:50": "But Jesus hearing it, answered him, Fear not: only believe, and she shall be made whole.",
    "Luke 8:51": "And when he came to the house, he suffered not any man to enter in with him, save Peter, and John, and James, and the father of the maiden and her mother.",
    "Luke 8:52": "And all were weeping, and bewailing her: but he said, Weep not; for she is not dead, but sleepeth.",
    "Luke 8:53": "And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.",
    "Luke 8:54": "But he, taking her by the hand, called, saying, Maiden, arise.",
    "Luke 8:55": "And her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately: and he commanded that something be given her to eat.",
    "Luke 8:56": "And her parents were amazed: but he charged them to tell no man what had been done.",
    "Luke 9:1": "And he called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.",
    "Luke 9:2": "And he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.",
    "Luke 9:3": "And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staff, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats.",
    "Luke 9:4": "And into whatsoever house ye enter, there abide, and thence depart.",
    "Luke 9:5": "And as many as receive you not, when ye depart from that city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.",
    "Luke 9:6": "And they departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the gospel, and healing everywhere.",
    "Luke 9:7": "Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done: and he was much perplexed, because that it was said by some, that John was risen from the dead;",
    "Luke 9:8": "and by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.",
    "Luke 9:9": "And Herod said, John I beheaded: but who is this, about whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.",
    "Luke 9:10": "And the apostles, when they were returned, declared unto him what things they had done. And he took them, and withdrew apart to a city, called Bethsaida.",
    "Luke 9:11": "But the multitudes perceiving it followed him: and he welcomed them, and spake to them of the kingdom of God, and them that had need of healing he cured.",
    "Luke 9:12": "And the day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages and country round about, and lodge, and get provisions: for we are here in a desert place.",
    "Luke 9:13": "But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy food for all this people.",
    "Luke 9:14": "For they were about five thousand men. And he said unto his disciples, Make them sit down in companies, about fifty each.",
    "Luke 9:15": "And they did so, and made them all sit down.",
    "Luke 9:16": "And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake; and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.",
    "Luke 9:17": "And they ate, and were all filled: and there was taken up that which remained over to them of broken pieces, twelve baskets.",
    "Luke 9:18": "And it came to pass, as he was praying apart, the disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Who do the multitudes say that I am?",
    "Luke 9:19": "And they answering said, John the Baptist; but others say, Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again.",
    "Luke 9:20": "And he said unto them, But who say ye that I am? And Peter answering said, The Christ of God.",
    "Luke 9:21": "But he charged them, and commanded them to tell this to no man;",
    "Luke 9:22": "saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.",
    "Luke 9:23": "And he said unto all, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.",
    "Luke 9:24": "For whosoever would save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.",
    "Luke 9:25": "For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose or forfeit his own self?",
    "Luke 9:26": "For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in his own glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels.",
    "Luke 9:27": "But I tell you of a truth, There are some of them that stand here, who shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.",
    "Luke 9:28": "And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray.",
    "Luke 9:29": "And as he was praying, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment became white and dazzling.",
    "Luke 9:30": "And behold, there talked with him two men, who were Moses and Elijah;",
    "Luke 9:31": "who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.",
    "Luke 9:32": "Now Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.",
    "Luke 9:33": "And it came to pass, as they were parting from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: not knowing what he said.",
    "Luke 9:34": "And while he said these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.",
    "Luke 9:35": "And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my Son, my chosen: hear ye him.",
    "Luke 9:36": "And when the voice came, Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace, and told no man in those days any of the things which they had seen.",
    "Luke 9:37": "And it came to pass, on the next day, when they were come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.",
    "Luke 9:38": "And behold, a man from the multitude cried, saying, Teacher, I beseech thee to look upon my son; for he is mine only child:",
    "Luke 9:39": "and behold, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth, and it hardly departeth from him, bruising him sorely.",
    "Luke 9:40": "And I besought thy disciples to cast it out; and they could not.",
    "Luke 9:41": "And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? bring hither thy son.",
    "Luke 9:42": "And as he was yet a coming, the demon dashed him down, and tare him grievously. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.",
    "Luke 9:43": "And they were all astonished at the majesty of God.But while all were marvelling at all the things which he did, he said unto his disciples,",
    "Luke 9:44": "Let these words sink into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men.",
    "Luke 9:45": "But they understood not this saying, and it was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.",
    "Luke 9:46": "And there arose a reasoning among them, which of them was the greatest.",
    "Luke 9:47": "But when Jesus saw the reasoning of their heart, he took a little child, and set him by his side,",
    "Luke 9:48": "and said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same is great.",
    "Luke 9:49": "And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he followeth not with us.",
    "Luke 9:50": "But Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against you is for you.",
    "Luke 9:51": "And it came to pass, when the days were well-nigh come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,",
    "Luke 9:52": "and sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.",
    "Luke 9:53": "And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he were going to Jerusalem.",
    "Luke 9:54": "And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we bid fire to come down from heaven, and consume them?",
    "Luke 9:55": "But he turned, and rebuked them.",
    "Luke 9:56": "And they went to another village.",
    "Luke 9:57": "And as they went on the way, a certain man said unto him, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.",
    "Luke 9:58": "And Jesus said unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.",
    "Luke 9:59": "And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.",
    "Luke 9:60": "But he said unto him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead; but go thou and publish abroad the kingdom of God.",
    "Luke 9:61": "And another also said, I will follow thee, Lord; but first suffer me to bid farewell to them that are at my house.",
    "Luke 9:62": "But Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.",
    "Luke 10:1": "Now after these things the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself was about to come.",
    "Luke 10:2": "And he said unto them, The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth laborers into his harvest.",

    "Luke 10:4": "Carry no purse, no wallet, no shoes; and salute no man on the way.",
    "Luke 10:5": "And into whatsoever house ye shall enter, first say, Peace be to this house.",
    "Luke 10:6": "And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon him: but if not, it shall turn to you again.",
    "Luke 10:7": "And in that same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.",
    "Luke 10:8": "And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:",
    "Luke 10:9": "and heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.",
    "Luke 10:10": "But into whatsoever city ye shall enter, and they receive you not, go out into the streets thereof and say,",
    "Luke 10:11": "Even the dust from your city, that cleaveth to our feet, we wipe off against you: nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh.",
    "Luke 10:12": "I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.",
    "Luke 10:13": "Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.",
    "Luke 10:14": "But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment, than for you.",
    "Luke 10:15": "And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt be brought down unto Hades.",
    "Luke 10:16": "He that heareth you heareth me; and he that rejecteth you rejecteth me; and he that rejecteth me rejecteth him that sent me.",
    "Luke 10:17": "And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject unto us in thy name.",
    "Luke 10:18": "And he said unto them, I beheld Satan fallen as lightning from heaven.",
    "Luke 10:19": "Behold, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall in any wise hurt you.",
    "Luke 10:20": "Nevertheless in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.",
    "Luke 10:21": "In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding, and didst reveal them unto babes: yea, Father; for so it was well-pleasing in thy sight.",
    "Luke 10:22": "All things have been delivered unto me of my Father: and no one knoweth who the Son is, save the Father; and who the Father is, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal him.",
    "Luke 10:23": "And turning to the disciples, he said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:",
    "Luke 10:24": "for I say unto you, that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.",
    "Luke 10:25": "And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and made trial of him, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?",
    "Luke 10:26": "And he said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?",
    "Luke 10:27": "And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.",
    "Luke 10:28": "And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.",
    "Luke 10:29": "But he, desiring to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbor?",
    "Luke 10:30": "Jesus made answer and said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho; and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.",
    "Luke 10:31": "And by chance a certain priest was going down that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.",
    "Luke 10:32": "And in like manner a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side.",
    "Luke 10:33": "But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion,",
    "Luke 10:34": "and came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on them oil and wine; and he set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.",
    "Luke 10:35": "And on the morrow he took out two shillings, and gave them to the host, and said, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, I, when I come back again, will repay thee.",
    "Luke 10:36": "Which of these three, thinkest thou, proved neighbor unto him that fell among the robbers?",
    "Luke 10:37": "And he said, He that showed mercy on him. And Jesus said unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.",
    "Luke 10:38": "Now as they went on their way, he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.",
    "Luke 10:39": "And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at the Lord’s feet, and heard his word.",
    "Luke 10:40": "But Martha was cumbered about much serving; and she came up to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister did leave me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.",
    "Luke 10:41": "But the Lord answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and troubled about many things:",
    "Luke 10:42": "but one thing is needful: for Mary hath chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her.",
    "Luke 11:1": "And it came to pass, as he was praying in a certain place, that when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples.",
    "Luke 11:2": "And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Father, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.",
    "Luke 11:3": "Give us day by day our daily bread.",
    "Luke 11:4": "And forgive us our sins; for we ourselves also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And bring us not into temptation.",
    "Luke 11:5": "And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;",
    "Luke 11:6": "for a friend of mine is come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him;",
    "Luke 11:7": "and he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee?",
    "Luke 11:8": "I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will arise and give him as many as he needeth.",
    "Luke 11:9": "And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.",
    "Luke 11:10": "For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.",
    "Luke 11:11": "And of which of you that is a father shall his son ask a loaf, and he give him a stone? or a fish, and he for a fish give him a serpent?",
    "Luke 11:12": "Or if he shall ask an egg, will he give him a scorpion?",
    "Luke 11:13": "If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?",
    "Luke 11:14": "And he was casting out a demon that was dumb. And it came to pass, when the demon was gone out, the dumb man spake; and the multitudes marvelled.",
    "Luke 11:15": "But some of them said, By Beelzebub the prince of the demons casteth he out demons.",
    "Luke 11:16": "And others, trying him, sought of him a sign from heaven.",
    "Luke 11:17": "But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth.",
    "Luke 11:18": "And if Satan also is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out demons by Beelzebub.",
    "Luke 11:19": "And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.",

    "Luke 11:26": "Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more evil than himself; and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first.",
    "Luke 11:27": "And it came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the breasts which thou didst suck.",
