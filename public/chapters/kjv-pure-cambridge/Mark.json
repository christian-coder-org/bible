    "Malachi 1:3": "And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.",
    "Malachi 1:4": "Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.",
    "Malachi 1:5": "And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel.",
    "Malachi 1:6": "A son honoureth [his] father, and a servant his master: if then I [be] a father, where [is] mine honour? and if I [be] a master, where [is] my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?",
    "Malachi 1:7": "Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD [is] contemptible.",
    "Malachi 1:8": "And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, [is it] not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, [is it] not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.",

    "Malachi 1:12": "But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD [is] polluted; and the fruit thereof, [even] his meat, [is] contemptible.",

    "Malachi 2:14": "Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet [is] she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.",
    "Malachi 2:15": "And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.",
    "Malachi 2:16": "For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away: for [one] covereth violence with his garment, saith the LORD of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.",

    "Malachi 3:1": "Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.",
    "Malachi 3:2": "But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he [is] like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ soap:",
    "Malachi 3:3": "And he shall sit [as] a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.",

    "Malachi 3:5": "And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in [his] wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger [from his right], and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.",
    "Malachi 3:6": "For I [am] the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.",
    "Malachi 3:7": "Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept [them]. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?",
    "Malachi 3:8": "Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.",
    "Malachi 3:9": "Ye [are] cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, [even] this whole nation.",
    "Malachi 3:10": "Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that [there shall] not [be room] enough [to receive it].",

    "Malachi 3:13": "Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, What have we spoken [so much] against thee?",
    "Malachi 3:14": "Ye have said, It [is] vain to serve God: and what profit [is it] that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hosts?",
    "Malachi 3:15": "And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, [they that] tempt God are even delivered.",
    "Malachi 3:16": "Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard [it], and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.",
    "Malachi 3:17": "And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.",
    "Malachi 3:18": "Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.",
    "Malachi 4:1": "For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.",

    "Mark 4:39": "And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.",
    "Mark 4:40": "And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?",
    "Mark 4:41": "And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?",
    "Mark 5:1": "And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.",
    "Mark 5:2": "And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,",
    "Mark 5:3": "Who had [his] dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:",

    "Mark 5:6": "But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,",
    "Mark 5:7": "And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, [thou] Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.",
    "Mark 5:8": "For he said unto him, Come out of the man, [thou] unclean spirit.",
    "Mark 5:9": "And he asked him, What [is] thy name? And he answered, saying, My name [is] Legion: for we are many.",
    "Mark 5:10": "And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.",
    "Mark 5:11": "Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.",
    "Mark 5:12": "And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.",
    "Mark 5:13": "And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.",
    "Mark 5:14": "And they that fed the swine fled, and told [it] in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.",
    "Mark 5:15": "And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.",

    "Mark 5:24": "And [Jesus] went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.",
    "Mark 5:25": "And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,",
    "Mark 5:26": "And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,",
    "Mark 5:27": "When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.",
    "Mark 5:28": "For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.",

    "Mark 6:16": "But when Herod heard [thereof], he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.",
    "Mark 6:17": "For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife: for he had married her.",
    "Mark 6:18": "For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother’s wife.",
    "Mark 6:19": "Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:",
    "Mark 6:20": "For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.",
    "Mark 6:21": "And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief [estates] of Galilee;",
    "Mark 6:22": "And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give [it] thee.",
    "Mark 6:23": "And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give [it] thee, unto the half of my kingdom.",
    "Mark 6:24": "And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.",
    "Mark 6:25": "And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.",
    "Mark 6:26": "And the king was exceeding sorry; [yet] for his oath’s sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.",
    "Mark 6:27": "And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,",
    "Mark 6:28": "And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.",
    "Mark 6:29": "And when his disciples heard [of it], they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.",
    "Mark 6:30": "And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.",
    "Mark 6:31": "And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.",
    "Mark 6:32": "And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.",
    "Mark 6:33": "And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.",
    "Mark 6:34": "And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.",
    "Mark 6:35": "And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time [is] far passed:",
    "Mark 6:36": "Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.",
    "Mark 6:37": "He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?",
    "Mark 6:38": "He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.",
    "Mark 6:39": "And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.",
    "Mark 6:40": "And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.",
    "Mark 6:41": "And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave [them] to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.",
    "Mark 6:42": "And they did all eat, and were filled.",
    "Mark 6:43": "And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.",
    "Mark 6:44": "And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.",
    "Mark 6:45": "And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.",
    "Mark 6:46": "And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.",
    "Mark 6:47": "And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.",
    "Mark 6:48": "And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.",
    "Mark 6:49": "But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:",
    "Mark 6:50": "For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.",
    "Mark 6:51": "And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.",
    "Mark 6:52": "For they considered not [the miracle] of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.",
    "Mark 6:53": "And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.",
    "Mark 6:54": "And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,",
    "Mark 6:55": "And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.",
    "Mark 6:56": "And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.",
    "Mark 7:1": "Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.",
    "Mark 7:2": "And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.",
    "Mark 7:3": "For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash [their] hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.",
    "Mark 7:4": "And [when they come] from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, [as] the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.",
    "Mark 7:5": "Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?",
    "Mark 7:6": "He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with [their] lips, but their heart is far from me.",
    "Mark 7:7": "Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching [for] doctrines the commandments of men.",
    "Mark 7:8": "For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, [as] the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.",
    "Mark 7:9": "And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.",
    "Mark 7:10": "For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:",
    "Mark 7:11": "But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, [It is] Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; [he shall be free].",
    "Mark 7:12": "And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;",
    "Mark 7:13": "Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.",
    "Mark 7:14": "And when he had called all the people [unto him], he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one [of you], and understand:",
    "Mark 7:15": "There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.",
    "Mark 7:16": "If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.",
    "Mark 7:17": "And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.",
    "Mark 7:18": "And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, [it] cannot defile him;",
    "Mark 7:19": "Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?",
    "Mark 7:20": "And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.",
    "Mark 7:21": "For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,",
    "Mark 7:22": "Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:",
    "Mark 7:23": "All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.",
    "Mark 7:24": "And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know [it]: but he could not be hid.",
    "Mark 7:25": "For a [certain] woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:",
    "Mark 7:26": "The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.",
    "Mark 7:27": "But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast [it] unto the dogs.",
    "Mark 7:28": "And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.",
    "Mark 7:29": "And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.",
    "Mark 7:30": "And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.",
    "Mark 7:31": "And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.",
    "Mark 7:32": "And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.",
    "Mark 7:33": "And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;",
    "Mark 7:34": "And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.",
    "Mark 7:35": "And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.",
    "Mark 7:36": "And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published [it];",
    "Mark 7:37": "And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.",
    "Mark 8:1": "In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples [unto him], and saith unto them,",
    "Mark 8:2": "I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:",
    "Mark 8:3": "And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.",
    "Mark 8:4": "And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these [men] with bread here in the wilderness?",
    "Mark 8:5": "And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.",
    "Mark 8:6": "And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before [them]; and they did set [them] before the people.",
    "Mark 8:7": "And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before [them].",
    "Mark 8:8": "So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken [meat] that was left seven baskets.",
    "Mark 8:9": "And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.",
    "Mark 8:10": "And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.",
    "Mark 8:11": "And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.",
    "Mark 8:12": "And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.",
    "Mark 8:13": "And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.",
    "Mark 8:14": "Now [the disciples] had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.",
    "Mark 8:15": "And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and [of] the leaven of Herod.",
    "Mark 8:16": "And they reasoned among themselves, saying, [It is] because we have no bread.",
    "Mark 8:17": "And when Jesus knew [it], he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?",
    "Mark 8:18": "Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?",
    "Mark 8:19": "When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.",
    "Mark 8:20": "And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.",
    "Mark 8:21": "And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?",
    "Mark 8:22": "And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.",
    "Mark 8:23": "And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.",
    "Mark 8:24": "And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.",
    "Mark 8:25": "After that he put [his] hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.",
    "Mark 8:26": "And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell [it] to any in the town.",
    "Mark 8:27": "And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?",
    "Mark 8:28": "And they answered, John the Baptist: but some [say], Elias; and others, One of the prophets.",
    "Mark 8:29": "And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.",
    "Mark 8:30": "And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.",
    "Mark 8:31": "And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and [of] the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.",
    "Mark 8:32": "And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.",
    "Mark 8:33": "But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.",
    "Mark 8:34": "And when he had called the people [unto him] with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.",
    "Mark 8:35": "For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, the same shall save it.",
    "Mark 8:36": "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?",
    "Mark 8:37": "Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?",
    "Mark 8:38": "Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.",
    "Mark 9:1": "And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.",
    "Mark 9:2": "And after six days Jesus taketh [with him] Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.",
    "Mark 9:3": "And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them.",
    "Mark 9:4": "And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.",
    "Mark 9:5": "And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.",
    "Mark 9:6": "For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.",
    "Mark 9:7": "And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.",
    "Mark 9:8": "And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.",
    "Mark 9:9": "And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.",
    "Mark 9:10": "And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean.",
    "Mark 9:11": "And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come?",
    "Mark 9:12": "And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.",
    "Mark 9:13": "But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.",
    "Mark 9:14": "And when he came to [his] disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them.",
    "Mark 9:15": "And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to [him] saluted him.",
    "Mark 9:16": "And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?",
    "Mark 9:17": "And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;",
    "Mark 9:18": "And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not.",
    "Mark 9:19": "He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.",
    "Mark 9:20": "And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.",
    "Mark 9:21": "And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child.",
    "Mark 9:22": "And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.",
    "Mark 9:23": "Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things [are] possible to him that believeth.",
    "Mark 9:24": "And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.",
    "Mark 9:25": "When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, [Thou] dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.",
    "Mark 9:26": "And [the spirit] cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.",
    "Mark 9:27": "But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.",
    "Mark 9:28": "And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?",
    "Mark 9:29": "And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.",
    "Mark 9:30": "And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know [it].",
    "Mark 9:31": "For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.",
    "Mark 9:32": "But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.",
    "Mark 9:33": "And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?",
    "Mark 9:34": "But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who [should be] the greatest.",
    "Mark 9:35": "And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, [the same] shall be last of all, and servant of all.",
    "Mark 9:36": "And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,",

    "Mark 9:40": "For he that is not against us is on our part.",
    "Mark 9:41": "For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.",
    "Mark 9:42": "And whosoever shall offend one of [these] little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.",
    "Mark 9:43": "And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:",
    "Mark 9:44": "Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.",
    "Mark 9:45": "And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:",
