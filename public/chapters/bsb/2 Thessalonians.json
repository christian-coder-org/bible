    "Malachi 1:1": "This is the burden of the word of the LORD to Israel through Malachi:",
    "Malachi 1:2": "“I have loved you,” says the LORD. But you ask, “How have You loved us?” “Was not Esau Jacob’s brother?” declares the LORD. “Yet Jacob I have loved,",
    "Malachi 1:3": "but Esau I have hated, and I have made his mountains a wasteland and left his inheritance to the desert jackals.”",
    "Malachi 1:4": "Though Edom may say, “We have been devastated, but we will rebuild the ruins,” this is what the LORD of Hosts says: “They may build, but I will demolish. They will be called the Land of Wickedness, and a people with whom the LORD is indignant forever.",
    "Malachi 1:5": "You will see this with your own eyes, and you yourselves will say, ‘The LORD is great—even beyond the borders of Israel.’”",
    "Malachi 1:6": "“A son honors his father, and a servant his master. But if I am a father, where is My honor? And if I am a master, where is your fear of Me?” says the LORD of Hosts to you priests who despise My name. “But you ask, ‘How have we despised Your name?’",
    "Malachi 1:7": "By presenting defiled food on My altar. But you ask, ‘How have we defiled You?’ By saying that the table of the LORD is contemptible.",
    "Malachi 1:8": "When you offer blind animals for sacrifice, is it not wrong? And when you present the lame and sick ones, is it not wrong? Try offering them to your governor! Would he be pleased with you or show you favor?” asks the LORD of Hosts.",
    "Malachi 1:9": "“But ask now for God’s favor. Will He be gracious? Since this has come from your hands, will He show you favor?” asks the LORD of Hosts.",
    "Malachi 1:10": "“Oh, that one of you would shut the temple doors, so that you would no longer kindle useless fires on My altar! I take no pleasure in you,” says the LORD of Hosts, “and I will accept no offering from your hands.",
    "Malachi 1:11": "For My name will be great among the nations, from where the sun rises to where it sets. In every place, incense and pure offerings will be presented in My name, because My name will be great among the nations,” says the LORD of Hosts.",
    "Malachi 1:12": "“But you profane it when you say, ‘The table of the Lord is defiled, and as for its fruit, its food is contemptible.’",
    "Malachi 1:13": "You also say: ‘Oh, what a nuisance!’ And you turn up your nose at it,” says the LORD of Hosts. “You bring offerings that are stolen, lame, or sick! Should I accept these from your hands?” asks the LORD.",
    "Malachi 1:14": "“But cursed is the deceiver who has an acceptable male in his flock and vows to give it, but sacrifices a defective animal to the Lord. For I am a great King,” says the LORD of Hosts, “and My name is to be feared among the nations.",
    "Malachi 2:1": "“And now this decree is for you, O priests:",
    "Malachi 2:2": "If you do not listen, and if you do not take it to heart to honor My name,” says the LORD of Hosts, “I will send a curse among you, and I will curse your blessings. Yes, I have already begun to curse them, because you are not taking it to heart.",
    "Malachi 2:3": "Behold, I will rebuke your descendants, and I will spread dung on your faces, the waste from your feasts, and you will be carried off with it.",
    "Malachi 2:4": "Then you will know that I have sent you this commandment so that My covenant with Levi may continue,” says the LORD of Hosts.",
    "Malachi 2:5": "“My covenant with him was one of life and peace, which I gave to him; it called for reverence, and he revered Me and stood in awe of My name.",
    "Malachi 2:6": "True instruction was in his mouth, and nothing false was found on his lips. He walked with Me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity.",
    "Malachi 2:7": "For the lips of a priest should preserve knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, because he is the messenger of the LORD of Hosts.",
    "Malachi 2:8": "But you have departed from the way, and your instruction has caused many to stumble. You have violated the covenant of Levi,” says the LORD of Hosts.",
    "Malachi 2:9": "“So I in turn have made you despised and humiliated before all the people, because you have not kept My ways, but have shown partiality in matters of the law.”",
    "Malachi 2:10": "Do we not all have one Father? Did not one God create us? Why then do we break faith with one another so as to profane the covenant of our fathers?",
    "Malachi 2:11": "Judah has broken faith; an abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Judah has profaned the LORD’s beloved sanctuary by marrying the daughter of a foreign god.",
    "Malachi 2:12": "As for the man who does this, may the LORD cut off from the tents of Jacob everyone who is awake and aware—even if he brings an offering to the LORD of Hosts.",
    "Malachi 2:13": "And this is another thing you do: You cover the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping and groaning, because He no longer regards your offerings or receives them gladly from your hands.",
    "Malachi 2:14": "Yet you ask, “Why?” It is because the LORD has been a witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have broken faith, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant.",
    "Malachi 2:15": "Has not the LORD made them one, having a portion of the Spirit? And why one? Because He seeks godly offspring. So guard yourselves in your spirit and do not break faith with the wife of your youth.",
    "Malachi 2:16": "“For I hate divorce,” says the LORD, the God of Israel. “He who divorces his wife covers his garment with violence,” says the LORD of Hosts. So guard yourselves in your spirit and do not break faith.",
    "Malachi 2:17": "You have wearied the LORD with your words; yet you ask, “How have we wearied Him?” By saying, “All who do evil are good in the sight of the LORD, and in them He delights,” or, “Where is the God of justice?”",
    "Malachi 3:1": "“Behold, I will send My messenger, who will prepare the way before Me. Then the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to His temple—the Messenger of the covenant, in whom you delight—see, He is coming,” says the LORD of Hosts.",
    "Malachi 3:2": "But who can endure the day of His coming? And who can stand when He appears? For He will be like a refiner’s fire, like a launderer’s soap.",
    "Malachi 3:3": "And He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; He will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver. Then they will present offerings to the LORD in righteousness.",
    "Malachi 3:4": "Then the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will please the LORD, as in days of old and years gone by.",
    "Malachi 3:5": "“Then I will draw near to you for judgment. And I will be a swift witness against sorcerers and adulterers and perjurers, against oppressors of the widowed and fatherless, and against those who defraud laborers of their wages and deny justice to the foreigner but do not fear Me,” says the LORD of Hosts.",
    "Malachi 3:6": "“Because I, the LORD, do not change, you descendants of Jacob have not been destroyed.",
    "Malachi 3:7": "Yet from the days of your fathers, you have turned away from My statutes and have not kept them. Return to Me, and I will return to you,” says the LORD of Hosts. “But you ask, ‘How can we return?’",
    "Malachi 3:8": "Will a man rob God? Yet you are robbing Me! But you ask, ‘How do we rob You?’ In tithes and offerings.",
    "Malachi 3:9": "You are cursed with a curse, yet you—the whole nation—are still robbing Me.",
    "Malachi 3:10": "Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, so that there may be food in My house. Test Me in this,” says the LORD of Hosts. “See if I will not open the windows of heaven and pour out for you blessing without measure.",
    "Malachi 3:11": "I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that it will not destroy the fruits of your land, and the vine in your field will not fail to produce fruit,” says the LORD of Hosts.",
    "Malachi 3:12": "“Then all the nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delight,” says the LORD of Hosts.",
    "Malachi 3:13": "“Your words against Me have been harsh,” says the LORD. “Yet you ask, ‘What have we spoken against You?’",
    "Malachi 3:14": "You have said, ‘It is futile to serve God. What have we gained by keeping His requirements and walking mournfully before the LORD of Hosts?",
    "Malachi 3:15": "So now we call the arrogant blessed. Not only do evildoers prosper, they even test God and escape.’”",
    "Malachi 3:16": "At that time those who feared the LORD spoke with one another, and the LORD listened and heard them. So a scroll of remembrance was written before Him regarding those who feared the LORD and honored His name.",
    "Malachi 3:17": "“They will be Mine,” says the LORD of Hosts, “on the day when I prepare My treasured possession. And I will spare them as a man spares his own son who serves him.",
    "Malachi 3:18": "So you will again distinguish between the righteous and the wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not.”",
    "Malachi 4:1": "“For behold, the day is coming, burning like a furnace, when all the arrogant and every evildoer will be stubble; the day is coming when I will set them ablaze,” says the LORD of Hosts. “Not a root or branch will be left to them.”",
    "Malachi 4:2": "“But for you who fear My name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings, and you will go out and leap like calves from the stall.",
    "Malachi 4:3": "Then you will trample the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day I am preparing,” says the LORD of Hosts.",
    "Malachi 4:4": "“Remember the law of My servant Moses, the statutes and ordinances I commanded him for all Israel at Horeb.",
    "Malachi 4:5": "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and awesome Day of the LORD.",
    "Malachi 4:6": "And he will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers. Otherwise, I will come and strike the land with a curse.”",
    "Matthew 1:1": "This is the record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:",
    "Matthew 1:2": "Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers.",

    "Matthew 1:18": "This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged in marriage to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.",
    "Matthew 1:19": "Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and was unwilling to disgrace her publicly, he resolved to divorce her quietly.",
    "Matthew 1:20": "But after he had pondered these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to embrace Mary as your wife, for the One conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.",
    "Matthew 1:21": "She will give birth to a Son, and you are to give Him the name Jesus, because He will save His people from their sins.”",

    "Matthew 13:31": "He put before them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and planted in his field.",
    "Matthew 13:32": "Although it is the smallest of all seeds, yet it grows into the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.”",
    "Matthew 13:33": "He told them still another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour, until all of it was leavened.”",
    "Matthew 13:34": "Jesus spoke all these things to the crowds in parables. He did not tell them anything without using a parable.",
    "Matthew 13:35": "So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: “I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world.”",
    "Matthew 13:36": "Then Jesus dismissed the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to Him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.”",
    "Matthew 13:37": "He replied, “The One who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.",
    "Matthew 13:38": "The field is the world, and the good seed represents the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one,",
    "Matthew 13:39": "and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.",
    "Matthew 13:40": "As the weeds are collected and burned in the fire, so will it be at the end of the age.",
    "Matthew 13:41": "The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will weed out of His kingdom every cause of sin and all who practice lawlessness.",
    "Matthew 13:42": "And they will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.",
    "Matthew 13:43": "Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.",
    "Matthew 13:44": "The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and in his joy he went and sold all he had and bought that field.",
    "Matthew 13:45": "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.",
    "Matthew 13:46": "When he found one very precious pearl, he went away and sold all he had and bought it.",
    "Matthew 13:47": "Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea and caught all kinds of fish.",
    "Matthew 13:48": "When it was full, the men pulled it ashore. Then they sat down and sorted the good fish into containers, but threw the bad away.",
    "Matthew 13:49": "So will it be at the end of the age: The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous",

    "Matthew 14:18": "“Bring them here to Me,” Jesus said.",
    "Matthew 14:19": "And He directed the crowds to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, He spoke a blessing. Then He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.",
    "Matthew 14:20": "They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.",
    "Matthew 14:21": "About five thousand men were fed, besides women and children.",
    "Matthew 14:22": "Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of Him to the other side, while He dismissed the crowds.",
    "Matthew 14:23": "After He had dismissed them, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. When evening came, He was there alone,",
    "Matthew 14:24": "but the boat was already far from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.",
    "Matthew 14:25": "During the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went out to them, walking on the sea.",
    "Matthew 14:26": "When the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost!” they said, and cried out in fear.",
    "Matthew 14:27": "But Jesus spoke up at once: “Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.”",
    "Matthew 14:28": "“Lord, if it is You,” Peter replied, “command me to come to You on the water.”",

    "Matthew 15:3": "Jesus replied, “And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?",
    "Matthew 15:4": "For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother’ and ‘Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.’",

    "Matthew 26:41": "“Watch and pray so that you will not enter into temptation. For the spirit is willing, but the body is weak.”",
    "Matthew 26:42": "A second time He went away and prayed, “My Father, if this cup cannot pass unless I drink it, may Your will be done.”",
    "Matthew 26:43": "And again Jesus returned and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.",
    "Matthew 26:44": "So He left them and went away once more and prayed a third time, saying the same thing.",
    "Matthew 26:45": "Then He returned to the disciples and said, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.",
    "Matthew 26:46": "Rise, let us go! See, My betrayer is approaching!”",
    "Matthew 26:47": "While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, accompanied by a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and elders of the people.",
    "Matthew 26:48": "Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The One I kiss is the man; arrest Him.”",
    "Matthew 26:49": "Going directly to Jesus, he said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed Him.",
    "Matthew 26:50": "“Friend,” Jesus replied, “do what you came for.” Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested Him.",
    "Matthew 26:51": "At this, one of Jesus’ companions drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.",
    "Matthew 26:52": "“Put your sword back in its place,” Jesus said to him. “For all who draw the sword will die by the sword.",
    "Matthew 26:53": "Are you not aware that I can call on My Father, and He will at once put at My disposal more than twelve legions of angels?",
    "Matthew 26:54": "But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen this way?”",
    "Matthew 26:55": "At that time Jesus said to the crowd, “Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me as you would an outlaw? Every day I sat teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest Me.",
    "Matthew 26:56": "But this has all happened so that the writings of the prophets would be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples deserted Him and fled.",
    "Matthew 26:57": "Those who had arrested Jesus led Him away to the house of Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and elders had gathered.",
    "Matthew 26:58": "But Peter followed Him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. And he went in and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.",
    "Matthew 26:59": "Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking false testimony against Jesus in order to put Him to death.",
    "Matthew 26:60": "But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally two came forward",
    "Matthew 26:61": "and declared, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’”",
    "Matthew 26:62": "So the high priest stood up and asked Him, “Have You no answer? What are these men testifying against You?”",
    "Matthew 26:63": "But Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest said to Him, “I charge You under oath by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God.”",
    "Matthew 26:64": "“You have said it yourself,” Jesus answered. “But I say to all of you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.”",
    "Matthew 26:65": "At this, the high priest tore his clothes and declared, “He has blasphemed! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy.",
    "Matthew 26:66": "What do you think?” “He deserves to die,” they answered.",
    "Matthew 26:67": "Then they spit in His face and struck Him. Others slapped Him",
    "Matthew 26:68": "and said, “Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit You?”",
    "Matthew 26:69": "Meanwhile, Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came up to him. “You also were with Jesus the Galilean,” she said.",
    "Matthew 26:70": "But he denied it before them all: “I do not know what you are talking about.”",
    "Matthew 26:71": "When Peter had gone out to the gateway, another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.”",
    "Matthew 26:72": "And again he denied it with an oath: “I do not know the man!”",
    "Matthew 26:73": "After a little while, those standing nearby came up to Peter. “Surely you are one of them,” they said, “for your accent gives you away.”",
    "Matthew 26:74": "At that he began to curse and swear to them, “I do not know the man!” And immediately a rooster crowed.",
    "Matthew 26:75": "Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken: “Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly.",
    "Matthew 27:1": "When morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people conspired against Jesus to put Him to death.",
    "Matthew 27:2": "They bound Him, led Him away, and handed Him over to Pilate the governor.",
    "Matthew 27:3": "When Judas, who had betrayed Him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was filled with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.",
    "Matthew 27:4": "“I have sinned by betraying innocent blood,” he said. “What is that to us?” they replied. “You bear the responsibility.”",
    "Matthew 27:5": "So Judas threw the silver into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.",
    "Matthew 27:6": "The chief priests picked up the pieces of silver and said, “It is unlawful to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.”",
    "Matthew 27:7": "After conferring together, they used the money to buy the potter’s field as a burial place for foreigners.",
    "Matthew 27:8": "That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day.",
    "Matthew 27:9": "Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: “They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on Him by the people of Israel,",
    "Matthew 27:10": "and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord had commanded me.”",
    "Matthew 27:11": "Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, who questioned Him: “Are You the King of the Jews?” “You have said so,” Jesus replied.",
    "Matthew 27:12": "And when He was accused by the chief priests and elders, He gave no answer.",
    "Matthew 27:13": "Then Pilate asked Him, “Do You not hear how many charges they are bringing against You?”",
    "Matthew 27:14": "But Jesus gave no answer, not even to a single charge, much to the governor’s amazement.",
    "Matthew 27:15": "Now it was the governor’s custom at the feast to release to the crowd a prisoner of their choosing.",
    "Matthew 27:16": "At that time they were holding a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.",
    "Matthew 27:17": "So when the crowd had assembled, Pilate asked them, “Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?”",
    "Matthew 27:18": "For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him.",
    "Matthew 27:19": "While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him this message: “Have nothing to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered terribly in a dream today because of Him.”",
    "Matthew 27:20": "But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus put to death.",
    "Matthew 27:21": "“Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” asked the governor. “Barabbas,” they replied.",
    "Matthew 27:22": "“What then should I do with Jesus who is called Christ?” Pilate asked. They all answered, “Crucify Him!”",
    "Matthew 27:23": "“Why?” asked Pilate. “What evil has He done?” But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify Him!”",
    "Matthew 27:24": "When Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but that instead a riot was breaking out, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd. “I am innocent of this man’s blood,” he said. “You bear the responsibility.”",
    "Matthew 27:25": "All the people answered, “His blood be on us and on our children!”",
    "Matthew 27:26": "So Pilate released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed Him over to be crucified.",
    "Matthew 27:27": "Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company around Him.",
    "Matthew 27:28": "They stripped Him and put a scarlet robe on Him.",
    "Matthew 27:29": "And they twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on His head. They put a staff in His right hand, knelt down before Him, and mocked Him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”",
    "Matthew 27:30": "Then they spit on Him and took the staff and struck Him on the head repeatedly.",
    "Matthew 27:31": "After they had mocked Him, they removed the robe and put His own clothes back on Him. Then they led Him away to crucify Him.",
    "Matthew 27:32": "Along the way they found a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross of Jesus.",
    "Matthew 27:33": "And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means The Place of the Skull,",
    "Matthew 27:34": "they offered Him wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, He refused to drink it.",
    "Matthew 27:35": "When they had crucified Him, they divided up His garments by casting lots.",
    "Matthew 27:36": "And sitting down, they kept watch over Him there.",
    "Matthew 27:37": "Above His head they posted the written charge against Him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.",
    "Matthew 27:38": "Two robbers were crucified with Him, one on His right and the other on His left.",
    "Matthew 27:39": "And those who passed by heaped abuse on Him, shaking their heads",
    "Matthew 27:40": "and saying, “You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross!”",
    "Matthew 27:41": "In the same way, the chief priests, scribes, and elders mocked Him, saying,",
    "Matthew 27:42": "“He saved others, but He cannot save Himself. He is the King of Israel! Let Him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in Him.",
    "Matthew 27:43": "He trusts in God. Let God deliver Him now if He wants Him. For He said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”",
    "Matthew 27:44": "In the same way, even the robbers who were crucified with Him berated Him.",
    "Matthew 27:45": "From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.",
    "Matthew 27:46": "About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” which means, “My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?”",
    "Matthew 27:47": "When some of those standing there heard this, they said, “He is calling Elijah.”",
    "Matthew 27:48": "One of them quickly ran and brought a sponge. He filled it with sour wine, put it on a reed, and held it up for Jesus to drink.",
    "Matthew 27:49": "But the others said, “Leave Him alone. Let us see if Elijah comes to save Him.”",
    "Matthew 27:50": "When Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, He yielded up His spirit.",
    "Matthew 27:51": "At that moment the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth quaked, and the rocks were split.",

    "Matthew 27:53": "After Jesus’ resurrection, when they had come out of the tombs, they entered the holy city and appeared to many people.",
    "Matthew 27:54": "When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified and said, “Truly this was the Son of God.”",
    "Matthew 27:55": "And many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to minister to Him.",
    "Matthew 27:56": "Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons.",
    "Matthew 27:57": "When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, who himself was a disciple of Jesus.",
    "Matthew 27:58": "He went to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him.",
    "Matthew 27:59": "So Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,",
    "Matthew 27:60": "and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut into the rock. Then he rolled a great stone across the entrance to the tomb and went away.",
    "Matthew 27:61": "Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.",
    "Matthew 27:62": "The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and Pharisees assembled before Pilate.",
    "Matthew 27:63": "“Sir,” they said, “we remember that while He was alive that deceiver said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’",
    "Matthew 27:64": "So give the order that the tomb be secured until the third day. Otherwise, His disciples may come and steal Him away and tell the people He has risen from the dead. And this last deception would be worse than the first.”",
    "Matthew 27:65": "“You have a guard,” Pilate said. “Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how.”",
    "Matthew 27:66": "So they went and secured the tomb by sealing the stone and posting the guard.",
    "Matthew 28:1": "After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.",
    "Matthew 28:2": "Suddenly there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, rolled away the stone, and sat on it.",
    "Matthew 28:3": "His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.",
    "Matthew 28:4": "The guards trembled in fear of him and became like dead men.",
    "Matthew 28:5": "But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.",
    "Matthew 28:6": "He is not here; He has risen, just as He said! Come, see the place where He lay.",
    "Matthew 28:7": "Then go quickly and tell His disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see Him.’ See, I have told you.”",
    "Matthew 28:8": "So they hurried away from the tomb in fear and great joy, and ran to tell His disciples.",
    "Matthew 28:9": "Suddenly Jesus met them and said, “Greetings!” They came to Him, grasped His feet, and worshiped Him.",
    "Matthew 28:10": "“Do not be afraid,” said Jesus. “Go and tell My brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see Me.”",
    "Matthew 28:11": "While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened.",
    "Matthew 28:12": "And after the chief priests had met with the elders and formed a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money",
    "Matthew 28:13": "and instructed them: “You are to say, ‘His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.’",
    "Matthew 28:14": "If this report reaches the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.”",
    "Matthew 28:15": "So the guards took the money and did as they were instructed. And this account has been circulated among the Jews to this very day.",
    "Matthew 28:16": "Meanwhile, the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain Jesus had designated.",
    "Matthew 28:17": "When they saw Him, they worshiped Him, but some doubted.",
    "Matthew 28:18": "Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me.",
    "Matthew 28:19": "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,",

    "Mark 1:12": "At once the Spirit drove Jesus into the wilderness,",
    "Mark 1:13": "and He was there for forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels ministered to Him.",
    "Mark 1:14": "After the arrest of John, Jesus went into Galilee and proclaimed the gospel of God.",
    "Mark 1:15": "“The time is fulfilled,” He said, “and the kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe in the gospel!”",
    "Mark 1:16": "As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.",
    "Mark 1:17": "“Come, follow Me,” Jesus said, “and I will make you fishers of men.”",
    "Mark 1:18": "And at once they left their nets and followed Him.",
    "Mark 1:19": "Going on a little farther, He saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat, mending their nets.",
    "Mark 1:20": "Immediately Jesus called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed Him.",
    "Mark 1:21": "Then Jesus and His companions went to Capernaum, and right away Jesus entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and began to teach.",
    "Mark 1:22": "The people were astonished at His teaching, because He taught as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.",
    "Mark 1:23": "Suddenly a man with an unclean spirit cried out in the synagogue:",
    "Mark 1:24": "“What do You want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!”",
    "Mark 1:25": "But Jesus rebuked the spirit. “Be silent!” He said. “Come out of him!”",
    "Mark 1:26": "At this, the unclean spirit threw the man into convulsions and came out with a loud shriek.",
    "Mark 1:27": "All the people were amazed and began to ask one another, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him!”",

    "Mark 1:32": "That evening, after sunset, people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed,",
    "Mark 1:33": "and the whole town gathered at the door.",

    "Mark 1:45": "But the man went out and openly began to proclaim and spread the news. Consequently, Jesus could no longer enter a town in plain view, but He stayed out in solitary places. Yet people came to Him from every quarter.",
    "Mark 2:1": "A few days later Jesus went back to Capernaum. And when the people heard that He was home,",
    "Mark 2:2": "they gathered in such large numbers that there was no more room, not even outside the door, as Jesus spoke the word to them.",
    "Mark 2:3": "Then a paralytic was brought to Him, carried by four men.",
    "Mark 2:4": "Since they were unable to get to Jesus through the crowd, they uncovered the roof above Him, made an opening, and lowered the paralytic on his mat.",
    "Mark 2:5": "When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”",
    "Mark 2:6": "But some of the scribes were sitting there and thinking in their hearts,",
    "Mark 2:7": "“Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?”",
    "Mark 2:8": "At once Jesus knew in His spirit that they were thinking this way within themselves. “Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?” He asked.",
    "Mark 2:9": "“Which is easier: to say to a paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, pick up your mat, and walk’?",
    "Mark 2:10": "But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...” He said to the paralytic,",
    "Mark 2:11": "“I tell you, get up, pick up your mat, and go home.”",
    "Mark 2:12": "And immediately the man got up, picked up his mat, and walked out in front of them all. As a result, they were all astounded and glorified God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”",
    "Mark 2:13": "Once again Jesus went out beside the sea. All the people came to Him, and He taught them there.",
    "Mark 2:14": "As He was walking along, He saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth. “Follow Me,” He told him, and Levi got up and followed Him.",
    "Mark 2:15": "While Jesus was dining at Levi’s house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with Him and His disciples—for there were many who followed Him.",
    "Mark 2:16": "When the scribes who were Pharisees saw Jesus eating with these people, they asked His disciples, “Why does He eat with tax collectors and sinners?”",
    "Mark 2:17": "On hearing this, Jesus told them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”",
    "Mark 2:18": "Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were often fasting. So people came to Jesus and asked, “Why don’t Your disciples fast like John’s disciples and those of the Pharisees?”",
    "Mark 2:19": "Jesus replied, “How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while He is with them? As long as He is with them, they cannot fast.",
    "Mark 2:20": "But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast.",
    "Mark 2:21": "No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the new piece will pull away from the old, and a worse tear will result.",
    "Mark 2:22": "And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. Instead, new wine is poured into new wineskins.”",

    "Mark 2:27": "Then Jesus declared, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.",
    "Mark 2:28": "Therefore, the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”",
    "Mark 3:1": "Once again Jesus entered the synagogue, and a man with a withered hand was there.",
    "Mark 3:2": "In order to accuse Jesus, they were watching to see if He would heal on the Sabbath.",
    "Mark 3:3": "Then Jesus said to the man with the withered hand, “Stand up among us.”",
    "Mark 3:4": "And He asked them, “Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?” But they were silent.",
    "Mark 3:5": "Jesus looked around at them with anger and sorrow at their hardness of heart. Then He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” So he stretched it out, and it was restored.",
    "Mark 3:6": "At this, the Pharisees went out and began plotting with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.",
    "Mark 3:7": "So Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea, accompanied by a large crowd from Galilee, Judea,",
    "Mark 3:8": "Jerusalem, Idumea, the region beyond the Jordan, and the vicinity of Tyre and Sidon. The large crowd came to Him when they heard what great things He was doing.",
    "Mark 3:9": "Jesus asked His disciples to have a boat ready for Him so that the crowd would not crush Him.",
    "Mark 3:10": "For He had healed so many that all who had diseases were pressing forward to touch Him.",

    "Mark 3:12": "But He warned them sternly not to make Him known.",
    "Mark 3:13": "Then Jesus went up on the mountain and called for those He wanted, and they came to Him.",
    "Mark 3:14": "He appointed twelve of them, whom He designated as apostles, to accompany Him, to be sent out to preach,",
    "Mark 3:15": "and to have authority to drive out demons.",
    "Mark 3:16": "These are the twelve He appointed: Simon (whom He named Peter),",
    "Mark 3:17": "James son of Zebedee and his brother John (whom He named Boanerges, meaning “Sons of Thunder”),",
    "Mark 3:18": "Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot,",
    "Mark 3:19": "and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus.",
    "Mark 3:20": "Then Jesus went home, and once again a crowd gathered, so that He and His disciples could not even eat.",
    "Mark 3:21": "When His family heard about this, they went out to take custody of Him, saying, “He is out of His mind.”",
    "Mark 3:22": "And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem were saying, “He is possessed by Beelzebul,” and, “By the prince of the demons He drives out demons.”",
    "Mark 3:23": "So Jesus called them together and began to speak to them in parables: “How can Satan drive out Satan?",
    "Mark 3:24": "If a kingdom is divided against itself, it cannot stand.",
    "Mark 3:25": "If a house is divided against itself, it cannot stand.",
    "Mark 3:26": "And if Satan is divided and rises against himself, he cannot stand; his end has come.",
    "Mark 3:27": "Indeed, no one can enter a strong man’s house to steal his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can plunder his house.",
    "Mark 3:28": "Truly I tell you, the sons of men will be forgiven all sins and blasphemies, as many as they utter.",
    "Mark 3:29": "But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of eternal sin.”",
    "Mark 3:30": "Jesus made this statement because they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”",
    "Mark 3:31": "Then Jesus’ mother and brothers came and stood outside. They sent someone in to summon Him,",
    "Mark 3:32": "and a crowd was sitting around Him. “Look,” He was told, “Your mother and brothers are outside, asking for You.”",
    "Mark 3:33": "But Jesus replied, “Who are My mother and My brothers?”",
    "Mark 3:34": "Looking at those seated in a circle around Him, He said, “Here are My mother and My brothers!",
    "Mark 3:35": "For whoever does the will of God is My brother and sister and mother.”",
    "Mark 4:1": "Once again Jesus began to teach beside the sea, and such a large crowd gathered around Him that He got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people crowded along the shore.",
    "Mark 4:2": "And He taught them many things in parables, and in His teaching He said,",
    "Mark 4:3": "“Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed.",
    "Mark 4:4": "And as he was sowing, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.",
    "Mark 4:5": "Some fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow.",
    "Mark 4:6": "But when the sun rose, the seedlings were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.",
    "Mark 4:7": "Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the seedlings, and they yielded no crop.",
    "Mark 4:8": "Still other seed fell on good soil, where it sprouted, grew up, and produced a crop—one bearing thirtyfold, another sixtyfold, and another a hundredfold.”",
    "Mark 4:9": "Then Jesus said, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”",
    "Mark 4:10": "As soon as Jesus was alone with the Twelve and those around Him, they asked Him about the parable.",
    "Mark 4:11": "He replied, “The mystery of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to those on the outside everything is expressed in parables,",
    "Mark 4:12": "so that, ‘they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven.’”",
    "Mark 4:13": "Then Jesus said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? Then how will you understand any of the parables?",
    "Mark 4:14": "The farmer sows the word.",
    "Mark 4:15": "Some are like the seeds along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.",
    "Mark 4:16": "Some are like the seeds sown on rocky ground. They hear the word and at once receive it with joy.",
    "Mark 4:17": "But they themselves have no root, and they remain for only a season. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.",
    "Mark 4:18": "Others are like the seeds sown among the thorns. They hear the word,",
    "Mark 4:19": "but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth, and the desire for other things come in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.",
    "Mark 4:20": "Still others are like the seeds sown on good soil. They hear the word, receive it, and produce a crop—thirtyfold, sixtyfold, or a hundredfold.”",
    "Mark 4:21": "Jesus also said to them, “Does anyone bring in a lamp to put it under a basket or under a bed? Doesn’t he set it on a stand?",
    "Mark 4:22": "For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be brought to light.",
    "Mark 4:23": "If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.”",
    "Mark 4:24": "He went on to say, “Pay attention to what you hear. With the measure you use, it will be measured to you, and even more will be added to you.",
    "Mark 4:25": "For whoever has will be given more. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.”",
    "Mark 4:26": "Jesus also said, “The kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seed on the ground.",
    "Mark 4:27": "Night and day he sleeps and wakes, and the seed sprouts and grows, though he knows not how.",
    "Mark 4:28": "All by itself the earth produces a crop—first the stalk, then the head, then grain that ripens within.",
    "Mark 4:29": "And as soon as the grain is ripe, he swings the sickle, because the harvest has come.”",
    "Mark 4:30": "Then He asked, “To what can we compare the kingdom of God? With what parable shall we present it?",
    "Mark 4:31": "It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds sown upon the earth.",
    "Mark 4:32": "But after it is planted, it grows to be the largest of all garden plants and puts forth great branches, so that the birds of the air nest in its shade.”",
    "Mark 4:33": "With many such parables Jesus spoke the word to them, to the extent that they could understand.",
    "Mark 4:34": "He did not tell them anything without using a parable. But privately He explained everything to His own disciples.",
    "Mark 4:35": "When that evening came, He said to His disciples, “Let us cross to the other side.”",
    "Mark 4:36": "After they had dismissed the crowd, they took Jesus with them, since He was already in the boat. And there were other boats with Him.",
    "Mark 4:37": "Soon a violent windstorm came up, and the waves were breaking over the boat, so that it was being swamped.",
    "Mark 4:38": "But Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on the cushion. So they woke Him and said, “Teacher, don’t You care that we are perishing?”",
    "Mark 4:39": "Then Jesus got up and rebuked the wind and the sea. “Silence!” He commanded. “Be still!” And the wind died down, and it was perfectly calm.",
    "Mark 4:40": "“Why are you so afraid?” He asked. “Do you still have no faith?”",
    "Mark 4:41": "Overwhelmed with fear, they asked one another, “Who is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?”",
    "Mark 5:1": "On the other side of the sea, they arrived in the region of the Gerasenes.",
    "Mark 5:2": "As soon as Jesus got out of the boat, He was met by a man with an unclean spirit, who was coming from the tombs.",
    "Mark 5:3": "This man had been living in the tombs and could no longer be restrained, even with chains.",
    "Mark 5:4": "Though he was often bound with chains and shackles, he had broken the chains and shattered the shackles. Now there was no one with the strength to subdue him.",
    "Mark 5:5": "Night and day in the tombs and in the mountains he kept crying out and cutting himself with stones.",
    "Mark 5:6": "When the man saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees before Him.",
    "Mark 5:7": "And he shouted in a loud voice, “What do You want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You before God not to torture me!”",
    "Mark 5:8": "For Jesus had already declared, “Come out of this man, you unclean spirit!”",
    "Mark 5:9": "“What is your name?” Jesus asked. “My name is Legion,” he replied, “for we are many.”",
    "Mark 5:10": "And he begged Jesus repeatedly not to send them out of that region.",
    "Mark 5:11": "There on the nearby hillside a large herd of pigs was feeding.",
    "Mark 5:12": "So the demons begged Jesus, “Send us to the pigs, so that we may enter them.”",
    "Mark 5:13": "He gave them permission, and the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs, and the herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the water.",
    "Mark 5:14": "Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.",
    "Mark 5:15": "When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons sitting there, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.",
    "Mark 5:16": "Those who had seen it described what had happened to the demon-possessed man and also to the pigs.",
    "Mark 5:17": "And the people began to beg Jesus to leave their region.",
    "Mark 5:18": "As He was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed by the demons begged to go with Him.",
    "Mark 5:19": "But Jesus would not allow him. “Go home to your own people,” He said, “and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and what mercy He has shown you.”",
    "Mark 5:20": "So the man went away and began to proclaim throughout the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And everyone was amazed.",
    "Mark 5:21": "When Jesus had again crossed by boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around Him beside the sea.",
    "Mark 5:22": "A synagogue leader named Jairus arrived, and seeing Jesus, he fell at His feet",
    "Mark 5:23": "and pleaded with Him urgently, “My little daughter is near death. Please come and place Your hands on her, so that she will be healed and live.”",
    "Mark 5:24": "So Jesus went with him, and a large crowd followed and pressed around Him.",
    "Mark 5:25": "And a woman was there who had suffered from bleeding for twelve years.",
    "Mark 5:26": "She had borne much agony under the care of many physicians and had spent all she had, but to no avail. Instead, her condition had only grown worse.",
    "Mark 5:27": "When the woman heard about Jesus, she came up through the crowd behind Him and touched His cloak.",
    "Mark 5:28": "For she kept saying, “If only I touch His garments, I will be healed.”",
    "Mark 5:29": "Immediately her bleeding stopped, and she sensed in her body that she was healed of her affliction.",
    "Mark 5:30": "At once Jesus was aware that power had gone out from Him. Turning to the crowd, He asked, “Who touched My garments?”",
    "Mark 5:31": "His disciples answered, “You can see the crowd pressing in on You, and yet You ask, ‘Who touched Me?’”",
    "Mark 5:32": "But He kept looking around to see who had done this.",
    "Mark 5:33": "Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him trembling in fear, and she told Him the whole truth.",
    "Mark 5:34": "“Daughter,” said Jesus, “your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be free of your affliction.”",
    "Mark 5:35": "While He was still speaking, messengers from the house of Jairus arrived and said, “Your daughter is dead; why bother the Teacher anymore?”",
    "Mark 5:36": "But Jesus overheard their conversation and said to Jairus, “Do not be afraid; just believe.”",
    "Mark 5:37": "And He did not allow anyone to accompany Him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.",
    "Mark 5:38": "When they arrived at the house of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw the commotion and the people weeping and wailing loudly.",
    "Mark 5:39": "He went inside and asked, “Why all this commotion and weeping? The child is not dead, but asleep.”",
    "Mark 5:40": "And they laughed at Him. After He had put them all outside, He took the child’s father and mother and His own companions, and went in to see the child.",
    "Mark 5:41": "Taking her by the hand, Jesus said, “Talitha koum!” which means, “Little girl, I say to you, get up!”",
    "Mark 5:42": "Immediately the girl got up and began to walk around (she was twelve years old). And at once they were utterly astounded.",
    "Mark 5:43": "Then Jesus gave strict orders that no one should know about this, and He told them to give her something to eat.",
    "Mark 6:1": "Jesus went on from there and came to His hometown, accompanied by His disciples.",
    "Mark 6:2": "When the Sabbath came, He began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard Him were astonished. “Where did this man get these ideas?” they asked. “What is this wisdom He has been given? And how can He perform such miracles?",
    "Mark 6:3": "Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of Mary and the brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? Aren’t His sisters here with us as well?” And they took offense at Him.",
    "Mark 6:4": "Then Jesus said to them, “Only in his hometown, among his relatives, and in his own household is a prophet without honor.”",
    "Mark 6:5": "So He could not perform any miracles there, except to lay His hands on a few of the sick and heal them.",
    "Mark 6:6": "And He was amazed at their unbelief. And He went around from village to village, teaching the people.",
    "Mark 6:7": "Then Jesus called the Twelve to Him and began to send them out two by two, giving them authority over unclean spirits.",
    "Mark 6:8": "He instructed them to take nothing but a staff for the journey—no bread, no bag, no money in their belts—",
    "Mark 6:9": "and to wear sandals, but not a second tunic.",
    "Mark 6:10": "And He told them, “When you enter a house, stay there until you leave that area.",
    "Mark 6:11": "If anyone will not welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that place, as a testimony against them.”",
    "Mark 6:12": "So they set out and preached that the people should repent.",
    "Mark 6:13": "They also drove out many demons and healed many of the sick, anointing them with oil.",
    "Mark 6:14": "Now King Herod heard about this, for Jesus’ name had become well known, and people were saying, “John the Baptist has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”",
    "Mark 6:15": "Others were saying, “He is Elijah,” and still others, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.”",
    "Mark 6:16": "But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has risen from the dead!”",
    "Mark 6:17": "For Herod himself had ordered that John be arrested and bound and imprisoned, on account of his brother Philip’s wife Herodias, whom Herod had married.",
    "Mark 6:18": "For John had been telling Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife!”",
    "Mark 6:19": "So Herodias held a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she had been unable,",
    "Mark 6:20": "because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man. When he heard John’s words, he was greatly perplexed; yet he listened to him gladly.",
    "Mark 6:21": "On Herod’s birthday, her opportunity arose. Herod held a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.",
    "Mark 6:22": "When the daughter of Herodias came and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests, and the king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.”",
    "Mark 6:23": "And he swore to her, “Whatever you ask of me, I will give you, up to half my kingdom!”",
    "Mark 6:24": "Then she went out and asked her mother, “What should I request?” And her mother answered, “The head of John the Baptist.”",
    "Mark 6:25": "At once the girl hurried back to the king with her request: “I want you to give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter immediately.”",
    "Mark 6:26": "The king was consumed with sorrow, but because of his oaths and his guests, he did not want to refuse her.",
    "Mark 6:27": "So without delay, the king commanded that John’s head be brought in. He sent an executioner, who went and beheaded him in the prison.",
    "Mark 6:28": "The man brought John’s head on a platter and presented it to the girl, who gave it to her mother.",
    "Mark 6:29": "When John’s disciples heard about this, they came and took his body and placed it in a tomb.",
    "Mark 6:30": "Meanwhile, the apostles gathered around Jesus and brought Him news of all they had done and taught.",
    "Mark 6:31": "And He said to them, “Come with Me privately to a solitary place, and let us rest for a while.” For many people were coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat.",
    "Mark 6:32": "So they went away in a boat by themselves to a solitary place.",
    "Mark 6:33": "But many people saw them leaving and recognized them. They ran together on foot from all the towns and arrived before them.",
    "Mark 6:34": "When Jesus stepped ashore and saw a large crowd, He had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And He began to teach them many things.",
    "Mark 6:35": "By now the hour was already late. So the disciples came to Jesus and said, “This is a desolate place, and the hour is already late.",
    "Mark 6:36": "Dismiss the crowd so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.”",
    "Mark 6:37": "But Jesus told them, “You give them something to eat.” They asked Him, “Should we go out and spend two hundred denarii to give all of them bread to eat?”",
    "Mark 6:38": "“Go and see how many loaves you have,” He told them. And after checking, they said, “Five—and two fish.”",
    "Mark 6:39": "Then Jesus directed them to have the people sit in groups on the green grass.",
    "Mark 6:40": "So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.",
    "Mark 6:41": "Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, Jesus spoke a blessing and broke the loaves. Then He gave them to His disciples to set before the people. And He divided the two fish among them all.",
    "Mark 6:42": "They all ate and were satisfied,",
    "Mark 6:43": "and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish.",
    "Mark 6:44": "And there were five thousand men who had eaten the loaves.",
    "Mark 6:45": "Immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of Him to Bethsaida, while He dismissed the crowd.",
    "Mark 6:46": "After bidding them farewell, He went up on the mountain to pray.",
    "Mark 6:47": "When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and Jesus was alone on land.",
    "Mark 6:48": "He could see that the disciples were straining to row, because the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went out to them, walking on the sea. He intended to pass by them,",
    "Mark 6:49": "but when they saw Him walking on the sea, they cried out, thinking He was a ghost—",
    "Mark 6:50": "for they all saw Him and were terrified. But Jesus spoke up at once: “Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.”",
    "Mark 6:51": "Then He climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. And the disciples were utterly astounded,",
    "Mark 6:52": "for they had not understood about the loaves, but their hearts had been hardened.",
    "Mark 6:53": "When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and moored the boat.",
    "Mark 6:54": "As soon as they got out of the boat, the people recognized Jesus",
    "Mark 6:55": "and ran through that whole region, carrying the sick on mats to wherever they heard He was.",
    "Mark 6:56": "And wherever He went—villages and towns and countrysides—they laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged Him just to let them touch the fringe of His cloak. And all who touched Him were healed.",
    "Mark 7:1": "Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus,",
    "Mark 7:2": "and they saw some of His disciples eating with hands that were defiled—that is, unwashed.",
    "Mark 7:3": "Now in holding to the tradition of the elders, the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat until they wash their hands ceremonially.",
    "Mark 7:4": "And on returning from the market, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other traditions for them to observe, including the washing of cups, pitchers, kettles, and couches for dining.",
    "Mark 7:5": "So the Pharisees and scribes questioned Jesus: “Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders? Instead, they eat with defiled hands.”",
    "Mark 7:6": "Jesus answered them, “Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written: ‘These people honor Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me.",
    "Mark 7:7": "They worship Me in vain; they teach as doctrine the precepts of men.’",
    "Mark 7:8": "You have disregarded the commandment of God to keep the tradition of men.”",
    "Mark 7:9": "He went on to say, “You neatly set aside the command of God to maintain your own tradition.",
    "Mark 7:10": "For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother’ and ‘Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.’",
    "Mark 7:11": "But you say that if a man says to his father or mother, ‘Whatever you would have received from me is Corban’ (that is, a gift devoted to God),",
    "Mark 7:12": "he is no longer permitted to do anything for his father or mother.",
    "Mark 7:13": "Thus you nullify the word of God by the tradition you have handed down. And you do so in many such matters.”",
    "Mark 7:14": "Once again Jesus called the crowd to Him and said, “All of you, listen to Me and understand:",
    "Mark 7:15": "Nothing that enters a man from the outside can defile him; but the things that come out of a man, these are what defile him.”",
    "Mark 7:16": "",
    "Mark 7:17": "After Jesus had left the crowd and gone into the house, His disciples inquired about the parable.",
    "Mark 7:18": "“Are you still so dull?” He asked. “Do you not understand? Nothing that enters a man from the outside can defile him,",
    "Mark 7:19": "because it does not enter his heart, but it goes into the stomach and then is eliminated.” (Thus all foods are clean.)",
    "Mark 7:20": "He continued: “What comes out of a man, that is what defiles him.",
    "Mark 7:21": "For from within the hearts of men come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,",
    "Mark 7:22": "greed, wickedness, deceit, debauchery, envy, slander, arrogance, and foolishness.",
    "Mark 7:23": "All these evils come from within, and these are what defile a man.”",
    "Mark 7:24": "Jesus left that place and went to the region of Tyre. Not wanting anyone to know He was there, He entered a house, but was unable to escape their notice.",
    "Mark 7:25": "Instead, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit soon heard about Jesus, and she came and fell at His feet.",
    "Mark 7:26": "Now she was a Greek woman of Syrophoenician origin, and she kept asking Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.",
    "Mark 7:27": "“First let the children have their fill,” He said. “For it is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.”",
    "Mark 7:28": "“Yes, Lord,” she replied, “even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”",
    "Mark 7:29": "Then Jesus told her, “Because of this answer, you may go. The demon has left your daughter.”",
    "Mark 7:30": "And she went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon was gone.",
    "Mark 7:31": "Then Jesus left the region of Tyre and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis.",
    "Mark 7:32": "Some people brought to Him a man who was deaf and hardly able to speak, and they begged Jesus to place His hand on him.",
    "Mark 7:33": "So Jesus took him aside privately, away from the crowd, and put His fingers into the man’s ears. Then He spit and touched the man’s tongue.",
    "Mark 7:34": "And looking up to heaven, He sighed deeply and said to him, “Ephphatha!” (which means, “Be opened!”).",
    "Mark 7:35": "Immediately the man’s ears were opened and his tongue was released, and he began to speak plainly.",
    "Mark 7:36": "Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone. But the more He ordered them, the more widely they proclaimed it.",
    "Mark 7:37": "The people were utterly astonished and said, “He has done all things well! He makes even the deaf hear and the mute speak!”",
    "Mark 8:1": "In those days the crowd once again became very large, and they had nothing to eat. Jesus called the disciples to Him and said,",
    "Mark 8:2": "“I have compassion for this crowd, because they have already been with Me three days and have nothing to eat.",
    "Mark 8:3": "If I send them home hungry, they will faint along the way. For some of them have come a great distance.”",
    "Mark 8:4": "His disciples replied, “Where in this desolate place could anyone find enough bread to feed all these people?”",
    "Mark 8:5": "“How many loaves do you have?” Jesus asked. “Seven,” they replied.",
    "Mark 8:6": "And He instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground. Then He took the seven loaves, gave thanks and broke them, and gave them to His disciples to set before the people. And they distributed them to the crowd.",
    "Mark 8:7": "They also had a few small fish, and Jesus blessed them and ordered that these be set before them as well.",
    "Mark 8:8": "The people ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.",
    "Mark 8:9": "And about four thousand men were present. And when Jesus had dismissed the crowd,",
    "Mark 8:10": "He immediately got into the boat with His disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha.",
    "Mark 8:11": "Then the Pharisees came and began to argue with Jesus, testing Him by demanding from Him a sign from heaven.",
    "Mark 8:12": "Jesus sighed deeply in His spirit and said, “Why does this generation demand a sign? Truly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation.”",
    "Mark 8:13": "And He left them, got back into the boat, and crossed to the other side.",
    "Mark 8:14": "Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat.",
    "Mark 8:15": "“Watch out!” He cautioned them. “Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of Herod.”",
    "Mark 8:16": "So they began to discuss with one another the fact that they had no bread.",
    "Mark 8:17": "Aware of their conversation, Jesus asked them, “Why are you debating about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Do you have such hard hearts?",
    "Mark 8:18": "‘Having eyes, do you not see? And having ears, do you not hear?’ And do you not remember?",
    "Mark 8:19": "When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of broken pieces did you collect?” “Twelve,” they answered.",
    "Mark 8:20": "“And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of broken pieces did you collect?” “Seven,” they said.",
    "Mark 8:21": "Then He asked them, “Do you still not understand?”",
    "Mark 8:22": "When they arrived at Bethsaida, some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him.",
    "Mark 8:23": "So He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village. Then He spit on the man’s eyes and placed His hands on him. “Can you see anything?” He asked.",
    "Mark 8:24": "The man looked up and said, “I can see the people, but they look like trees walking around.”",
    "Mark 8:25": "Once again Jesus placed His hands on the man’s eyes, and when he opened them his sight was restored, and he could see everything clearly.",
    "Mark 8:26": "Jesus sent him home and said, “Do not go back into the village.”",
    "Mark 8:27": "Then Jesus and His disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way, He questioned His disciples: “Who do people say I am?”",
    "Mark 8:28": "They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets.”",
    "Mark 8:29": "“But what about you?” Jesus asked. “Who do you say I am?” Peter answered, “You are the Christ.”",
    "Mark 8:30": "And Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about Him.",
    "Mark 8:31": "Then He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and that He must be killed and after three days rise again.",
    "Mark 8:32": "He spoke this message quite frankly, and Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him.",
    "Mark 8:33": "But Jesus, turning and looking at His disciples, rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind Me, Satan! For you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men.”",
    "Mark 8:34": "Then Jesus called the crowd to Him along with His disciples, and He told them, “If anyone wants to come after Me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me.",
    "Mark 8:35": "For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake and for the gospel will save it.",
    "Mark 8:36": "What does it profit a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul?",
    "Mark 8:37": "Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?",
    "Mark 8:38": "If anyone is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in His Father’s glory with the holy angels.”",
    "Mark 9:1": "Then Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God arrive with power.”",
    "Mark 9:2": "After six days Jesus took with Him Peter, James, and John, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. There He was transfigured before them.",
    "Mark 9:3": "His clothes became radiantly white, brighter than any launderer on earth could bleach them.",
    "Mark 9:4": "And Elijah and Moses appeared before them, talking with Jesus.",
    "Mark 9:5": "Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”",
    "Mark 9:6": "For they were all so terrified that Peter did not know what else to say.",
    "Mark 9:7": "Then a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and a voice came from the cloud: “This is My beloved Son. Listen to Him!”",
    "Mark 9:8": "Suddenly, when they looked around, they saw no one with them except Jesus.",
    "Mark 9:9": "As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus admonished them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.",
    "Mark 9:10": "So they kept this matter to themselves, discussing what it meant to rise from the dead.",
    "Mark 9:11": "And they asked Jesus, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”",
    "Mark 9:12": "He replied, “Elijah does indeed come first, and he restores all things. Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected?",
    "Mark 9:13": "But I tell you that Elijah has indeed come, and they have done to him whatever they wished, just as it is written about him.”",
    "Mark 9:14": "When they returned to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them.",
    "Mark 9:15": "As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were filled with awe and ran to greet Him.",
    "Mark 9:16": "“What are you disputing with them?” He asked.",
    "Mark 9:17": "Someone in the crowd replied, “Teacher, I brought You my son, who has a spirit that makes him mute.",
    "Mark 9:18": "Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked Your disciples to drive it out, but they were unable.”",
    "Mark 9:19": "“O unbelieving generation!” Jesus replied. “How long must I remain with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy to Me.”",
    "Mark 9:20": "So they brought him, and seeing Jesus, the spirit immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.",
    "Mark 9:21": "Jesus asked the boy’s father, “How long has this been with him?” “From childhood,” he said.",
    "Mark 9:22": "“It often throws him into the fire or into the water, trying to kill him. But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.”",
    "Mark 9:23": "“If You can?” echoed Jesus. “All things are possible to him who believes!”",
    "Mark 9:24": "Immediately the boy’s father cried out, “I do believe; help my unbelief!”",
    "Mark 9:25": "When Jesus saw that a crowd had come running, He rebuked the unclean spirit. “You deaf and mute spirit,” He said, “I command you to come out and never enter him again.”",
    "Mark 9:26": "After shrieking and convulsing him violently, the spirit came out. The boy became like a corpse, so that many said, “He is dead.”",
    "Mark 9:27": "But Jesus took him by the hand and helped him to his feet, and he stood up.",
    "Mark 9:28": "After Jesus had gone into the house, His disciples asked Him privately, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?”",
    "Mark 9:29": "Jesus answered, “This kind cannot come out, except by prayer.”",
    "Mark 9:30": "Going on from there, they passed through Galilee. But Jesus did not want anyone to know,",
    "Mark 9:31": "because He was teaching His disciples. He told them, “The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill Him, and after three days He will rise.”",
    "Mark 9:32": "But they did not understand this statement, and they were afraid to ask Him about it.",
    "Mark 9:33": "Then they came to Capernaum. While Jesus was in the house, He asked them, “What were you discussing on the way?”",
    "Mark 9:34": "But they were silent, for on the way they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest.",
    "Mark 9:35": "Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, “If anyone wants to be first, he must be the last of all and the servant of all.”",
    "Mark 9:36": "Then He had a little child stand among them. Taking the child in His arms, He said to them,",
    "Mark 9:37": "“Whoever welcomes one of these little children in My name welcomes Me, and whoever welcomes Me welcomes not only Me, but the One who sent Me.”",
    "Mark 9:38": "John said to Him, “Teacher, we saw someone else driving out demons in Your name, and we tried to stop him, because he does not accompany us.”",
    "Mark 9:39": "“Do not stop him,” Jesus replied. “For no one who performs a miracle in My name can turn around and speak evil of Me.",
    "Mark 9:40": "For whoever is not against us is for us.",
    "Mark 9:41": "Indeed, if anyone gives you even a cup of water because you bear the name of Christ, truly I tell you, he will never lose his reward.",
    "Mark 9:42": "But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be thrown into the sea.",
    "Mark 9:43": "If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two hands and go into hell, into the unquenchable fire.",
    "Mark 9:44": "",
    "Mark 9:45": "If your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame than to have two feet and be thrown into hell.",
    "Mark 9:46": "",
    "Mark 9:47": "And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell,",
    "Mark 9:48": "where ‘their worm never dies, and the fire is never quenched.’",
    "Mark 9:49": "For everyone will be salted with fire.",
    "Mark 9:50": "Salt is good, but if the salt loses its saltiness, with what will you season it? Have salt among yourselves, and be at peace with one another.”",
    "Mark 10:1": "Then Jesus left that place and went into the region of Judea, beyond the Jordan. Again the crowds came to Him and He taught them, as was His custom.",
    "Mark 10:2": "Some Pharisees came to test Him. “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?” they inquired.",
    "Mark 10:3": "“What did Moses command you?” He replied.",
    "Mark 10:4": "They answered, “Moses permitted a man to write his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away.”",
    "Mark 10:5": "But Jesus told them, “Moses wrote this commandment for you because of your hardness of heart.",
    "Mark 10:6": "However, from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.’",
    "Mark 10:7": "‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife,",
    "Mark 10:8": "and the two will become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two, but one flesh.",

    "Mark 10:10": "When they were back inside the house, the disciples asked Jesus about this matter.",
    "Mark 10:11": "So He told them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.",
    "Mark 10:12": "And if a woman divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.”",
    "Mark 10:13": "Now people were bringing the little children to Jesus for Him to place His hands on them, and the disciples rebuked those who brought them.",
    "Mark 10:14": "But when Jesus saw this, He was indignant and told them, “Let the little children come to Me, and do not hinder them! For the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.",
    "Mark 10:15": "Truly I tell you, anyone who does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”",
    "Mark 10:16": "And He took the children in His arms, placed His hands on them, and blessed them.",
    "Mark 10:17": "As Jesus started on His way, a man ran up and knelt before Him. “Good Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”",
    "Mark 10:18": "“Why do you call Me good?” Jesus replied. “No one is good except God alone.",
    "Mark 10:19": "You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not cheat others, honor your father and mother.’”",
    "Mark 10:20": "“Teacher,” he replied, “all these I have kept from my youth.”",
    "Mark 10:21": "Jesus looked at him, loved him, and said to him, “There is one thing you lack: Go, sell everything you own and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me.”",
    "Mark 10:22": "But the man was saddened by these words and went away in sorrow, because he had great wealth.",
    "Mark 10:23": "Then Jesus looked around and said to His disciples, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!”",
    "Mark 10:24": "And the disciples were amazed at His words. But Jesus said to them again, “Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!",
    "Mark 10:25": "It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”",
    "Mark 10:26": "They were even more astonished and said to one another, “Who then can be saved?”",
    "Mark 10:27": "Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God.”",
    "Mark 10:28": "Peter began to say to Him, “Look, we have left everything and followed You.”",
    "Mark 10:29": "“Truly I tell you,” Jesus replied, “no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for My sake and for the gospel",
    "Mark 10:30": "will fail to receive a hundredfold in the present age—houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields, along with persecutions—and in the age to come, eternal life.",

    "Mark 10:32": "As they were going up the road to Jerusalem, Jesus was walking ahead of them. The disciples were amazed, but those who followed were afraid. Again Jesus took the Twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to Him:",
    "Mark 10:33": "“Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and scribes. They will condemn Him to death and will deliver Him over to the Gentiles,",

    "Mark 10:35": "Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Jesus and declared, “Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask.”",
    "Mark 10:36": "“What do you want Me to do for you?” He inquired.",
    "Mark 10:37": "They answered, “Grant that one of us may sit at Your right hand and the other at Your left in Your glory.”",
    "Mark 10:38": "“You do not know what you are asking,” Jesus replied. “Can you drink the cup I will drink, or be baptized with the baptism I will undergo?”",
    "Mark 10:39": "“We can,” the brothers answered. “You will drink the cup that I drink,” Jesus said, “and you will be baptized with the baptism that I undergo.",
    "Mark 10:40": "But to sit at My right or left is not Mine to grant. These seats belong to those for whom they have been prepared.”",
    "Mark 10:41": "When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John.",

    "Mark 10:44": "and whoever wants to be first must be the slave of all.",

    "Mark 10:50": "Throwing off his cloak, Bartimaeus jumped up and came to Jesus.",
    "Mark 10:51": "“What do you want Me to do for you?” Jesus asked. “Rabboni,” said the blind man, “let me see again.”",
    "Mark 10:52": "“Go,” said Jesus, “your faith has healed you.” And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.",
    "Mark 11:1": "As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent out two of His disciples",
    "Mark 11:2": "and said to them, “Go into the village ahead of you, and as soon as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here.",
    "Mark 11:3": "If anyone asks, ‘Why are you doing this?’ tell him, ‘The Lord needs it and will return it shortly.’”",
    "Mark 11:4": "So they went and found the colt outside in the street, tied at a doorway. They untied it,",
    "Mark 11:5": "and some who were standing there asked, “Why are you untying the colt?”",
    "Mark 11:6": "The disciples answered as Jesus had instructed them, and the people gave them permission.",

    "Mark 12:43": "Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, “Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put more than all the others into the treasury.",

    "Mark 14:20": "He answered, “It is one of the Twelve—the one who is dipping his hand into the bowl with Me.",
    "Mark 14:21": "The Son of Man will go just as it is written about Him, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed! It would be better for him if he had not been born.”",
    "Mark 14:22": "While they were eating, Jesus took bread, spoke a blessing and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, saying, “Take it; this is My body.”",

    "Mark 14:31": "But Peter kept insisting, “Even if I have to die with You, I will never deny You.” And all the others said the same thing.",
    "Mark 14:32": "Then they came to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus told His disciples, “Sit here while I pray.”",
    "Mark 14:33": "He took with Him Peter, James, and John, and began to be deeply troubled and distressed.",
    "Mark 14:34": "Then He said to them, “My soul is consumed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch.”",
    "Mark 14:35": "Going a little farther, He fell to the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour would pass from Him.",
    "Mark 14:36": "“Abba, Father,” He said, “all things are possible for You. Take this cup from Me. Yet not what I will, but what You will.”",
    "Mark 14:37": "Then Jesus returned and found them sleeping. “Simon, are you asleep?” He asked. “Were you not able to keep watch for one hour?",
    "Mark 14:38": "Watch and pray so that you will not enter into temptation. For the spirit is willing, but the body is weak.”",
    "Mark 14:39": "Again He went away and prayed, saying the same thing.",
    "Mark 14:40": "And again Jesus returned and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. And they did not know what to answer Him.",
    "Mark 14:41": "When Jesus returned the third time, He said, “Are you still sleeping and resting? That is enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.",
    "Mark 14:42": "Rise, let us go. See, My betrayer is approaching!”",
    "Mark 14:43": "While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, accompanied by a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, scribes, and elders.",
    "Mark 14:44": "Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The One I kiss is the man; arrest Him and lead Him away securely.”",
    "Mark 14:45": "Going directly to Jesus, he said, “Rabbi!” and kissed Him.",
    "Mark 14:46": "Then the men seized Jesus and arrested Him.",
    "Mark 14:47": "And one of the bystanders drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.",
    "Mark 14:48": "Jesus asked the crowd, “Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me as you would an outlaw?",
    "Mark 14:49": "Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest Me. But this has happened that the Scriptures would be fulfilled.”",
    "Mark 14:50": "Then everyone deserted Him and fled.",
    "Mark 14:51": "One young man who had been following Jesus was wearing a linen cloth around his body. They caught hold of him,",
    "Mark 14:52": "but he pulled free of the linen cloth and ran away naked.",
    "Mark 14:53": "They led Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests, elders, and scribes assembled.",
    "Mark 14:54": "Peter followed Him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. And he sat with the officers and warmed himself by the fire.",
    "Mark 14:55": "Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, but they did not find any.",
    "Mark 14:56": "For many bore false witness against Jesus, but their testimony was inconsistent.",
    "Mark 14:57": "Then some men stood up and testified falsely against Him:",
    "Mark 14:58": "“We heard Him say, ‘I will destroy this man-made temple, and in three days I will build another that is made without hands.’”",
    "Mark 14:59": "But even their testimony was inconsistent.",
    "Mark 14:60": "So the high priest stood up before them and questioned Jesus, “Have You no answer? What are these men testifying against You?”",
    "Mark 14:61": "But Jesus remained silent and made no reply. Again the high priest questioned Him, “Are You the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?”",
    "Mark 14:62": "“I am,” said Jesus, “and you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming with the clouds of heaven.”",
    "Mark 14:63": "At this, the high priest tore his clothes and declared, “Why do we need any more witnesses?",
    "Mark 14:64": "You have heard the blasphemy. What is your verdict?” And they all condemned Him as deserving of death.",
    "Mark 14:65": "Then some of them began to spit on Him. They blindfolded Him, struck Him with their fists, and said to Him, “Prophesy!” And the officers received Him with slaps in His face.",
    "Mark 14:66": "While Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the servant girls of the high priest came down",
    "Mark 14:67": "and saw him warming himself there. She looked at Peter and said, “You also were with Jesus the Nazarene.”",
    "Mark 14:68": "But he denied it. “I do not know or even understand what you are talking about,” he said. Then he went out to the gateway, and the rooster crowed.",
    "Mark 14:69": "There the servant girl saw him and again said to those standing nearby, “This man is one of them.”",
    "Mark 14:70": "But he denied it again. After a little while, those standing nearby said once more to Peter, “Surely you are one of them, for you too are a Galilean.”",
    "Mark 14:71": "But he began to curse and swear, “I do not know this man of whom you speak!”",
    "Mark 14:72": "And immediately the rooster crowed a second time. Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken to him: “Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times.” And he broke down and wept.",
    "Mark 15:1": "Early in the morning, the chief priests, elders, scribes, and the whole Sanhedrin devised a plan. They bound Jesus, led Him away, and handed Him over to Pilate.",
    "Mark 15:2": "So Pilate questioned Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” “You have said so,” Jesus replied.",
    "Mark 15:3": "And the chief priests began to accuse Him of many things.",
    "Mark 15:4": "Then Pilate questioned Him again, “Have You no answer? Look how many charges they are bringing against You!”",
    "Mark 15:5": "But to Pilate’s amazement, Jesus made no further reply.",
    "Mark 15:6": "Now it was Pilate’s custom at the feast to release to the people a prisoner of their choosing.",
    "Mark 15:7": "And a man named Barabbas was imprisoned with the rebels who had committed murder during the insurrection.",
    "Mark 15:8": "So the crowd went up and began asking Pilate to keep his custom.",
    "Mark 15:9": "“Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?” Pilate asked.",
    "Mark 15:10": "For he knew it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over.",
    "Mark 15:11": "But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release Barabbas to them instead.",
    "Mark 15:12": "So Pilate asked them again, “What then do you want me to do with the One you call the King of the Jews?”",
    "Mark 15:13": "And they shouted back, “Crucify Him!”",
    "Mark 15:14": "“Why?” asked Pilate. “What evil has He done?” But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify Him!”",
    "Mark 15:15": "And wishing to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed Him over to be crucified.",
    "Mark 15:16": "Then the soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called the whole company together.",
    "Mark 15:17": "They dressed Him in a purple robe, twisted together a crown of thorns, and set it on His head.",
    "Mark 15:18": "And they began to salute Him: “Hail, King of the Jews!”",
    "Mark 15:19": "They kept striking His head with a staff and spitting on Him. And they knelt down and bowed before Him.",
    "Mark 15:20": "After they had mocked Him, they removed the purple robe and put His own clothes back on Him. Then they led Him out to crucify Him.",
    "Mark 15:21": "Now Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and the soldiers forced him to carry the cross of Jesus.",
    "Mark 15:22": "They brought Jesus to a place called Golgotha, which means The Place of the Skull.",
    "Mark 15:23": "There they offered Him wine mixed with myrrh, but He did not take it.",
    "Mark 15:24": "And they crucified Him. They also divided His garments by casting lots to decide what each of them would take.",
    "Mark 15:25": "It was the third hour when they crucified Him.",
    "Mark 15:26": "And the charge inscribed against Him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS.",
    "Mark 15:27": "Along with Jesus, they crucified two robbers, one on His right and one on His left.",
    "Mark 15:28": "",
    "Mark 15:29": "And those who passed by heaped abuse on Him, shaking their heads and saying, “Aha! You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,",
    "Mark 15:30": "come down from the cross and save Yourself!”",
    "Mark 15:31": "In the same way, the chief priests and scribes mocked Him among themselves, saying, “He saved others, but He cannot save Himself!",
    "Mark 15:32": "Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and believe!” And even those who were crucified with Him berated Him.",
    "Mark 15:33": "From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.",
    "Mark 15:34": "At the ninth hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?” which means, “My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?”",
    "Mark 15:35": "When some of those standing nearby heard this, they said, “Behold, He is calling Elijah.”",
    "Mark 15:36": "And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine. He put it on a reed and held it up for Jesus to drink, saying, “Leave Him alone. Let us see if Elijah comes to take Him down.”",
    "Mark 15:37": "But Jesus let out a loud cry and breathed His last.",
    "Mark 15:38": "And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.",
    "Mark 15:39": "When the centurion standing there in front of Jesus saw how He had breathed His last, he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!”",
    "Mark 15:40": "And there were also women watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.",
    "Mark 15:41": "These women had followed Jesus and ministered to Him while He was in Galilee, and there were many other women who had come up to Jerusalem with Him.",
    "Mark 15:42": "Now it was already evening. Since it was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath),",
    "Mark 15:43": "Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent Council member who himself was waiting for the kingdom of God, boldly went to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus.",
    "Mark 15:44": "Pilate was surprised to hear that Jesus was already dead, so he summoned the centurion to ask if this was so.",
    "Mark 15:45": "When Pilate had confirmed it with the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.",
    "Mark 15:46": "So Joseph bought a linen cloth, took down the body of Jesus, wrapped it in the cloth, and placed it in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb.",
    "Mark 15:47": "Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw where His body was placed.",
    "Mark 16:1": "When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so they could go and anoint the body of Jesus.",
    "Mark 16:2": "Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they went to the tomb.",
    "Mark 16:3": "They were asking one another, “Who will roll away the stone from the entrance of the tomb?”",
    "Mark 16:4": "But when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away, even though it was extremely large.",
    "Mark 16:5": "When they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.",
    "Mark 16:6": "But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here! See the place where they put Him.",
    "Mark 16:7": "But go, tell His disciples and Peter, ‘He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see Him, just as He told you.’”",

    "Mark 16:11": "And when they heard that Jesus was alive and she had seen Him, they did not believe it.",
    "Mark 16:12": "After this, Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them as they walked along in the country.",

    "Luke 7:29": "All the people who heard this, even the tax collectors, acknowledged God’s justice. For they had received the baptism of John.",
    "Luke 7:30": "But the Pharisees and experts in the law rejected God’s purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.",
    "Luke 7:31": "“To what, then, can I compare the men of this generation? What are they like?",
    "Luke 7:32": "They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to one another: ‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.’",

    "Luke 7:42": "When they were unable to repay him, he forgave both of them. Which one, then, will love him more?”",
    "Luke 7:43": "“I suppose the one who was forgiven more,” Simon replied. “You have judged correctly,” Jesus said.",
    "Luke 7:44": "And turning toward the woman, He said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? When I entered your house, you did not give Me water for My feet, but she wet My feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.",

    "Luke 8:4": "While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, He told them this parable:",
    "Luke 8:5": "“A farmer went out to sow his seed. And as he was sowing, some seed fell along the path, where it was trampled, and the birds of the air devoured it.",
    "Luke 8:6": "Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the seedlings withered because they had no moisture.",
    "Luke 8:7": "Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the seedlings.",
    "Luke 8:8": "Still other seed fell on good soil, where it sprang up and produced a crop—a hundredfold.” As Jesus said this, He called out, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”",
    "Luke 8:9": "Then His disciples asked Him what this parable meant.",
    "Luke 8:10": "He replied, “The knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, ‘though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.’",
    "Luke 8:11": "Now this is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God.",
    "Luke 8:12": "The seeds along the path are those who hear, but the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.",
    "Luke 8:13": "The seeds on rocky ground are those who hear the word and receive it with joy, but they have no root. They believe for a season, but in the time of testing, they fall away.",
    "Luke 8:14": "The seeds that fell among the thorns are those who hear, but as they go on their way, they are choked by the worries, riches, and pleasures of this life, and their fruit does not mature.",
    "Luke 8:15": "But the seeds on good soil are those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, cling to it, and by persevering produce a crop.",
    "Luke 8:16": "No one lights a lamp and covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, he sets it on a stand, so those who enter can see the light.",
    "Luke 8:17": "For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be made known and brought to light.",
    "Luke 8:18": "Pay attention, therefore, to how you listen. Whoever has will be given more, but whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him.”",
    "Luke 8:19": "Then Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see Him, but they were unable to reach Him because of the crowd.",
    "Luke 8:20": "He was told, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see You.”",

    "Luke 8:24": "The disciples went and woke Him, saying, “Master, Master, we are perishing!” Then Jesus got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters, and they subsided, and all was calm.",
    "Luke 8:25": "“Where is your faith?” He asked. Frightened and amazed, they asked one another, “Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey Him!”",
    "Luke 8:26": "Then they sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, across the lake from Galilee.",
    "Luke 8:27": "When Jesus stepped ashore, He was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothing or lived in a house, but he stayed in the tombs.",

    "Luke 8:29": "For Jesus had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was bound with chains and shackles, he had broken the chains and been driven by the demon into solitary places.",
    "Luke 8:30": "“What is your name?” Jesus asked. “Legion,” he replied, because many demons had gone into him.",
    "Luke 8:31": "And the demons kept begging Jesus not to order them to go into the Abyss.",
    "Luke 8:32": "There on the hillside a large herd of pigs was feeding. So the demons begged Jesus to let them enter the pigs, and He gave them permission.",
    "Luke 8:33": "Then the demons came out of the man and went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.",
    "Luke 8:34": "When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside.",
    "Luke 8:35": "So the people went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus and found the man whom the demons had left, sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.",
    "Luke 8:36": "Meanwhile, those who had seen it reported how the demon-possessed man had been healed.",
    "Luke 8:37": "Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to depart from them, because great fear had taken hold of them. So He got into the boat and started back.",
    "Luke 8:38": "The man whom the demons had left begged to go with Jesus. But He sent him away, saying,",
    "Luke 8:39": "“Return home and describe how much God has done for you.” So the man went away and proclaimed all over the town how much Jesus had done for him.",
    "Luke 8:40": "When Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed Him, for they had all been waiting for Him.",
    "Luke 8:41": "Just then a synagogue leader named Jairus came and fell at Jesus’ feet. He begged Him to come to his house,",
    "Luke 8:42": "because his only daughter, who was about twelve, was dying. As Jesus went with him, the crowds pressed around Him,",
    "Luke 8:43": "including a woman who had suffered from bleeding for twelve years. She had spent all her money on physicians, but no one was able to heal her.",
    "Luke 8:44": "She came up behind Jesus and touched the fringe of His cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped.",
    "Luke 8:45": "“Who touched Me?” Jesus asked. But they all denied it. “Master,” said Peter, “the people are crowding and pressing against You.”",
    "Luke 8:46": "But Jesus declared, “Someone touched Me, for I know that power has gone out from Me.”",
    "Luke 8:47": "Then the woman, seeing that she could not escape notice, came trembling and fell down before Him. In the presence of all the people, she explained why she had touched Him and how she had immediately been healed.",
    "Luke 8:48": "“Daughter,” said Jesus, “your faith has healed you. Go in peace.”",
    "Luke 8:49": "While He was still speaking, someone arrived from the house of the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” he told Jairus. “Do not bother the Teacher anymore.”",
    "Luke 8:50": "But Jesus overheard them and said to Jairus, “Do not be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.”",
    "Luke 8:51": "When He entered the house, He did not allow anyone to go in with Him except Peter, John, James, and the child’s father and mother.",
    "Luke 8:52": "Meanwhile, everyone was weeping and mourning for her. But Jesus said, “Stop weeping; she is not dead but asleep.”",

    "Luke 9:6": "So they set out and went from village to village, preaching the gospel and healing people everywhere.",
    "Luke 9:7": "When Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, he was perplexed. For some were saying that John had risen from the dead,",
    "Luke 9:8": "others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that a prophet of old had arisen.",
    "Luke 9:9": "“I beheaded John,” Herod said, “but who is this man I hear such things about?” And he kept trying to see Jesus.",
    "Luke 9:10": "Then the apostles returned and reported to Jesus all that they had done. Taking them away privately, He withdrew to a town called Bethsaida.",

    "Luke 9:28": "About eight days after Jesus had said these things, He took with Him Peter, John, and James, and went up on a mountain to pray.",
    "Luke 9:29": "And as He was praying, the appearance of His face changed, and His clothes became radiantly white.",
    "Luke 9:30": "Suddenly two men, Moses and Elijah, began talking with Jesus.",
    "Luke 9:31": "They appeared in glory and spoke about His departure, which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.",
    "Luke 9:32": "Meanwhile Peter and his companions were overcome by sleep, but when they awoke, they saw Jesus’ glory and the two men standing with Him.",
    "Luke 9:33": "As Moses and Elijah were leaving, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” (He did not know what he was saying.)",
    "Luke 9:34": "While Peter was speaking, a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.",
    "Luke 9:35": "And a voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is My Son, whom I have chosen. Listen to Him!”",
    "Luke 9:36": "After the voice had spoken, only Jesus was present with them. The disciples kept this to themselves, and in those days they did not tell anyone what they had seen.",
    "Luke 9:37": "The next day, when they came down from the mountain, Jesus was met by a large crowd.",
    "Luke 9:38": "Suddenly a man in the crowd cried out, “Teacher, I beg You to look at my son, for he is my only child.",
    "Luke 9:39": "A spirit keeps seizing him, and he screams abruptly. It throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It keeps mauling him and rarely departs from him.",
    "Luke 9:40": "I begged Your disciples to drive it out, but they were unable.”",
    "Luke 9:41": "“O unbelieving and perverse generation!” Jesus replied. “How long must I remain with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.”",
    "Luke 9:42": "Even while the boy was approaching, the demon slammed him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.",
    "Luke 9:43": "And they were all astonished at the greatness of God. While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus was doing, He said to His disciples,",
    "Luke 9:44": "“Let these words sink into your ears: The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.”",
    "Luke 9:45": "But they did not understand this statement. It was veiled from them so that they could not comprehend it, and they were afraid to ask Him about it.",
    "Luke 9:46": "Then an argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest.",
    "Luke 9:47": "But Jesus, knowing the thoughts of their hearts, had a little child stand beside Him.",
    "Luke 9:48": "And He said to them, “Whoever welcomes this little child in My name welcomes Me, and whoever welcomes Me welcomes the One who sent Me. For whoever is the least among all of you, he is the greatest.”",
    "Luke 9:49": "“Master,” said John, “we saw someone driving out demons in Your name, and we tried to stop him, because he does not accompany us.”",
    "Luke 9:50": "“Do not stop him,” Jesus replied, “for whoever is not against you is for you.”",
    "Luke 9:51": "As the day of His ascension approached, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem.",
    "Luke 9:52": "He sent messengers on ahead, who went into a village of the Samaritans to make arrangements for Him.",
    "Luke 9:53": "But the people there refused to welcome Him, because He was heading for Jerusalem.",
    "Luke 9:54": "When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, “Lord, do You want us to call down fire from heaven to consume them?”",
    "Luke 9:55": "But Jesus turned and rebuked them.",
    "Luke 9:56": "And He and His disciples went on to another village.",
    "Luke 9:57": "As they were walking along the road, someone said to Jesus, “I will follow You wherever You go.”",
    "Luke 9:58": "Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay His head.”",
    "Luke 9:59": "Then He said to another man, “Follow Me.” The man replied, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”",
    "Luke 9:60": "But Jesus told him, “Let the dead bury their own dead. You, however, go and proclaim the kingdom of God.”",
    "Luke 9:61": "Still another said, “I will follow You, Lord; but first let me bid farewell to my family.”",
    "Luke 9:62": "Then Jesus declared, “No one who puts his hand to the plow and then looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.”",
    "Luke 10:1": "After this, the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them two by two ahead of Him to every town and place He was about to visit.",
    "Luke 10:2": "And He told them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into His harvest.",
    "Luke 10:3": "Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.",
    "Luke 10:4": "Carry no purse or bag or sandals. Do not greet anyone along the road.",
    "Luke 10:5": "Whatever house you enter, begin by saying, ‘Peace to this house.’",
    "Luke 10:6": "If a man of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; if not, it will return to you.",
    "Luke 10:7": "Stay at the same house, eating and drinking whatever you are offered. For the worker is worthy of his wages. Do not move around from house to house.",
    "Luke 10:8": "If you enter a town and they welcome you, eat whatever is set before you.",
    "Luke 10:9": "Heal the sick who are there and tell them, ‘The kingdom of God is near you.’",
    "Luke 10:10": "But if you enter a town and they do not welcome you, go into the streets and declare,",
    "Luke 10:11": "‘Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet, we wipe off as a testimony against you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God is near.’",
    "Luke 10:12": "I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town.",
    "Luke 10:13": "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.",
    "Luke 10:14": "But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.",
    "Luke 10:15": "And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades!",
    "Luke 10:16": "Whoever listens to you listens to Me; whoever rejects you rejects Me; and whoever rejects Me rejects the One who sent Me.”",
    "Luke 10:17": "The seventy-two returned with joy and said, “Lord, even the demons submit to us in Your name.”",
    "Luke 10:18": "So He told them, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.",
    "Luke 10:19": "Behold, I have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy. Nothing will harm you.",
    "Luke 10:20": "Nevertheless, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.”",
    "Luke 10:21": "At that time Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and declared, “I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was well-pleasing in Your sight.",
    "Luke 10:22": "All things have been entrusted to Me by My Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.”",
    "Luke 10:23": "Then Jesus turned to the disciples and said privately, “Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.",
    "Luke 10:24": "For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.”",
    "Luke 10:25": "One day an expert in the law stood up to test Him. “Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”",
    "Luke 10:26": "“What is written in the Law?” Jesus replied. “How do you read it?”",
    "Luke 10:27": "He answered, “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind’ and ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’”",
    "Luke 10:28": "“You have answered correctly,” Jesus said. “Do this and you will live.”",
    "Luke 10:29": "But wanting to justify himself, he asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”",
    "Luke 10:30": "Jesus took up this question and said, “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him, beat him, and went away, leaving him half dead.",
    "Luke 10:31": "Now by chance a priest was going down the same road, but when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.",
    "Luke 10:32": "So too, when a Levite came to that spot and saw him, he passed by on the other side.",
    "Luke 10:33": "But a Samaritan on a journey came upon him, and when he saw him, he had compassion.",
    "Luke 10:34": "He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.",
    "Luke 10:35": "The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Take care of him,’ he said, ‘and on my return I will repay you for any additional expense.’",
    "Luke 10:36": "Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?”",
    "Luke 10:37": "“The one who showed him mercy,” replied the expert in the law. Then Jesus told him, “Go and do likewise.”",
    "Luke 10:38": "As they traveled along, Jesus entered a village where a woman named Martha welcomed Him into her home.",
    "Luke 10:39": "She had a sister named Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet listening to His message.",
    "Luke 10:40": "But Martha was distracted by all the preparations to be made. She came to Jesus and said, “Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her to help me!”",
    "Luke 10:41": "“Martha, Martha,” the Lord replied, “you are worried and upset about many things.",
    "Luke 10:42": "But only one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion, and it will not be taken away from her.”",
    "Luke 11:1": "One day in a place where Jesus had just finished praying, one of His disciples requested, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.”",
    "Luke 11:2": "So Jesus told them, “When you pray, say: ‘Father, hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come.",
    "Luke 11:3": "Give us each day our daily bread.",
    "Luke 11:4": "And forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who sins against us. And lead us not into temptation.’”",
    "Luke 11:5": "Then Jesus said to them, “Suppose one of you goes to his friend at midnight and says, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,",
    "Luke 11:6": "because a friend of mine has come to me on a journey, and I have nothing to set before him.’",
    "Luke 11:7": "And suppose the one inside answers, ‘Do not bother me. My door is already shut, and my children and I are in bed. I cannot get up to give you anything.’",
    "Luke 11:8": "I tell you, even though he will not get up to provide for him because of his friendship, yet because of the man’s persistence, he will get up and give him as much as he needs.",
    "Luke 11:9": "So I tell you: Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.",
    "Luke 11:10": "For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.",
    "Luke 11:11": "What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead?",
    "Luke 11:12": "Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?",
    "Luke 11:13": "So if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!”",
    "Luke 11:14": "One day Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. And when the demon was gone, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowds were amazed,",
    "Luke 11:15": "but some of them said, “It is by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons, that He drives out demons.”",
    "Luke 11:16": "And others tested Him by demanding a sign from heaven.",
    "Luke 11:17": "Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself will be laid waste, and a house divided against a house will fall.",
    "Luke 11:18": "If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? After all, you say that I drive out demons by Beelzebul.",
    "Luke 11:19": "And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.",
    "Luke 11:20": "But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.",
    "Luke 11:21": "When a strong man, fully armed, guards his house, his possessions are secure.",
    "Luke 11:22": "But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armor in which the man trusted, and then he divides up his plunder.",
    "Luke 11:23": "He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters.",
    "Luke 11:24": "When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it passes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’",
    "Luke 11:25": "On its return, it finds the house swept clean and put in order.",
    "Luke 11:26": "Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and dwell there. And the final plight of that man is worse than the first.”",
    "Luke 11:27": "As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said, “Blessed is the womb that bore You, and blessed are the breasts that nursed You!”",
    "Luke 11:28": "But He replied, “Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it.”",
    "Luke 11:29": "As the crowds were increasing, Jesus said, “This is a wicked generation. It demands a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.",
    "Luke 11:30": "For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so the Son of Man will be a sign to this generation.",
    "Luke 11:31": "The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and now One greater than Solomon is here.",
    "Luke 11:32": "The men of Nineveh will stand at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now One greater than Jonah is here.",
    "Luke 11:33": "No one lights a lamp and puts it in a cellar or under a basket. Instead, he sets it on a stand, so those who enter can see the light.",
    "Luke 11:34": "Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are good, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are bad, your body is full of darkness.",
    "Luke 11:35": "Be careful, then, that the light within you is not darkness.",
    "Luke 11:36": "So if your whole body is full of light, with no part of it in darkness, you will be radiant, as though a lamp were shining on you.”",
    "Luke 11:37": "As Jesus was speaking, a Pharisee invited Him to dine with him; so He went in and reclined at the table.",
    "Luke 11:38": "But the Pharisee was surprised to see that Jesus did not first wash before the meal.",
    "Luke 11:39": "Then the Lord said, “Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.",
    "Luke 11:40": "You fools! Did not the One who made the outside make the inside as well?",
    "Luke 11:41": "But give as alms the things that are within you, and behold, everything will be clean for you.",
    "Luke 11:42": "Woe to you Pharisees! For you pay tithes of mint, rue, and every herb, but you disregard justice and the love of God. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former.",
    "Luke 11:43": "Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the chief seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces.",
    "Luke 11:44": "Woe to you! For you are like unmarked graves, which men walk over without even noticing.”",
    "Luke 11:45": "One of the experts in the law told Him, “Teacher, when You say these things, You insult us as well.”",
    "Luke 11:46": "“Woe to you as well, experts in the law!” He replied. “For you weigh men down with heavy burdens, but you yourselves will not lift a finger to lighten their load.",
    "Luke 11:47": "Woe to you! For you build tombs for the prophets, but it was your fathers who killed them.",
    "Luke 11:48": "So you are witnesses consenting to the deeds of your fathers: They killed the prophets, and you build their tombs.",
    "Luke 11:49": "Because of this, the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send them prophets and apostles; some of them they will kill and others they will persecute.’",
    "Luke 11:50": "As a result, this generation will be charged with the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the foundation of the world,",
    "Luke 11:51": "from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, all of it will be charged to this generation.",
    "Luke 11:52": "Woe to you experts in the law! For you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering.”",
    "Luke 11:53": "As Jesus went on from there, the scribes and Pharisees began to oppose Him bitterly and to ply Him with questions about many things,",
    "Luke 11:54": "waiting to catch Him in something He might say.",
    "Luke 12:1": "In the meantime, a crowd of many thousands had gathered, so that they were trampling one another. Jesus began to speak first to His disciples: “Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.",
    "Luke 12:2": "There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, and nothing hidden that will not be made known.",
    "Luke 12:3": "What you have spoken in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the housetops.",
    "Luke 12:4": "I tell you, My friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more.",

    "Luke 12:13": "Someone in the crowd said to Him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.”",
    "Luke 12:14": "But Jesus replied, “Man, who appointed Me judge or executor between you?”",
    "Luke 12:15": "And He said to them, “Watch out! Guard yourselves against every form of greed, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.”",
    "Luke 12:16": "Then He told them a parable: “The ground of a certain rich man produced an abundance.",
    "Luke 12:17": "So he thought to himself, ‘What shall I do, since I have nowhere to store my crops?’",
    "Luke 12:18": "Then he said, ‘This is what I will do: I will tear down my barns and will build bigger ones, and there I will store up all my grain and my goods.",
    "Luke 12:19": "Then I will say to myself, “You have plenty of good things laid up for many years. Take it easy. Eat, drink, and be merry!”’",
    "Luke 12:20": "But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life will be required of you. Then who will own what you have accumulated?’",
    "Luke 12:21": "This is how it will be for anyone who stores up treasure for himself but is not rich toward God.”",
    "Luke 12:22": "Then Jesus said to His disciples, “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat, or about your body, what you will wear.",
    "Luke 12:23": "For life is more than food, and the body more than clothes.",
    "Luke 12:24": "Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storehouse or barn; yet God feeds them. How much more valuable you are than the birds!",
    "Luke 12:25": "Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?",
    "Luke 12:26": "So if you cannot do such a small thing, why do you worry about the rest?",
    "Luke 12:27": "Consider how the lilies grow: They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his glory was adorned like one of these.",
    "Luke 12:28": "If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, how much more will He clothe you, O you of little faith!",
    "Luke 12:29": "And do not be concerned about what you will eat or drink. Do not worry about it.",

    "Luke 13:6": "Then Jesus told this parable: “A man had a fig tree that was planted in his vineyard. He went to look for fruit on it but did not find any.",
    "Luke 13:7": "So he said to the keeper of the vineyard, ‘Look, for the past three years I have come to search for fruit on this fig tree and haven’t found any. Therefore cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?’",
    "Luke 13:8": "‘Sir,’ the man replied, ‘leave it alone again this year, until I dig around it and fertilize it.",
    "Luke 13:9": "If it bears fruit next year, fine. But if not, you can cut it down.’”",
    "Luke 13:10": "One Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues,",
    "Luke 13:11": "and a woman there had been disabled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was hunched over and could not stand up straight.",
    "Luke 13:12": "When Jesus saw her, He called her over and said, “Woman, you are set free from your disability.”",
    "Luke 13:13": "Then He placed His hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and began to glorify God.",
    "Luke 13:14": "But the synagogue leader was indignant that Jesus had healed on the Sabbath. “There are six days for work,” he told the crowd. “So come and be healed on those days and not on the Sabbath.”",
    "Luke 13:15": "“You hypocrites!” the Lord replied. “Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the stall and lead it to water?",
    "Luke 13:16": "Then should not this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be released from her bondage on the Sabbath day?”",
    "Luke 13:17": "When Jesus said this, all His adversaries were humiliated. And the whole crowd rejoiced at all the glorious things He was doing.",
    "Luke 13:18": "Then Jesus asked, “What is the kingdom of God like? To what can I compare it?",
    "Luke 13:19": "It is like a mustard seed that a man tossed into his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air nested in its branches.”",
    "Luke 13:20": "Again He asked, “To what can I compare the kingdom of God?",
    "Luke 13:21": "It is like leaven that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour, until all of it was leavened.”",
    "Luke 13:22": "Then Jesus traveled throughout the towns and villages, teaching as He made His way toward Jerusalem.",
    "Luke 13:23": "“Lord,” someone asked Him, “will only a few people be saved?” Jesus answered,",
    "Luke 13:24": "“Make every effort to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able.",
    "Luke 13:25": "After the master of the house gets up and shuts the door, you will stand outside knocking and saying, ‘Lord, open the door for us.’ But he will reply, ‘I do not know where you are from.’",
    "Luke 13:26": "Then you will say, ‘We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.’",
    "Luke 13:27": "And he will answer, ‘I tell you, I do not know where you are from. Depart from me, all you evildoers.’",
    "Luke 13:28": "There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves are thrown out.",

    "Luke 13:31": "At that very hour, some Pharisees came to Jesus and told Him, “Leave this place and get away, because Herod wants to kill You.”",
    "Luke 13:32": "But Jesus replied, “Go tell that fox, ‘Look, I will keep driving out demons and healing people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach My goal.’",
    "Luke 13:33": "Nevertheless, I must keep going today and tomorrow and the next day, for it is not admissible for a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem.",
    "Luke 13:34": "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those sent to her, how often I have longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were unwilling!",

    "Luke 14:1": "One Sabbath, Jesus went to eat in the home of a leading Pharisee, and those in attendance were watching Him closely.",
    "Luke 14:2": "Right there before Him was a man with dropsy.",
    "Luke 14:3": "So Jesus asked the experts in the law and the Pharisees, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?”",
    "Luke 14:4": "But they remained silent. Then Jesus took hold of the man, healed him, and sent him on his way.",
    "Luke 14:5": "And He asked them, “Which of you whose son or ox falls into a pit on the Sabbath day will not immediately pull him out?”",
    "Luke 14:6": "And they were unable to answer these questions.",
    "Luke 14:7": "When Jesus noticed how the guests chose the places of honor, He told them a parable:",
    "Luke 14:8": "“When you are invited to a wedding banquet, do not sit in the place of honor, in case someone more distinguished than you has been invited.",
    "Luke 14:9": "Then the host who invited both of you will come and tell you, ‘Give this man your seat.’ And in humiliation, you will have to take the last place.",
    "Luke 14:10": "But when you are invited, go and sit in the last place, so that your host will come and tell you, ‘Friend, move up to a better place.’ Then you will be honored in front of everyone at the table with you.",
    "Luke 14:11": "For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”",
    "Luke 14:12": "Then Jesus said to the man who had invited Him, “When you host a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or brothers or relatives or rich neighbors. Otherwise, they may invite you in return, and you will be repaid.",
    "Luke 14:13": "But when you host a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind,",
    "Luke 14:14": "and you will be blessed. Since they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.”",
    "Luke 14:15": "When one of those reclining with Him heard this, he said to Jesus, “Blessed is everyone who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God.”",
    "Luke 14:16": "But Jesus replied, “A certain man prepared a great banquet and invited many guests.",
    "Luke 14:17": "When it was time for the banquet, he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited, ‘Come, for everything is now ready.’",
    "Luke 14:18": "But one after another they all began to make excuses. The first one said, ‘I have bought a field, and I need to go see it. Please excuse me.’",
    "Luke 14:19": "Another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out. Please excuse me.’",
    "Luke 14:20": "Still another said, ‘I have married a wife, so I cannot come.’",
    "Luke 14:21": "The servant returned and reported all this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and said to his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the city, and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.’",
    "Luke 14:22": "‘Sir,’ the servant replied, ‘what you ordered has been done, and there is still room.’",
    "Luke 14:23": "So the master told his servant, ‘Go out to the highways and hedges and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full.",
    "Luke 14:24": "For I tell you, not one of those men who were invited will taste my banquet.’”",
    "Luke 14:25": "Now large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and He turned and said to them,",
    "Luke 14:26": "“If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters—yes, even his own life—he cannot be My disciple.",
    "Luke 14:27": "And whoever does not carry his cross and follow Me cannot be My disciple.",
    "Luke 14:28": "Which of you, wishing to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost to see if he has the resources to complete it?",
    "Luke 14:29": "Otherwise, if he lays the foundation and is unable to finish the work, everyone who sees it will ridicule him,",
    "Luke 14:30": "saying, ‘This man could not finish what he started to build.’",
    "Luke 14:31": "Or what king on his way to war with another king will not first sit down and consider whether he can engage with ten thousand men the one coming against him with twenty thousand?",
    "Luke 14:32": "And if he is unable, he will send a delegation while the other king is still far off, to ask for terms of peace.",

    "Luke 15:15": "So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed the pigs.",
    "Luke 15:16": "He longed to fill his belly with the pods the pigs were eating, but no one would give him a thing.",
    "Luke 15:17": "Finally he came to his senses and said, ‘How many of my father’s hired servants have plenty of food, but here I am, starving to death!",

    "Luke 15:24": "For this son of mine was dead and is alive again! He was lost and is found!’ So they began to celebrate.",
    "Luke 15:25": "Meanwhile the older son was in the field, and as he approached the house, he heard music and dancing.",
    "Luke 15:26": "So he called one of the servants and asked what was going on.",
    "Luke 15:27": "‘Your brother has returned,’ he said, ‘and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has him back safe and sound.’",

    "Luke 15:31": "‘Son, you are always with me,’ the father said, ‘and all that is mine is yours.",
    "Luke 15:32": "But it was fitting to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’”",
    "Luke 16:1": "Jesus also said to His disciples, “There was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions.",
    "Luke 16:2": "So he called him in to ask, ‘What is this I hear about you? Turn in an account of your management, for you cannot be manager any longer.’",
    "Luke 16:3": "The manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do, now that my master is taking away my position? I am too weak to dig and too ashamed to beg.",
    "Luke 16:4": "I know what I will do so that after my removal from management, people will welcome me into their homes.’",
    "Luke 16:5": "And he called in each one of his master’s debtors. ‘How much do you owe my master?’ he asked the first.",
    "Luke 16:6": "‘A hundred measures of olive oil,’ he answered. ‘Take your bill,’ said the manager, ‘sit down quickly, and write fifty.’",
    "Luke 16:7": "Then he asked another, ‘And how much do you owe?’ ‘A hundred measures of wheat,’ he replied. ‘Take your bill and write eighty,’ he told him.",
    "Luke 16:8": "The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the sons of this age are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the sons of light.",

    "Luke 16:10": "Whoever is faithful with very little will also be faithful with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.",
    "Luke 16:11": "So if you have not been faithful with worldly wealth, who will entrust you with true riches?",
    "Luke 16:12": "And if you have not been faithful with the belongings of another, who will give you belongings of your own?",

    "Luke 18:36": "When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening.",
    "Luke 18:37": "“Jesus of Nazareth is passing by,” they told him.",
    "Luke 18:38": "So he called out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”",
    "Luke 18:39": "Those who led the way admonished him to be silent, but he cried out all the louder, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”",
    "Luke 18:40": "Jesus stopped and directed that the man be brought to Him. When he had come near, Jesus asked him,",
    "Luke 18:41": "“What do you want Me to do for you?” “Lord,” he said, “let me see again.”",
    "Luke 18:42": "“Receive your sight!” Jesus replied. “Your faith has healed you.”",
    "Luke 18:43": "Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.",
    "Luke 19:1": "Then Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through.",
    "Luke 19:2": "And there was a man named Zacchaeus, a chief tax collector, who was very wealthy.",
    "Luke 19:3": "He was trying to see who Jesus was, but could not see over the crowd because he was small in stature.",
    "Luke 19:4": "So he ran on ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see Him, since Jesus was about to pass that way.",
    "Luke 19:5": "When Jesus came to that place, He looked up and said, “Zacchaeus, hurry down, for I must stay at your house today.”",
    "Luke 19:6": "So Zacchaeus hurried down and welcomed Him joyfully.",
    "Luke 19:7": "And all who saw this began to grumble, saying, “He has gone to be the guest of a sinful man!”",
    "Luke 19:8": "But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord, half of my possessions I give to the poor, and if I have cheated anyone, I will repay it fourfold.”",
    "Luke 19:9": "Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because this man too is a son of Abraham.",
    "Luke 19:10": "For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”",
    "Luke 19:11": "While the people were listening to this, Jesus proceeded to tell them a parable, because He was near Jerusalem and they thought the kingdom of God would appear imminently.",
    "Luke 19:12": "So He said, “A man of noble birth went to a distant country to lay claim to his kingship and then return.",
    "Luke 19:13": "Beforehand, he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas. ‘Conduct business with this until I return,’ he said.",
    "Luke 19:14": "But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, ‘We do not want this man to rule over us.’",
    "Luke 19:15": "When he returned from procuring his kingship, he summoned the servants to whom he had given the money, to find out what each one had earned.",
    "Luke 19:16": "The first servant came forward and said, ‘Master, your mina has produced ten more minas.’",
    "Luke 19:17": "His master replied, ‘Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very small matter, you shall have authority over ten cities.’",
    "Luke 19:18": "The second servant came and said, ‘Master, your mina has made five minas.’",
    "Luke 19:19": "And to this one he said, ‘You shall have authority over five cities.’",
    "Luke 19:20": "Then another servant came and said, ‘Master, here is your mina, which I have laid away in a piece of cloth.",
    "Luke 19:21": "For I was afraid of you, because you are a harsh man. You withdraw what you did not deposit and reap what you did not sow.’",
    "Luke 19:22": "His master replied, ‘You wicked servant, I will judge you by your own words. So you knew that I am a harsh man, withdrawing what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow?",
    "Luke 19:23": "Why then did you not deposit my money in the bank, and upon my return I could have collected it with interest?’",
    "Luke 19:24": "Then he told those standing by, ‘Take the mina from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.’",
    "Luke 19:25": "‘Master,’ they said, ‘he already has ten!’",
    "Luke 19:26": "He replied, ‘I tell you that everyone who has will be given more; but the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.",
    "Luke 19:27": "And these enemies of mine who were unwilling for me to rule over them, bring them here and slay them in front of me.’”",
    "Luke 19:28": "After Jesus had said this, He went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.",
    "Luke 19:29": "As He approached Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, He sent out two of His disciples,",
    "Luke 19:30": "saying, “Go into the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here.",
    "Luke 19:31": "If anyone asks, ‘Why are you untying it?’ tell him, ‘The Lord needs it.’”",
    "Luke 19:32": "So those who were sent went out and found it just as Jesus had told them.",
    "Luke 19:33": "As they were untying the colt, its owners asked, “Why are you untying the colt?”",
    "Luke 19:34": "“The Lord needs it,” they answered.",
    "Luke 19:35": "Then they led the colt to Jesus, threw their cloaks over it, and put Jesus on it.",
    "Luke 19:36": "As He rode along, the people spread their cloaks on the road.",
    "Luke 19:37": "And as He approached the descent from the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of disciples began to praise God joyfully in a loud voice for all the miracles they had seen:",
    "Luke 19:38": "“Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord!” “Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!”",
    "Luke 19:39": "But some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Him, “Teacher, rebuke Your disciples!”",
    "Luke 19:40": "“I tell you,” He answered, “if they remain silent, the very stones will cry out.”",
    "Luke 19:41": "As Jesus approached Jerusalem and saw the city, He wept over it",
    "Luke 19:42": "and said, “If only you had known on this day what would bring you peace! But now it is hidden from your eyes.",
    "Luke 19:43": "For the days will come upon you when your enemies will barricade you and surround you and hem you in on every side.",
    "Luke 19:44": "They will level you to the ground—you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation from God.”",
    "Luke 19:45": "Then Jesus entered the temple courts and began to drive out those who were selling there.",
    "Luke 19:46": "He declared to them, “It is written: ‘My house will be a house of prayer.’ But you have made it ‘a den of robbers.’”",
    "Luke 19:47": "Jesus was teaching at the temple every day, but the chief priests, scribes, and leaders of the people were intent on killing Him.",
    "Luke 19:48": "Yet they could not find a way to do so, because all the people hung on His words.",
    "Luke 20:1": "One day as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courts and proclaiming the gospel, the chief priests and scribes, together with the elders, came up to Him.",
    "Luke 20:2": "“Tell us,” they said, “by what authority are You doing these things, and who gave You this authority?”",
    "Luke 20:3": "“I will also ask you a question,” Jesus replied. “Tell Me:",
    "Luke 20:4": "John’s baptism—was it from heaven, or from men?”",
    "Luke 20:5": "They deliberated among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will ask, ‘Why did you not believe him?’",
    "Luke 20:6": "But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.”",
    "Luke 20:7": "So they answered that they did not know where it was from.",
    "Luke 20:8": "And Jesus replied, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”",
    "Luke 20:9": "Then He proceeded to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard, rented it out to some tenants, and went away for a long time.",
    "Luke 20:10": "At harvest time, he sent a servant to the tenants to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat the servant and sent him away empty-handed.",
    "Luke 20:11": "So he sent another servant, but they beat him and treated him shamefully, sending him away empty-handed.",
    "Luke 20:12": "Then he sent a third, but they wounded him and threw him out.",
    "Luke 20:13": "‘What shall I do?’ asked the owner of the vineyard. ‘I will send my beloved son. Perhaps they will respect him.’",
    "Luke 20:14": "But when the tenants saw the son, they discussed it among themselves and said, ‘This is the heir. Let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’",
    "Luke 20:15": "So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?",
    "Luke 20:16": "He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.” And when the people heard this, they said, “May such a thing never happen!”",
    "Luke 20:17": "But Jesus looked directly at them and said, “Then what is the meaning of that which is written: ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone’?",
    "Luke 20:18": "Everyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed.”",
    "Luke 20:19": "When the scribes and chief priests realized that Jesus had spoken this parable against them, they sought to arrest Him that very hour. But they were afraid of the people.",
    "Luke 20:20": "So they watched Him closely and sent spies who pretended to be sincere. They were hoping to catch Him in His words in order to hand Him over to the rule and authority of the governor.",
    "Luke 20:21": "“Teacher,” they inquired, “we know that You speak and teach correctly. You show no partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.",
    "Luke 20:22": "Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”",
    "Luke 20:23": "But Jesus saw through their duplicity and said to them,",
    "Luke 20:24": "“Show Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?” “Caesar’s,” they answered.",
    "Luke 20:25": "So Jesus told them, “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”",
    "Luke 20:26": "And they were unable to trap Him in His words before the people. And amazed at His answer, they fell silent.",
    "Luke 20:27": "Then some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to question Him.",
    "Luke 20:28": "“Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man is to marry his brother’s widow and raise up offspring for him.",
    "Luke 20:29": "Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a wife but died childless.",
    "Luke 20:30": "Then the second",
    "Luke 20:31": "and the third married the widow, and in the same way all seven died, leaving no children.",
    "Luke 20:32": "And last of all, the woman died.",
    "Luke 20:33": "So then, in the resurrection, whose wife will she be? For all seven were married to her.”",
    "Luke 20:34": "Jesus answered, “The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage.",
    "Luke 20:35": "But those who are considered worthy to share in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage.",
    "Luke 20:36": "In fact, they can no longer die, because they are like the angels. And since they are sons of the resurrection, they are sons of God.",
    "Luke 20:37": "Even Moses demonstrates that the dead are raised, in the passage about the burning bush. For he calls the Lord ‘the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’",
    "Luke 20:38": "He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to Him all are alive.”",
    "Luke 20:39": "Some of the scribes answered, “Teacher, You have spoken well!”",
    "Luke 20:40": "And they did not dare to question Him any further.",
    "Luke 20:41": "Then Jesus declared, “How can it be said that the Christ is the Son of David?",
    "Luke 20:42": "For David himself says in the book of Psalms: ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at My right hand",
    "Luke 20:43": "until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.”’",
    "Luke 20:44": "Thus David calls Him ‘Lord.’ So how can He be David’s son?”",
    "Luke 20:45": "In the hearing of all the people, Jesus said to His disciples,",
    "Luke 20:46": "“Beware of the scribes. They like to walk around in long robes, and they love the greetings in the marketplaces, the chief seats in the synagogues, and the places of honor at banquets.",
    "Luke 20:47": "They defraud widows of their houses, and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will receive greater condemnation.”",
    "Luke 21:1": "Then Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury,",
    "Luke 21:2": "and He saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins.",
    "Luke 21:3": "“Truly I tell you,” He said, “this poor widow has put in more than all the others.",
    "Luke 21:4": "For they all contributed out of their surplus, but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to live on.”",
    "Luke 21:5": "As some of the disciples were remarking how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and consecrated gifts, Jesus said,",
    "Luke 21:6": "“As for what you see here, the time will come when not one stone will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.”",
    "Luke 21:7": "“Teacher,” they asked, “when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?”",
    "Luke 21:8": "Jesus answered, “See to it that you are not deceived. For many will come in My name, claiming, ‘I am He,’ and, ‘The time is near.’ Do not follow them.",
    "Luke 21:9": "When you hear of wars and rebellions, do not be alarmed. These things must happen first, but the end is not imminent.”",
    "Luke 21:10": "Then He told them, “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.",
    "Luke 21:11": "There will be great earthquakes, famines, and pestilences in various places, along with fearful sights and great signs from heaven.",
    "Luke 21:12": "But before all this, they will seize you and persecute you. On account of My name they will deliver you to the synagogues and prisons, and they will bring you before kings and governors.",
    "Luke 21:13": "This will be your opportunity to serve as witnesses.",
    "Luke 21:14": "So make up your mind not to worry beforehand how to defend yourselves.",
    "Luke 21:15": "For I will give you speech and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.",
    "Luke 21:16": "You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and some of you will be put to death.",
    "Luke 21:17": "And you will be hated by everyone because of My name.",
    "Luke 21:18": "Yet not even a hair of your head will perish.",
    "Luke 21:19": "By your patient endurance you will gain your souls.",
    "Luke 21:20": "But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, you will know that her desolation is near.",
    "Luke 21:21": "Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let those in the country stay out of the city.",
    "Luke 21:22": "For these are the days of vengeance, to fulfill all that is written.",
    "Luke 21:23": "How miserable those days will be for pregnant and nursing mothers! For there will be great distress upon the land and wrath against this people.",
    "Luke 21:24": "They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive into all the nations. And Jerusalem will be trodden down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.",
    "Luke 21:25": "There will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and on the earth dismay among the nations, bewildered by the roaring of the sea and the surging of the waves.",
    "Luke 21:26": "Men will faint from fear and anxiety over what is coming upon the earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.",
    "Luke 21:27": "At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.",
    "Luke 21:28": "When these things begin to happen, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.”",
    "Luke 21:29": "Then Jesus told them a parable: “Look at the fig tree and all the trees.",
    "Luke 21:30": "When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near.",
    "Luke 21:31": "So also, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.",
    "Luke 21:32": "Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have happened.",
    "Luke 21:33": "Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away.",
    "Luke 21:34": "But watch yourselves, or your hearts will be weighed down by dissipation, drunkenness, and the worries of life—and that day will spring upon you suddenly like a snare.",

    "Luke 21:36": "So keep watch at all times, and pray that you may have the strength to escape all that is about to happen and to stand before the Son of Man.”",
    "Luke 21:37": "Every day Jesus taught at the temple, but every evening He went out to spend the night on the Mount of Olives.",
    "Luke 21:38": "And early in the morning all the people would come to hear Him at the temple.",
    "Luke 22:1": "Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching,",
    "Luke 22:2": "and the chief priests and scribes were looking for a way to put Jesus to death, for they feared the people.",
    "Luke 22:3": "Then Satan entered Judas Iscariot, who was one of the Twelve.",
    "Luke 22:4": "And Judas went to discuss with the chief priests and temple officers how he might betray Jesus to them.",
    "Luke 22:5": "They were delighted and agreed to give him money.",
    "Luke 22:6": "Judas consented, and began to look for an opportunity to betray Jesus to them in the absence of a crowd.",
    "Luke 22:7": "Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed.",
    "Luke 22:8": "Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.”",
    "Luke 22:9": "“Where do You want us to prepare it?” they asked.",
    "Luke 22:10": "He answered, “When you enter the city, a man carrying a jug of water will meet you. Follow him to the house he enters,",
    "Luke 22:11": "and say to the owner of that house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?’",
    "Luke 22:12": "And he will show you a large upper room, already furnished. Make preparations there.”",
    "Luke 22:13": "So they went and found it just as Jesus had told them. And they prepared the Passover.",
    "Luke 22:14": "When the hour had come, Jesus reclined at the table with His apostles.",
    "Luke 22:15": "And He said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before My suffering.",

    "Luke 22:20": "In the same way, after supper He took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is poured out for you.",
    "Luke 22:21": "Look! The hand of My betrayer is with Mine on the table.",
    "Luke 22:22": "Indeed, the Son of Man will go as it has been determined, but woe to that man who betrays Him.”",
    "Luke 22:23": "Then they began to question among themselves which of them was going to do this.",
    "Luke 22:24": "A dispute also arose among the disciples as to which of them should be considered the greatest.",
    "Luke 22:25": "So Jesus declared, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in authority over them call themselves benefactors.",
    "Luke 22:26": "But you shall not be like them. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves.",
    "Luke 22:27": "For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines? But I am among you as one who serves.",
    "Luke 22:28": "You are the ones who have stood by Me in My trials.",
    "Luke 22:29": "And I bestow on you a kingdom, just as My Father has bestowed one on Me,",
    "Luke 22:30": "so that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.",

    "Luke 22:33": "“Lord,” said Peter, “I am ready to go with You even to prison and to death.”",
    "Luke 22:34": "But Jesus replied, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me.”",
    "Luke 22:35": "Then Jesus asked them, “When I sent you out without purse or bag or sandals, did you lack anything?” “Nothing,” they answered.",
    "Luke 22:36": "“Now, however,” He told them, “the one with a purse should take it, and likewise a bag; and the one without a sword should sell his cloak and buy one.",
    "Luke 22:37": "For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in Me: ‘And He was numbered with the transgressors.’ For what is written about Me is reaching its fulfillment.”",
    "Luke 22:38": "So they said, “Look, Lord, here are two swords.” “That is enough,” He answered.",
    "Luke 22:39": "Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed Him.",
    "Luke 22:40": "When He came to the place, He told them, “Pray that you will not enter into temptation.”",
    "Luke 22:41": "And He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, where He knelt down and prayed,",
    "Luke 22:42": "“Father, if You are willing, take this cup from Me. Yet not My will, but Yours be done.”",

    "Luke 22:44": "And in His anguish, He prayed more earnestly, and His sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground.",
    "Luke 22:45": "When Jesus rose from prayer and returned to the disciples, He found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.",
    "Luke 22:46": "“Why are you sleeping?” He asked. “Get up and pray so that you will not enter into temptation.”",
    "Luke 22:47": "While He was still speaking, a crowd arrived, led by the man called Judas, one of the Twelve. He approached Jesus to kiss Him.",
    "Luke 22:48": "But Jesus asked him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”",
    "Luke 22:49": "Those around Jesus saw what was about to happen and said, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?”",
    "Luke 22:50": "And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.",
    "Luke 22:51": "But Jesus answered, “No more of this!” And He touched the man’s ear and healed him.",
    "Luke 22:52": "Then Jesus said to the chief priests, temple officers, and elders who had come for Him, “Have you come out with swords and clubs as you would against an outlaw?",
    "Luke 22:53": "Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on Me. But this hour belongs to you and to the power of darkness.”",

    "Luke 22:59": "About an hour later, another man insisted, “Certainly this man was with Him, for he too is a Galilean.”",
    "Luke 22:60": "“Man, I do not know what you are talking about,” Peter replied. And immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.",
    "Luke 22:61": "And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word that the Lord had spoken to him: “Before the rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times.”",

    "John 3:35": "The Father loves the Son and has placed all things in His hands.",
    "John 3:36": "Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life. Whoever rejects the Son will not see life. Instead, the wrath of God remains on him.”",
    "John 4:1": "When Jesus realized that the Pharisees were aware He was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John",
    "John 4:2": "(although it was not Jesus who baptized, but His disciples),",
    "John 4:3": "He left Judea and returned to Galilee.",
    "John 4:4": "Now He had to pass through Samaria.",
    "John 4:5": "So He came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.",
    "John 4:6": "Since Jacob’s well was there, Jesus, weary from His journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.",
    "John 4:7": "When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, “Give Me a drink.”",
    "John 4:8": "(His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)",
    "John 4:9": "“You are a Jew,” said the woman. “How can You ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.)",
    "John 4:10": "Jesus answered, “If you knew the gift of God and who is asking you for a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.”",
    "John 4:11": "“Sir,” the woman replied, “You have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where then will You get this living water?",
    "John 4:12": "Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us this well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock?”",
    "John 4:13": "Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again.",
    "John 4:14": "But whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a fount of water springing up to eternal life.”",
    "John 4:15": "The woman said to Him, “Sir, give me this water so that I will not get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.”",
    "John 4:16": "Jesus told her, “Go, call your husband and come back.”",
    "John 4:17": "“I have no husband,” the woman replied. Jesus said to her, “You are correct to say that you have no husband.",
    "John 4:18": "In fact, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. You have spoken truthfully.”",
    "John 4:19": "“Sir,” the woman said, “I see that You are a prophet.",
    "John 4:20": "Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews say that the place where one must worship is in Jerusalem.”",
    "John 4:21": "“Believe Me, woman,” Jesus replied, “a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.",
    "John 4:22": "You worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews.",
    "John 4:23": "But a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for the Father is seeking such as these to worship Him.",
    "John 4:24": "God is Spirit, and His worshipers must worship Him in spirit and in truth.”",
    "John 4:25": "The woman said, “I know that Messiah” (called Christ) “is coming. When He comes, He will explain everything to us.”",
    "John 4:26": "Jesus answered, “I who speak to you am He.”",
    "John 4:27": "Just then His disciples returned and were surprised that He was speaking with a woman. But no one asked Him, “What do You want from her?” or “Why are You talking with her?”",
    "John 4:28": "Then the woman left her water jar, went back into the town, and said to the people,",
    "John 4:29": "“Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?”",
    "John 4:30": "So they left the town and made their way toward Jesus.",
    "John 4:31": "Meanwhile the disciples urged Him, “Rabbi, eat something.”",
    "John 4:32": "But He told them, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.”",
    "John 4:33": "So the disciples asked one another, “Could someone have brought Him food?”",
    "John 4:34": "Jesus explained, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work.",
    "John 4:35": "Do you not say, ‘There are still four months until the harvest’? I tell you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are ripe for harvest.",
    "John 4:36": "Already the reaper draws his wages and gathers a crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.",
    "John 4:37": "For in this case the saying ‘One sows and another reaps’ is true.",
    "John 4:38": "I sent you to reap what you have not worked for; others have done the hard work, and now you have taken up their labor.”",
    "John 4:39": "Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in Jesus because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me everything I ever did.”",
    "John 4:40": "So when the Samaritans came to Him, they asked Him to stay with them, and He stayed two days.",
    "John 4:41": "And many more believed because of His message.",
    "John 4:42": "They said to the woman, “We now believe not only because of your words; we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man truly is the Savior of the world.”",
    "John 4:43": "After two days, Jesus left for Galilee.",
    "John 4:44": "Now He Himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown.",
    "John 4:45": "Yet when He arrived, the Galileans welcomed Him. They had seen all the great things He had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they had gone there as well.",
    "John 4:46": "So once again He came to Cana in Galilee, where He had turned the water into wine. And there was a royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum.",
    "John 4:47": "When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and begged Him to come down and heal his son, who was about to die.",
    "John 4:48": "Jesus said to him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe.”",
    "John 4:49": "“Sir,” the official said, “come down before my child dies.”",
    "John 4:50": "“Go,” said Jesus. “Your son will live.” The man took Jesus at His word and departed.",
    "John 4:51": "And while he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was alive.",
    "John 4:52": "So he inquired as to the hour when his son had recovered, and they told him, “The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour.”",
    "John 4:53": "Then the father realized that this was the very hour in which Jesus had told him, “Your son will live.” And he and all his household believed.",
    "John 4:54": "This was now the second sign that Jesus performed after coming from Judea into Galilee.",
    "John 5:1": "Some time later there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.",
    "John 5:2": "Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool with five covered colonnades, which in Hebrew is called Bethesda.",
    "John 5:3": "On these walkways lay a great number of the sick, the blind, the lame, and the paralyzed.",
    "John 5:4": "",
    "John 5:5": "One man there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.",
    "John 5:6": "When Jesus saw him lying there and realized that he had spent a long time in this condition, He asked him, “Do you want to get well?”",
    "John 5:7": "“Sir,” the invalid replied, “I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am on my way, someone else goes in before me.”",
    "John 5:8": "Then Jesus told him, “Get up, pick up your mat, and walk.”",
    "John 5:9": "Immediately the man was made well, and he picked up his mat and began to walk. Now this happened on the Sabbath day,",
    "John 5:10": "so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, “This is the Sabbath! It is unlawful for you to carry your mat.”",
    "John 5:11": "But he answered, “The man who made me well told me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’”",
    "John 5:12": "“Who is this man who told you to pick it up and walk?” they asked.",
    "John 5:13": "But the man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away while the crowd was there.",
    "John 5:14": "Afterward, Jesus found the man at the temple and said to him, “See, you have been made well. Stop sinning, or something worse may happen to you.”",
    "John 5:15": "And the man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.",
    "John 5:16": "Now because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews began to persecute Him.",
    "John 5:17": "But Jesus answered them, “To this very day My Father is at His work, and I too am working.”",
    "John 5:18": "Because of this, the Jews tried all the harder to kill Him. Not only was He breaking the Sabbath, but He was even calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.",
    "John 5:19": "So Jesus replied, “Truly, truly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing by Himself, unless He sees the Father doing it. For whatever the Father does, the Son also does.",
    "John 5:20": "The Father loves the Son and shows Him all He does. And to your amazement, He will show Him even greater works than these.",
    "John 5:21": "For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wishes.",
    "John 5:22": "Furthermore, the Father judges no one, but has assigned all judgment to the Son,",
    "John 5:23": "so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.",
    "John 5:24": "Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life and will not come under judgment. Indeed, he has crossed over from death to life.",
    "John 5:25": "Truly, truly, I tell you, the hour is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.",
    "John 5:26": "For as the Father has life in Himself, so also He has granted the Son to have life in Himself.",
    "John 5:27": "And He has given Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man.",
    "John 5:28": "Do not be amazed at this, for the hour is coming when all who are in their graves will hear His voice",
    "John 5:29": "and come out—those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.",
    "John 5:30": "I can do nothing by Myself; I judge only as I hear. And My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.",
    "John 5:31": "If I testify about Myself, My testimony is not valid.",
    "John 5:32": "There is another who testifies about Me, and I know that His testimony about Me is valid.",
    "John 5:33": "You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.",
    "John 5:34": "Even though I do not accept human testimony, I say these things so that you may be saved.",
    "John 5:35": "John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you were willing for a season to bask in his light.",
    "John 5:36": "But I have testimony more substantial than that of John. For the works that the Father has given Me to accomplish—the very works I am doing—testify about Me that the Father has sent Me.",
    "John 5:37": "And the Father who sent Me has Himself testified about Me. You have never heard His voice nor seen His form,",
    "John 5:38": "nor does His word abide in you, because you do not believe the One He sent.",
    "John 5:39": "You pore over the Scriptures because you presume that by them you possess eternal life. These are the very words that testify about Me,",
    "John 5:40": "yet you refuse to come to Me to have life.",
    "John 5:41": "I do not accept glory from men,",
    "John 5:42": "but I know you, that you do not have the love of God within you.",
    "John 5:43": "I have come in My Father’s name, and you have not received Me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will receive him.",
    "John 5:44": "How can you believe if you accept glory from one another, yet do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?",
    "John 5:45": "Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, in whom you have put your hope.",
    "John 5:46": "If you had believed Moses, you would believe Me, because he wrote about Me.",
    "John 5:47": "But since you do not believe what he wrote, how will you believe what I say?”",
    "John 6:1": "After this, Jesus crossed to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias).",
    "John 6:2": "A large crowd followed Him because they saw the signs He was performing on the sick.",
    "John 6:3": "Then Jesus went up on the mountain and sat down with His disciples.",
    "John 6:4": "Now the Jewish Feast of the Passover was near.",
    "John 6:5": "When Jesus looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward Him, He said to Philip, “Where can we buy bread for these people to eat?”",
    "John 6:6": "But He was asking this to test him, for He knew what He was about to do.",
    "John 6:7": "Philip answered, “Two hundred denarii would not buy enough bread for each of them to have a small piece.”",
    "John 6:8": "One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to Him,",
    "John 6:9": "“Here is a boy with five barley loaves and two small fish. But what difference will these make among so many?”",
    "John 6:10": "“Have the people sit down,” Jesus said. Now there was plenty of grass in that place, so the men sat down, about five thousand of them.",
    "John 6:11": "Then Jesus took the loaves and the fish, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted.",
    "John 6:12": "And when everyone was full, He said to His disciples, “Gather the pieces that are left over, so that nothing will be wasted.”",
    "John 6:13": "So they collected them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.",
    "John 6:14": "When the people saw the sign that Jesus had performed, they began to say, “Truly this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.”",
    "John 6:15": "Then Jesus, realizing that they were about to come and make Him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by Himself.",
    "John 6:16": "When evening came, His disciples went down to the sea,",
    "John 6:17": "got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was already dark, and Jesus had not yet gone out to them.",
    "John 6:18": "A strong wind was blowing, and the sea grew agitated.",
    "John 6:19": "When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the sea—and they were terrified.",
    "John 6:20": "But Jesus spoke up: “It is I; do not be afraid.”",
    "John 6:21": "Then they were willing to take Him into the boat, and at once the boat reached the shore where they were heading.",
    "John 6:22": "The next day, the crowd that had remained on the other side of the sea realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not boarded it with His disciples, but they had gone away alone.",
    "John 6:23": "However, some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.",
    "John 6:24": "So when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum to look for Him.",
    "John 6:25": "When they found Him on the other side of the sea, they asked Him, “Rabbi, when did You get here?”",
    "John 6:26": "Jesus replied, “Truly, truly, I tell you, it is not because you saw these signs that you are looking for Me, but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.",
    "John 6:27": "Do not work for food that perishes, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on Him God the Father has placed His seal of approval.”",
    "John 6:28": "Then they inquired, “What must we do to perform the works of God?”",
    "John 6:29": "Jesus replied, “The work of God is this: to believe in the One He has sent.”",
    "John 6:30": "So they asked Him, “What sign then will You perform, so that we may see it and believe You? What will You do?",
    "John 6:31": "Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”",
    "John 6:32": "Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I tell you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but it is My Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.",
    "John 6:33": "For the bread of God is He who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”",
    "John 6:34": "“Sir,” they said, “give us this bread at all times.”",
    "John 6:35": "Jesus answered, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to Me will never hunger, and whoever believes in Me will never thirst.",
    "John 6:36": "But as I stated, you have seen Me and still you do not believe.",
    "John 6:37": "Everyone the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will never drive away.",
    "John 6:38": "For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but to do the will of Him who sent Me.",
    "John 6:39": "And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that I shall lose none of those He has given Me, but raise them up at the last day.",
    "John 6:40": "For it is My Father’s will that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in Him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.”",
    "John 6:41": "At this, the Jews began to grumble about Jesus because He had said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven.”",
    "John 6:42": "They were asking, “Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then can He say, ‘I have come down from heaven?’”",
    "John 6:43": "“Stop grumbling among yourselves,” Jesus replied.",
    "John 6:44": "“No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day.",
    "John 6:45": "It is written in the Prophets: ‘And they will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from Him comes to Me—",
    "John 6:46": "not that anyone has seen the Father except the One who is from God; only He has seen the Father.",
    "John 6:47": "Truly, truly, I tell you, he who believes has eternal life.",
    "John 6:48": "I am the bread of life.",
    "John 6:49": "Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died.",
    "John 6:50": "This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that anyone may eat of it and not die.",
    "John 6:51": "I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And this bread, which I will give for the life of the world, is My flesh.”",
    "John 6:52": "At this, the Jews began to argue among themselves, “How can this man give us His flesh to eat?”",
    "John 6:53": "So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of Man, you have no life in you.",
    "John 6:54": "Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.",
    "John 6:55": "For My flesh is real food, and My blood is real drink.",
    "John 6:56": "Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood remains in Me, and I in him.",
    "John 6:57": "Just as the living Father sent Me and I live because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on Me will live because of Me.",
    "John 6:58": "This is the bread that came down from heaven. Unlike your fathers, who ate the manna and died, the one who eats this bread will live forever.”",
    "John 6:59": "Jesus said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.",
    "John 6:60": "On hearing it, many of His disciples said, “This is a difficult teaching. Who can accept it?”",
    "John 6:61": "Aware that His disciples were grumbling about this teaching, Jesus asked them, “Does this offend you?",
    "John 6:62": "Then what will happen if you see the Son of Man ascend to where He was before?",
    "John 6:63": "The Spirit gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life.",
    "John 6:64": "However, there are some of you who do not believe.” (For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray Him.)",
    "John 6:65": "Then Jesus said, “This is why I told you that no one can come to Me unless the Father has granted it to him.”",
    "John 6:66": "From that time on many of His disciples turned back and no longer walked with Him.",
    "John 6:67": "So Jesus asked the Twelve, “Do you want to leave too?”",
    "John 6:68": "Simon Peter replied, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.",
    "John 6:69": "We believe and know that You are the Holy One of God.”",
    "John 6:70": "Jesus answered them, “Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!”",
    "John 6:71": "He was speaking about Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. For although Judas was one of the Twelve, he was later to betray Jesus.",
    "John 7:1": "After this, Jesus traveled throughout Galilee. He did not want to travel in Judea, because the Jews there were trying to kill Him.",
    "John 7:2": "However, the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near.",
    "John 7:3": "So Jesus’ brothers said to Him, “Leave here and go to Judea, so that Your disciples there may see the works You are doing.",
    "John 7:4": "For no one who wants to be known publicly acts in secret. Since You are doing these things, show Yourself to the world.”",
    "John 7:5": "For even His own brothers did not believe in Him.",
    "John 7:6": "Therefore Jesus told them, “Although your time is always at hand, My time has not yet come.",
    "John 7:7": "The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me, because I testify that its works are evil.",
    "John 7:8": "Go up to the feast on your own. I am not going up to this feast, because My time has not yet come.”",
    "John 7:9": "Having said this, Jesus remained in Galilee.",
    "John 7:10": "But after His brothers had gone up to the feast, He also went—not publicly, but in secret.",
    "John 7:11": "So the Jews were looking for Him at the feast and asking, “Where is He?”",
    "John 7:12": "Many in the crowds were whispering about Him. Some said, “He is a good man.” But others replied, “No, He deceives the people.”",
    "John 7:13": "Yet no one would speak publicly about Him for fear of the Jews.",
    "John 7:14": "About halfway through the feast, Jesus went up to the temple courts and began to teach.",
    "John 7:15": "The Jews were amazed and asked, “How did this man attain such learning without having studied?”",
    "John 7:16": "“My teaching is not My own,” Jesus replied. “It comes from Him who sent Me.",
    "John 7:17": "If anyone desires to do His will, he will know whether My teaching is from God or whether I speak on My own.",
    "John 7:18": "He who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory, but He who seeks the glory of the One who sent Him is a man of truth; in Him there is no falsehood.",
    "John 7:19": "Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps it. Why are you trying to kill Me?”",
    "John 7:20": "“You have a demon,” the crowd replied. “Who is trying to kill You?”",
    "John 7:21": "Jesus answered them, “I did one miracle, and you are all amazed.",
    "John 7:22": "But because Moses gave you circumcision, you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath (not that it is from Moses, but from the patriarchs.)",
    "John 7:23": "If a boy can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses will not be broken, why are you angry with Me for making the whole man well on the Sabbath?",
    "John 7:24": "Stop judging by outward appearances, and start judging justly.”",
    "John 7:25": "Then some of the people of Jerusalem began to say, “Isn’t this the man they are trying to kill?",
    "John 7:26": "Yet here He is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying anything to Him. Have the rulers truly recognized that this is the Christ?",
    "John 7:27": "But we know where this man is from. When the Christ comes, no one will know where He is from.”",
    "John 7:28": "Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts, cried out, “You know Me, and you know where I am from. I have not come of My own accord, but He who sent Me is true. You do not know Him,",
    "John 7:29": "but I know Him, because I am from Him and He sent Me.”",
    "John 7:30": "So they tried to seize Him, but no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.",
    "John 7:31": "Many in the crowd, however, believed in Him and said, “When the Christ comes, will He perform more signs than this man?”",
    "John 7:32": "When the Pharisees heard the crowd whispering these things about Jesus, they and the chief priests sent officers to arrest Him.",
    "John 7:33": "So Jesus said, “I am with you only a little while longer, and then I am going to the One who sent Me.",
    "John 7:34": "You will look for Me, but you will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come.”",
    "John 7:35": "At this, the Jews said to one another, “Where does He intend to go that we will not find Him? Will He go where the Jews are dispersed among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?",
    "John 7:36": "What does He mean by saying, ‘You will look for Me, but you will not find Me,’ and, ‘Where I am, you cannot come’?”",
    "John 7:37": "On the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood up and called out in a loud voice, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink.",
    "John 7:38": "Whoever believes in Me, as the Scripture has said: ‘Streams of living water will flow from within him.’”",
    "John 7:39": "He was speaking about the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were later to receive. For the Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.",
    "John 7:40": "On hearing these words, some of the people said, “This is truly the Prophet.”",
    "John 7:41": "Others declared, “This is the Christ.” But still others asked, “How can the Christ come from Galilee?",
    "John 7:42": "Doesn’t the Scripture say that the Christ will come from the line of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David lived?”",
    "John 7:43": "So there was division in the crowd because of Jesus.",
    "John 7:44": "Some of them wanted to seize Him, but no one laid a hand on Him.",
    "John 7:45": "Then the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, “Why didn’t you bring Him in?”",
    "John 7:46": "“Never has anyone spoken like this man!” the officers answered.",
    "John 7:47": "“Have you also been deceived?” replied the Pharisees.",
    "John 7:48": "“Have any of the rulers or Pharisees believed in Him?",
    "John 7:49": "But this crowd that does not know the law—they are under a curse.”",
    "John 7:50": "Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who himself was one of them, asked,",
    "John 7:51": "“Does our law convict a man without first hearing from him to determine what he has done?”",
    "John 7:52": "“Aren’t you also from Galilee?” they replied. “Look into it, and you will see that no prophet comes out of Galilee.”",
    "John 7:53": "Then each went to his own home.",
    "John 8:1": "But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.",
    "John 8:2": "Early in the morning He went back into the temple courts. All the people came to Him, and He sat down to teach them.",
    "John 8:3": "The scribes and Pharisees, however, brought to Him a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before them",
    "John 8:4": "and said, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.",
    "John 8:5": "In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such a woman. So what do You say?”",
    "John 8:6": "They said this to test Him, in order to have a basis for accusing Him. But Jesus bent down and began to write on the ground with His finger.",
    "John 8:7": "When they continued to question Him, He straightened up and said to them, “Let him who is without sin among you be the first to cast a stone at her.”",
    "John 8:8": "And again He bent down and wrote on the ground.",
    "John 8:9": "When they heard this, they began to go away one by one, beginning with the older ones, until only Jesus was left, with the woman standing there.",
    "John 8:10": "Then Jesus straightened up and asked her, “Woman, where are your accusers? Has no one condemned you?”",
    "John 8:11": "“No one, Lord,” she answered. “Then neither do I condemn you,” Jesus declared. “Now go and sin no more.”",
    "John 8:12": "Once again, Jesus spoke to the people and said, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows Me will never walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.”",
    "John 8:13": "So the Pharisees said to Him, “You are testifying about Yourself; Your testimony is not valid.”",
    "John 8:14": "Jesus replied, “Even if I testify about Myself, My testimony is valid, because I know where I came from and where I am going. But you do not know where I came from or where I am going.",
    "John 8:15": "You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.",
    "John 8:16": "But even if I do judge, My judgment is true, because I am not alone; I am with the Father who sent Me.",
    "John 8:17": "Even in your own Law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid.",
    "John 8:18": "I am One who testifies about Myself, and the Father, who sent Me, also testifies about Me.”",
    "John 8:19": "“Where is Your Father?” they asked Him. “You do not know Me or My Father,” Jesus answered. “If you knew Me, you would know My Father as well.”",
    "John 8:20": "He spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts, near the treasury. Yet no one seized Him, because His hour had not yet come.",
    "John 8:21": "Again He said to them, “I am going away, and you will look for Me, but you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.”",
    "John 8:22": "So the Jews began to ask, “Will He kill Himself, since He says, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come’?”",
    "John 8:23": "Then He told them, “You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.",
    "John 8:24": "That is why I told you that you would die in your sins. For unless you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.”",
    "John 8:25": "“Who are You?” they asked. “Just what I have been telling you from the beginning,” Jesus replied.",
    "John 8:26": "“I have much to say about you and much to judge. But the One who sent Me is truthful, and what I have heard from Him, I tell the world.”",
    "John 8:27": "They did not understand that He was telling them about the Father.",
    "John 8:28": "So Jesus said, “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do nothing on My own, but speak exactly what the Father has taught Me.",
    "John 8:29": "He who sent Me is with Me. He has not left Me alone, because I always do what pleases Him.”",
    "John 8:30": "As Jesus spoke these things, many believed in Him.",
    "John 8:31": "So He said to the Jews who had believed Him, “If you continue in My word, you are truly My disciples.",
    "John 8:32": "Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”",
    "John 8:33": "“We are Abraham’s descendants,” they answered. “We have never been slaves to anyone. How can You say we will be set free?”",
    "John 8:34": "Jesus replied, “Truly, truly, I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.",
    "John 8:35": "A slave does not remain in the house forever, but a son remains forever.",
    "John 8:36": "So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.",
    "John 8:37": "I know you are Abraham’s descendants, but you are trying to kill Me because My word has no place within you.",
    "John 8:38": "I speak of what I have seen in the presence of the Father, and you do what you have heard from your father.”",
    "John 8:39": "“Abraham is our father,” they replied. “If you were children of Abraham,” said Jesus, “you would do the works of Abraham.",
    "John 8:40": "But now you are trying to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham never did such a thing.",
    "John 8:41": "You are doing the works of your father.” “We are not illegitimate children,” they declared. “Our only Father is God Himself.”",
    "John 8:42": "Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on My own, but He sent Me.",
    "John 8:43": "Why do you not understand what I am saying? It is because you are unable to accept My message.",
    "John 8:44": "You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out his desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, refusing to uphold the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, because he is a liar and the father of lies.",
    "John 8:45": "But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me!",
    "John 8:46": "Which of you can prove Me guilty of sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe Me?",
    "John 8:47": "Whoever belongs to God hears the words of God. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.”",
    "John 8:48": "The Jews answered Him, “Are we not right to say that You are a Samaritan and You have a demon?”",
    "John 8:49": "“I do not have a demon,” Jesus replied, “but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me.",
    "John 8:50": "I do not seek My own glory. There is One who seeks it, and He is the Judge.",
    "John 8:51": "Truly, truly, I tell you, if anyone keeps My word, he will never see death.”",
    "John 8:52": "“Now we know that You have a demon!” declared the Jews. “Abraham died, and so did the prophets, yet You say that anyone who keeps Your word will never taste death.",
    "John 8:53": "Are You greater than our father Abraham? He died, as did the prophets. Who do You claim to be?”",
    "John 8:54": "Jesus answered, “If I glorify Myself, My glory means nothing. The One who glorifies Me is My Father, of whom you say, ‘He is our God.’",
    "John 8:55": "You do not know Him, but I know Him. If I said I did not know Him, I would be a liar like you. But I do know Him, and I keep His word.",
    "John 8:56": "Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see My day. He saw it and was glad.”",
    "John 8:57": "Then the Jews said to Him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and You have seen Abraham?”",
    "John 8:58": "“Truly, truly, I tell you,” Jesus declared, “before Abraham was born, I am!”",
    "John 8:59": "At this, they picked up stones to throw at Him. But Jesus was hidden and went out of the temple area.",
    "John 9:1": "Now as Jesus was passing by, He saw a man blind from birth,",
    "John 9:2": "and His disciples asked Him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”",
    "John 9:3": "Jesus answered, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but this happened so that the works of God would be displayed in him.",
    "John 9:4": "While it is daytime, we must do the works of Him who sent Me. Night is coming, when no one can work.",
    "John 9:5": "While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”",
    "John 9:6": "When Jesus had said this, He spit on the ground, made some mud, and applied it to the man’s eyes.",
    "John 9:7": "Then He told him, “Go, wash in the Pool of Siloam” (which means “Sent”). So the man went and washed, and came back seeing.",
    "John 9:8": "At this, his neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging began to ask, “Isn’t this the man who used to sit and beg?”",
    "John 9:9": "Some claimed that he was, but others said, “No, he just looks like him.” But the man kept saying, “I am the one.”",
    "John 9:10": "“How then were your eyes opened?” they asked.",
    "John 9:11": "He answered, “The man they call Jesus made some mud and anointed my eyes, and He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed and received my sight.”",
    "John 9:12": "“Where is He?” they asked. “I do not know,” he answered.",
    "John 9:13": "They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind.",
    "John 9:14": "Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened his eyes was a Sabbath.",
    "John 9:15": "So the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. The man answered, “He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and now I can see.”",
    "John 9:16": "Because of this, some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, for He does not keep the Sabbath.” But others said, “How can a sinful man perform such signs?” And there was division among them.",
    "John 9:17": "So once again they asked the man who had been blind, “What do you say about Him, since it was your eyes He opened?” “He is a prophet,” the man replied.",
    "John 9:18": "The Jews still did not believe that the man had been blind and had received his sight until they summoned his parents",
    "John 9:19": "and asked, “Is this your son, the one you say was born blind? So how is it that he can now see?”",
    "John 9:20": "His parents answered, “We know he is our son, and we know he was born blind.",
    "John 9:21": "But how he can now see or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him. He is old enough to speak for himself.”",
    "John 9:22": "His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews. For the Jews had already determined that anyone who confessed Jesus as the Christ would be put out of the synagogue.",
    "John 9:23": "That was why his parents said, “He is old enough. Ask him.”",
    "John 9:24": "So a second time they called for the man who had been blind and said, “Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner.”",
    "John 9:25": "He answered, “Whether He is a sinner I do not know. There is one thing I do know: I was blind, but now I see!”",
    "John 9:26": "“What did He do to you?” they asked. “How did He open your eyes?”",
    "John 9:27": "He replied, “I already told you, and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become His disciples?”",
    "John 9:28": "Then they heaped insults on him and said, “You are His disciple; we are disciples of Moses.",
    "John 9:29": "We know that God spoke to Moses, but we do not know where this man is from.”",
    "John 9:30": "“That is remarkable indeed!” the man said. “You do not know where He is from, and yet He opened my eyes.",
    "John 9:31": "We know that God does not listen to sinners, but He does listen to the one who worships Him and does His will.",
    "John 9:32": "Never before has anyone heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind.",
    "John 9:33": "If this man were not from God, He could do no such thing.”",
    "John 9:34": "They replied, “You were born in utter sin, and you are instructing us?” And they threw him out.",
    "John 9:35": "When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, He found the man and said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”",
    "John 9:36": "“Who is He, Sir?” he replied. “Tell me so that I may believe in Him.”",
    "John 9:37": "“You have already seen Him,” Jesus answered. “He is the One speaking with you.”",
    "John 9:38": "“Lord, I believe,” he said. And he worshiped Jesus.",
    "John 9:39": "Then Jesus declared, “For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind may see and those who see may become blind.”",
    "John 9:40": "Some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard this, and they asked Him, “Are we blind too?”",
    "John 9:41": "“If you were blind,” Jesus replied, “you would not be guilty of sin. But since you claim you can see, your guilt remains.”",
    "John 10:1": "“Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever does not enter the sheepfold by the gate, but climbs in some other way, is a thief and a robber.",
    "John 10:2": "But the one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.",
    "John 10:3": "The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen for his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.",
    "John 10:4": "When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice.",
    "John 10:5": "But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will flee from him because they do not recognize his voice.”",
    "John 10:6": "Jesus spoke to them using this illustration, but they did not understand what He was telling them.",
    "John 10:7": "So He said to them again, “Truly, truly, I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep.",
    "John 10:8": "All who came before Me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.",
    "John 10:9": "I am the gate. If anyone enters through Me, he will be saved. He will come in and go out and find pasture.",
    "John 10:10": "The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I have come that they may have life, and have it in all its fullness.",
    "John 10:11": "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.",
    "John 10:12": "The hired hand is not the shepherd, and the sheep are not his own. When he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf pounces on them and scatters the flock.",
    "John 10:13": "The man runs away because he is a hired servant and is unconcerned for the sheep.",
    "John 10:14": "I am the good shepherd. I know My sheep and My sheep know Me,",
    "John 10:15": "just as the Father knows Me and I know the Father. And I lay down My life for the sheep.",
    "John 10:16": "I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them in as well, and they will listen to My voice. Then there will be one flock and one shepherd.",
    "John 10:17": "The reason the Father loves Me is that I lay down My life in order to take it up again.",
    "John 10:18": "No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of My own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from My Father.”",
    "John 10:19": "Again there was division among the Jews because of Jesus’ message.",
    "John 10:20": "Many of them said, “He is demon-possessed and insane. Why would you listen to Him?”",
    "John 10:21": "But others replied, “These are not the words of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”",
    "John 10:22": "At that time the Feast of Dedication took place in Jerusalem. It was winter,",
    "John 10:23": "and Jesus was walking in the temple courts in Solomon’s Colonnade.",
    "John 10:24": "So the Jews gathered around Him and demanded, “How long will You keep us in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.”",
    "John 10:25": "“I already told you,” Jesus replied, “but you did not believe. The works I do in My Father’s name testify on My behalf.",
    "John 10:26": "But because you are not My sheep, you refuse to believe.",
    "John 10:27": "My sheep listen to My voice; I know them, and they follow Me.",
    "John 10:28": "I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one can snatch them out of My hand.",
    "John 10:29": "My Father who has given them to Me is greater than all. No one can snatch them out of My Father’s hand.",
    "John 10:30": "I and the Father are one.”",
    "John 10:31": "At this, the Jews again picked up stones to stone Him.",
    "John 10:32": "But Jesus responded, “I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone Me?”",
    "John 10:33": "“We are not stoning You for any good work,” said the Jews, “but for blasphemy, because You, who are a man, make Yourself out to be God.”",
    "John 10:34": "Jesus replied, “Is it not written in your Law: ‘I have said you are gods’?",
    "John 10:35": "If he called them gods to whom the word of God came—and the Scripture cannot be broken—",
    "John 10:36": "then what about the One whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world? How then can you accuse Me of blasphemy for stating that I am the Son of God?",
    "John 10:37": "If I am not doing the works of My Father, then do not believe Me.",
    "John 10:38": "But if I am doing them, even though you do not believe Me, believe the works themselves, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in Me, and I am in the Father.”",
    "John 10:39": "At this, they tried again to seize Him, but He escaped their grasp.",
    "John 10:40": "Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had first been baptizing, and He stayed there.",
    "John 10:41": "Many came to Him and said, “Although John never performed a sign, everything he said about this man was true.”",
    "John 10:42": "And many in that place believed in Jesus.",
    "John 11:1": "At this time a man named Lazarus was sick. He lived in Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.",
    "John 11:2": "(Mary, whose brother Lazarus was sick, was to anoint the Lord with perfume and wipe His feet with her hair.)",
    "John 11:3": "So the sisters sent word to Jesus, “Lord, the one You love is sick.”",
    "John 11:4": "When Jesus heard this, He said, “This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”",
    "John 11:5": "Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.",
    "John 11:6": "So on hearing that Lazarus was sick, He stayed where He was for two days,",
    "John 11:7": "and then He said to the disciples, “Let us go back to Judea.”",
    "John 11:8": "“Rabbi,” they replied, “the Jews just tried to stone You, and You are going back there?”",
    "John 11:9": "Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours of daylight? If anyone walks in the daytime, he will not stumble, because he sees by the light of this world.",
    "John 11:10": "But if anyone walks at night, he will stumble, because he has no light.”",
    "John 11:11": "After He had said this, He told them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going there to wake him up.”",
    "John 11:12": "His disciples replied, “Lord, if he is sleeping, he will get better.”",
    "John 11:13": "They thought that Jesus was talking about actual sleep, but He was speaking about the death of Lazarus.",
    "John 11:14": "So Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead,",
    "John 11:15": "and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.”",
    "John 11:16": "Then Thomas called Didymus said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, so that we may die with Him.”",
    "John 11:17": "When Jesus arrived, He found that Lazarus had already spent four days in the tomb.",
    "John 11:18": "Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, a little less than two miles away,",
    "John 11:19": "and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them in the loss of their brother.",
    "John 11:20": "So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet Him, but Mary stayed at home.",
    "John 11:21": "Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.",
    "John 11:22": "But even now I know that God will give You whatever You ask of Him.”",
    "John 11:23": "“Your brother will rise again,” Jesus told her.",
    "John 11:24": "Martha replied, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”",
    "John 11:25": "Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in Me will live, even though he dies.",
    "John 11:26": "And everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this?”",
    "John 11:27": "“Yes, Lord,” she answered, “I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.”",
    "John 11:28": "After Martha had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside to tell her, “The Teacher is here and is asking for you.”",
    "John 11:29": "And when Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to Him.",
    "John 11:30": "Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met Him.",
    "John 11:31": "When the Jews who were in the house consoling Mary saw how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there.",
    "John 11:32": "When Mary came to Jesus and saw Him, she fell at His feet and said, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.”",
    "John 11:33": "When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, He was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.",
    "John 11:34": "“Where have you put him?” He asked. “Come and see, Lord,” they answered.",
    "John 11:35": "Jesus wept.",
    "John 11:36": "Then the Jews said, “See how He loved him!”",
    "John 11:37": "But some of them asked, “Could not this man who opened the eyes of the blind also have kept Lazarus from dying?”",
    "John 11:38": "Jesus, once again deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance.",
    "John 11:39": "“Take away the stone,” Jesus said. “Lord, by now he stinks,” said Martha, the sister of the dead man. “It has already been four days.”",
    "John 11:40": "Jesus replied, “Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?”",
    "John 11:41": "So they took away the stone. Then Jesus lifted His eyes upward and said, “Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.",
    "John 11:42": "I knew that You always hear Me, but I say this for the benefit of the people standing here, so they may believe that You sent Me.”",
    "John 11:43": "After Jesus had said this, He called out in a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!”",
    "John 11:44": "The man who had been dead came out with his hands and feet bound in strips of linen, and his face wrapped in a cloth. “Unwrap him and let him go,” Jesus told them.",
    "John 11:45": "Therefore many of the Jews who had come to Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, believed in Him.",
    "John 11:46": "But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.",
    "John 11:47": "Then the chief priests and Pharisees convened the Sanhedrin and said, “What are we to do? This man is performing many signs.",
    "John 11:48": "If we let Him go on like this, everyone will believe in Him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.”",
    "John 11:49": "But one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing at all!",
    "John 11:50": "You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.”",
    "John 11:51": "Caiaphas did not say this on his own. Instead, as high priest that year, he was prophesying that Jesus would die for the nation,",
    "John 11:52": "and not only for the nation, but also for the scattered children of God, to gather them together into one.",
    "John 11:53": "So from that day on they plotted to kill Him.",
    "John 11:54": "As a result, Jesus no longer went about publicly among the Jews, but He withdrew to a town called Ephraim in an area near the wilderness. And He stayed there with the disciples.",
    "John 11:55": "Now the Jewish Passover was near, and many people went up from the country to Jerusalem to purify themselves before the Passover.",
    "John 11:56": "They kept looking for Jesus and asking one another as they stood in the temple courts, “What do you think? Will He come to the feast at all?”",
    "John 11:57": "But the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where He was must report it, so that they could arrest Him.",
    "John 12:1": "Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, the hometown of Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead.",

    "John 12:3": "Then Mary took about a pint of expensive perfume, made of pure nard, and she anointed Jesus’ feet and wiped them with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.",
    "John 12:4": "But one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was going to betray Him, asked,",
    "John 12:5": "“Why wasn’t this perfume sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?”",
    "John 12:6": "Judas did not say this because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief. As keeper of the money bag, he used to take from what was put into it.",
    "John 12:7": "“Leave her alone,” Jesus replied. “She has kept this perfume in preparation for the day of My burial.",
    "John 12:8": "The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have Me.”",
    "John 12:9": "Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews learned that Jesus was there. And they came not only because of Him, but also to see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead.",

    "John 12:17": "Meanwhile, many people who had been with Jesus when He called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to testify.",
    "John 12:18": "That is also why the crowd went out to meet Him, because they heard that He had performed this sign.",
    "John 12:19": "Then the Pharisees said to one another, “You can see that this is doing you no good. Look how the whole world has gone after Him!”",

    "John 12:27": "Now My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, save Me from this hour’? No, it is for this purpose that I have come to this hour.",
    "John 12:28": "Father, glorify Your name!” Then a voice came from heaven: “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.”",
    "John 12:29": "The crowd standing there heard it and said that it had thundered. Others said that an angel had spoken to Him.",
    "John 12:30": "In response, Jesus said, “This voice was not for My benefit, but yours.",
    "John 12:31": "Now judgment is upon this world; now the prince of this world will be cast out.",
    "John 12:32": "And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw everyone to Myself.”",
    "John 12:33": "He said this to indicate the kind of death He was going to die.",
    "John 12:34": "The crowd replied, “We have heard from the Law that the Christ will remain forever. So how can You say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?”",
    "John 12:35": "Then Jesus told them, “For a little while longer, the Light will be among you. Walk while you have the Light, so that darkness will not overtake you. The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.",

    "John 12:37": "Although Jesus had performed so many signs in their presence, they still did not believe in Him.",
    "John 12:38": "This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: “Lord, who has believed our message? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”",
    "John 12:39": "For this reason they were unable to believe. For again, Isaiah says:",
    "John 12:40": "“He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, so that they cannot see with their eyes, and understand with their hearts, and turn, and I would heal them.”",
    "John 12:41": "Isaiah said these things because he saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about Him.",
    "John 12:42": "Nevertheless, many of the leaders believed in Him. But because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, for fear that they would be put out of the synagogue.",
    "John 12:43": "For they loved praise from men more than praise from God.",
    "John 12:44": "Then Jesus cried out, “Whoever believes in Me does not believe in Me alone, but in the One who sent Me.",
    "John 12:45": "And whoever sees Me sees the One who sent Me.",

    "John 13:3": "Jesus knew that the Father had delivered all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and was returning to God.",
    "John 13:4": "So He got up from the supper, laid aside His outer garments, and wrapped a towel around His waist.",
    "John 13:5": "After that, He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and dry them with the towel that was around Him.",
    "John 13:6": "He came to Simon Peter, who asked Him, “Lord, are You going to wash my feet?”",

    "John 13:10": "Jesus told him, “Whoever has already bathed needs only to wash his feet, and he will be completely clean. And you are clean, though not all of you.”",

    "John 13:13": "You call Me Teacher and Lord, and rightly so, because I am.",
    "John 13:14": "So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another’s feet.",
    "John 13:15": "I have set you an example so that you should do as I have done for you.",

    "John 13:26": "Jesus answered, “It is the one to whom I give this morsel after I have dipped it.” Then He dipped the morsel and gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot.",
    "John 13:27": "And when Judas had taken the morsel, Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to Judas, “What you are about to do, do quickly.”",
    "John 13:28": "But no one at the table knew why Jesus had said this to him.",
    "John 13:29": "Since Judas kept the money bag, some thought that Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the feast, or to give something to the poor.",
    "John 13:30": "As soon as he had received the morsel, Judas went out into the night.",
    "John 13:31": "When Judas had gone out, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in Him.",

    "John 17:17": "Sanctify them by the truth; Your word is truth.",
    "John 17:18": "As You sent Me into the world, I have also sent them into the world.",
    "John 17:19": "For them I sanctify Myself, so that they too may be sanctified by the truth.",
    "John 17:20": "I am not asking on behalf of them alone, but also on behalf of those who will believe in Me through their message,",
    "John 17:21": "that all of them may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I am in You. May they also be in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me.",
    "John 17:22": "I have given them the glory You gave Me, so that they may be one as We are one—",
    "John 17:23": "I in them and You in Me—that they may be perfectly united, so that the world may know that You sent Me and have loved them just as You have loved Me.",
    "John 17:24": "Father, I want those You have given Me to be with Me where I am, that they may see the glory You gave Me because You loved Me before the foundation of the world.",
    "John 17:25": "Righteous Father, although the world has not known You, I know You, and they know that You sent Me.",
    "John 17:26": "And I have made Your name known to them and will continue to make it known, so that the love You have for Me may be in them, and I in them.”",
    "John 18:1": "After Jesus had spoken these words, He went out with His disciples across the Kidron Valley, where they entered a garden.",
    "John 18:2": "Now Judas His betrayer also knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with His disciples.",
    "John 18:3": "So Judas brought a band of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees. They arrived at the garden carrying lanterns, torches, and weapons.",
    "John 18:4": "Jesus, knowing all that was coming upon Him, stepped forward and asked them, “Whom are you seeking?”",
    "John 18:5": "“Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered. Jesus said, “I am He.” And Judas His betrayer was standing there with them.",
    "John 18:6": "When Jesus said, “I am He,” they drew back and fell to the ground.",
    "John 18:7": "So He asked them again, “Whom are you seeking?” “Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered.",
    "John 18:8": "“I told you that I am He,” Jesus replied. “So if you are looking for Me, let these men go.”",
    "John 18:9": "This was to fulfill the word He had spoken: “I have not lost one of those You have given Me.”",
    "John 18:10": "Then Simon Peter drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.",
    "John 18:11": "“Put your sword back in its sheath!” Jesus said to Peter. “Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given Me?”",
    "John 18:12": "Then the band of soldiers, with its commander and the officers of the Jews, arrested Jesus and bound Him.",
    "John 18:13": "They brought Him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.",
    "John 18:14": "Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it would be better if one man died for the people.",
    "John 18:15": "Now Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he also went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest.",
    "John 18:16": "But Peter stood outside at the door. Then the disciple who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to the doorkeeper, and brought Peter in.",
    "John 18:17": "At this, the servant girl watching the door said to Peter, “Aren’t you also one of this man’s disciples?” “I am not,” he answered.",
    "John 18:18": "Because it was cold, the servants and officers were standing around a charcoal fire they had made to keep warm. And Peter was also standing with them, warming himself.",
    "John 18:19": "Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about His disciples and His teaching.",
    "John 18:20": "“I have spoken openly to the world,” Jesus answered. “I always taught in the synagogues and at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret.",
    "John 18:21": "Why are you asking Me? Ask those who heard My message. Surely they know what I said.”",
    "John 18:22": "When Jesus had said this, one of the officers standing nearby slapped Him in the face and said, “Is this how You answer the high priest?”",
    "John 18:23": "Jesus replied, “If I said something wrong, testify as to what was wrong. But if I spoke correctly, why did you strike Me?”",
    "John 18:24": "Then Annas sent Him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest.",
    "John 18:25": "Simon Peter was still standing and warming himself. So they asked him, “Aren’t you also one of His disciples?” He denied it and said, “I am not.”",
    "John 18:26": "One of the high priest’s servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, “Didn’t I see you with Him in the garden?”",
    "John 18:27": "Peter denied it once more, and immediately a rooster crowed.",
    "John 18:28": "Then they led Jesus away from Caiaphas into the Praetorium. By now it was early morning, and the Jews did not enter the Praetorium, to avoid being defiled and unable to eat the Passover.",
    "John 18:29": "So Pilate went out to them and asked, “What accusation are you bringing against this man?”",
    "John 18:30": "“If He were not a criminal,” they replied, “we would not have handed Him over to you.”",
    "John 18:31": "“You take Him and judge Him by your own law,” Pilate told them. “We are not permitted to execute anyone,” the Jews replied.",
    "John 18:32": "This was to fulfill the word that Jesus had spoken to indicate the kind of death He was going to die.",
    "John 18:33": "Pilate went back into the Praetorium, summoned Jesus, and asked Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?”",
    "John 18:34": "“Are you saying this on your own,” Jesus asked, “or did others tell you about Me?”",
    "John 18:35": "“Am I a Jew?” Pilate replied. “Your own people and chief priests handed You over to me. What have You done?”",
    "John 18:36": "Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world; if it were, My servants would fight to prevent My arrest by the Jews. But now My kingdom is not of this realm.”",
    "John 18:37": "“Then You are a king!” Pilate said. “You say that I am a king,” Jesus answered. “For this reason I was born and have come into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to My voice.”",
    "John 18:38": "“What is truth?” Pilate asked. And having said this, he went out again to the Jews and told them, “I find no basis for a charge against Him.",
    "John 18:39": "But it is your custom that I release to you one prisoner at the Passover. So then, do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”",
    "John 18:40": "“Not this man,” they shouted, “but Barabbas!” (Now Barabbas was an insurrectionist.)",
    "John 19:1": "Then Pilate took Jesus and had Him flogged.",
    "John 19:2": "The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns, set it on His head, and dressed Him in a purple robe.",
    "John 19:3": "And they went up to Him again and again, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and slapping Him in the face.",
    "John 19:4": "Once again Pilate came out and said to the Jews, “Look, I am bringing Him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against Him.”",
    "John 19:5": "When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!”",
    "John 19:6": "As soon as the chief priests and officers saw Him, they shouted, “Crucify Him! Crucify Him!” “You take Him and crucify Him,” Pilate replied, “for I find no basis for a charge against Him.”",
    "John 19:7": "“We have a law,” answered the Jews, “and according to that law He must die, because He declared Himself to be the Son of God.”",
    "John 19:8": "When Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid,",
    "John 19:9": "and he went back into the Praetorium. “Where are You from?” he asked. But Jesus gave no answer.",
    "John 19:10": "So Pilate said to Him, “Do You refuse to speak to me? Do You not know that I have authority to release You and authority to crucify You?”",
    "John 19:11": "Jesus answered, “You would have no authority over Me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed Me over to you is guilty of greater sin.”",
    "John 19:12": "From then on, Pilate tried to release Him, but the Jews kept shouting, “If you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who declares himself a king is defying Caesar.”",
    "John 19:13": "When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat on the judgment seat at a place called the Stone Pavement, which in Hebrew is Gabbatha.",
    "John 19:14": "It was the day of Preparation for the Passover, about the sixth hour. And Pilate said to the Jews, “Here is your King!”",
    "John 19:15": "At this, they shouted, “Away with Him! Away with Him! Crucify Him!” “Shall I crucify your King?” Pilate asked. “We have no king but Caesar,” replied the chief priests.",
    "John 19:16": "Then Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified, and the soldiers took Him away.",
    "John 19:17": "Carrying His own cross, He went out to The Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha.",
    "John 19:18": "There they crucified Him, and with Him two others, one on each side, with Jesus in the middle.",
    "John 19:19": "Pilate also had a notice posted on the cross. It read: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.",
    "John 19:20": "Many of the Jews read this sign, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.",
    "John 19:21": "So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but only that He said, ‘I am the King of the Jews.’”",
    "John 19:22": "Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”",
    "John 19:23": "When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they divided His garments into four parts, one for each soldier, with the tunic remaining. It was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.",
    "John 19:24": "So they said to one another, “Let us not tear it. Instead, let us cast lots to see who will get it.” This was to fulfill the Scripture: “They divided My garments among them, and cast lots for My clothing.” So that is what the soldiers did.",
    "John 19:25": "Near the cross of Jesus stood His mother and her sister, as well as Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary Magdalene.",
    "John 19:26": "When Jesus saw His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby, He said to His mother, “Woman, here is your son.”",
    "John 19:27": "Then He said to the disciple, “Here is your mother.” So from that hour, this disciple took her into his home.",
    "John 19:28": "After this, knowing that everything had now been accomplished, and to fulfill the Scripture, Jesus said, “I am thirsty.”",
    "John 19:29": "A jar of sour wine was sitting there. So they soaked a sponge in the wine, put it on a stalk of hyssop, and lifted it to His mouth.",
    "John 19:30": "When Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, “It is finished.” And bowing His head, He yielded up His spirit.",
    "John 19:31": "It was the day of Preparation, and the next day was a High Sabbath. In order that the bodies would not remain on the cross during the Sabbath, the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed.",
    "John 19:32": "So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and those of the other.",
    "John 19:33": "But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.",
    "John 19:34": "Instead, one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water flowed out.",
    "John 19:35": "The one who saw it has testified to this, and his testimony is true. He knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe.",
    "John 19:36": "Now these things happened so that the Scripture would be fulfilled: “Not one of His bones will be broken.”",
    "John 19:37": "And, as another Scripture says: “They will look on the One they have pierced.”",
    "John 19:38": "Afterward, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus (but secretly for fear of the Jews), asked Pilate to let him remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission, so he came and removed His body.",
    "John 19:39": "Nicodemus, who had previously come to Jesus at night, also brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds.",
    "John 19:40": "So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, according to the Jewish burial custom.",
    "John 19:41": "Now there was a garden in the place where Jesus was crucified, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.",
    "John 19:42": "And because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and the tomb was nearby, they placed Jesus there.",
    "John 20:1": "Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.",
    "John 20:2": "So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved. “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb,” she said, “and we do not know where they have put Him!”",
    "John 20:3": "Then Peter and the other disciple set out for the tomb.",
    "John 20:4": "The two were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.",
    "John 20:5": "He bent down and looked in at the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in.",
    "John 20:6": "Simon Peter arrived just after him. He entered the tomb and saw the linen cloths lying there.",
    "John 20:7": "The cloth that had been around Jesus’ head was rolled up, lying separate from the linen cloths.",
    "John 20:8": "Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went in. And he saw and believed.",
    "John 20:9": "For they still did not understand from the Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.",
    "John 20:10": "Then the disciples returned to their homes.",
    "John 20:11": "But Mary stood outside the tomb weeping. And as she wept, she bent down to look into the tomb,",
    "John 20:12": "and she saw two angels in white sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and the other at the feet.",
    "John 20:13": "“Woman, why are you weeping?” they asked. “Because they have taken my Lord away,” she said, “and I do not know where they have put Him.”",
    "John 20:14": "When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there. But she did not recognize that it was Jesus.",
    "John 20:15": "“Woman, why are you weeping?” Jesus asked. “Whom are you seeking?” Thinking He was the gardener, she said, “Sir, if you have carried Him off, tell me where you have put Him, and I will get Him.”",
    "John 20:16": "Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned and said to Him in Hebrew, “Rabboni!” (which means “Teacher”).",
    "John 20:17": "“Do not cling to Me,” Jesus said, “for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go and tell My brothers, ‘I am ascending to My Father and your Father, to My God and your God.’”",
    "John 20:18": "Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord!” And she told them what He had said to her.",
    "John 20:19": "It was the first day of the week, and that very evening, while the disciples were together with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them. “Peace be with you!” He said to them.",
    "John 20:20": "After He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. The disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.",
    "John 20:21": "Again Jesus said to them, “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent Me, so also I am sending you.”",
    "John 20:22": "When He had said this, He breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit.",
    "John 20:23": "If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you withhold forgiveness from anyone, it is withheld.”",
    "John 20:24": "Now Thomas called Didymus, one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came.",
    "John 20:25": "So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!” But he replied, “Unless I see the nail marks in His hands, and put my finger where the nails have been, and put my hand into His side, I will never believe.”",
    "John 20:26": "Eight days later, His disciples were once again inside with the doors locked, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.”",
    "John 20:27": "Then Jesus said to Thomas, “Put your finger here and look at My hands. Reach out your hand and put it into My side. Stop doubting and believe.”",
    "John 20:28": "Thomas replied, “My Lord and my God!”",
    "John 20:29": "Jesus said to him, “Because you have seen Me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”",
    "John 20:30": "Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book.",
    "John 20:31": "But these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in His name.",
    "John 21:1": "Later, by the Sea of Tiberias, Jesus again revealed Himself to the disciples. He made Himself known in this way:",
    "John 21:2": "Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together.",
    "John 21:3": "Simon Peter told them, “I am going fishing.” “We will go with you,” they said. So they went out and got into the boat, but caught nothing that night.",
    "John 21:4": "Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not recognize that it was Jesus.",
    "John 21:5": "So He called out to them, “Children, do you have any fish?” “No,” they answered.",
    "John 21:6": "He told them, “Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” So they cast it there, and they were unable to haul it in because of the great number of fish.",
    "John 21:7": "Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” As soon as Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he had removed it) and jumped into the sea.",
    "John 21:8": "The other disciples came ashore in the boat. They dragged in the net full of fish, for they were not far from land, only about a hundred yards.",
    "John 21:9": "When they landed, they saw a charcoal fire there with fish on it, and some bread.",
    "John 21:10": "Jesus told them, “Bring some of the fish you have just caught.”",
    "John 21:11": "So Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many, the net was not torn.",
    "John 21:12": "“Come, have breakfast,” Jesus said to them. None of the disciples dared to ask Him, “Who are You?” They knew it was the Lord.",

    "John 21:17": "Jesus asked a third time, “Simon son of John, do you love Me?” Peter was deeply hurt that Jesus had asked him a third time, “Do you love Me?” “Lord, You know all things,” he replied. “You know I love You.” Jesus said to him, “Feed My sheep.",
    "John 21:18": "Truly, truly, I tell you, when you were young, you dressed yourself and walked where you wanted; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.”",

    "John 21:22": "Jesus answered, “If I want him to remain until I return, what is that to you? You follow Me!”",
    "John 21:23": "Because of this, the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die. However, Jesus did not say that he would not die, but only, “If I want him to remain until I return, what is that to you?”",
    "John 21:24": "This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who has written them down. And we know that his testimony is true.",

    "Acts 19:26": "And you can see and hear that not only in Ephesus, but in nearly the whole province of Asia, this Paul has persuaded a great number of people to turn away. He says that man-made gods are no gods at all.",

    "Acts 19:36": "Since these things are undeniable, you ought to be calm and not do anything rash.",
    "Acts 19:37": "For you have brought these men here, though they have neither robbed our temple nor blasphemed our goddess.",
    "Acts 19:38": "So if Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open and proconsuls are available. Let them bring charges against one another there.",
    "Acts 19:39": "But if you are seeking anything beyond this, it must be settled in a legal assembly.",

    "Acts 26:9": "So then, I too was convinced that I ought to do all I could to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.",
    "Acts 26:10": "And that is what I did in Jerusalem. With authority from the chief priests I put many of the saints in prison, and when they were condemned to death, I cast my vote against them.",
    "Acts 26:11": "I frequently had them punished in the synagogues, and I tried to make them blaspheme. In my raging fury against them, I even went to foreign cities to persecute them.",
    "Acts 26:12": "In this pursuit I was on my way to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests.",

    "Acts 26:30": "Then the king and the governor rose, along with Bernice and those seated with them.",
    "Acts 26:31": "On their way out, they said to one another, “This man has done nothing worthy of death or imprisonment.”",

    "Acts 27:12": "Since the harbor was unsuitable to winter in, the majority decided to sail on, hoping that somehow they could reach Phoenix to winter there. Phoenix was a harbor in Crete facing both southwest and northwest.",

    "Romans 1:24": "Therefore God gave them over in the desires of their hearts to impurity for the dishonoring of their bodies with one another.",
    "Romans 1:25": "They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is forever worthy of praise! Amen.",
    "Romans 1:26": "For this reason God gave them over to dishonorable passions. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.",
    "Romans 1:27": "Likewise, the men abandoned natural relations with women and burned with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.",
    "Romans 1:28": "Furthermore, since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, He gave them up to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.",
    "Romans 1:29": "They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed, and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and malice. They are gossips,",
    "Romans 1:30": "slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant, and boastful. They invent new forms of evil; they disobey their parents.",
    "Romans 1:31": "They are senseless, faithless, heartless, merciless.",
    "Romans 1:32": "Although they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such things are worthy of death, they not only continue to do these things, but also approve of those who practice them.",
    "Romans 2:1": "You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on another. For on whatever grounds you judge the other, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things.",
    "Romans 2:2": "And we know that God’s judgment against those who do such things is based on truth.",
    "Romans 2:3": "So when you, O man, pass judgment on others, yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God’s judgment?",
    "Romans 2:4": "Or do you disregard the riches of His kindness, tolerance, and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness leads you to repentance?",
    "Romans 2:5": "But because of your hard and unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of wrath, when God’s righteous judgment will be revealed.",
    "Romans 2:6": "God “will repay each one according to his deeds.”",
    "Romans 2:7": "To those who by perseverance in doing good seek glory, honor, and immortality, He will give eternal life.",
    "Romans 2:8": "But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow wickedness, there will be wrath and anger.",
    "Romans 2:9": "There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil, first for the Jew, then for the Greek;",
    "Romans 2:10": "but glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does good, first for the Jew, then for the Greek.",
    "Romans 2:11": "For God does not show favoritism.",
    "Romans 2:12": "All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.",
    "Romans 2:13": "For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but it is the doers of the law who will be declared righteous.",
    "Romans 2:14": "Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.",
    "Romans 2:15": "So they show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts either accusing or defending them",
    "Romans 2:16": "on the day when God will judge men’s secrets through Christ Jesus, as proclaimed by my gospel.",
    "Romans 2:17": "Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if you rely on the law and boast in God;",
    "Romans 2:18": "if you know His will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law;",
    "Romans 2:19": "if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those in darkness,",
    "Romans 2:20": "an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth—",
    "Romans 2:21": "you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?",
    "Romans 2:22": "You who forbid adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?",
    "Romans 2:23": "You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?",
    "Romans 2:24": "As it is written: “God’s name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”",
    "Romans 2:25": "Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.",
    "Romans 2:26": "If a man who is not circumcised keeps the requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?",
    "Romans 2:27": "The one who is physically uncircumcised yet keeps the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker.",
    "Romans 2:28": "A man is not a Jew because he is one outwardly, nor is circumcision only outward and physical.",
    "Romans 2:29": "No, a man is a Jew because he is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a man’s praise does not come from men, but from God.",
    "Romans 3:1": "What, then, is the advantage of being a Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision?",
    "Romans 3:2": "Much in every way. First of all, they have been entrusted with the very words of God.",
    "Romans 3:3": "What if some did not have faith? Will their lack of faith nullify God’s faithfulness?",
    "Romans 3:4": "Certainly not! Let God be true and every man a liar. As it is written: “So that You may be proved right when You speak and victorious when You judge.”",
    "Romans 3:5": "But if our unrighteousness highlights the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unjust to inflict His wrath on us? I am speaking in human terms.",
    "Romans 3:6": "Certainly not! In that case, how could God judge the world?",
    "Romans 3:7": "However, if my falsehood accentuates God’s truthfulness, to the increase of His glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?",
    "Romans 3:8": "Why not say, as some slanderously claim that we say, “Let us do evil that good may result”? Their condemnation is deserved!",
    "Romans 3:9": "What then? Are we any better? Not at all. For we have already made the charge that Jews and Greeks alike are all under sin.",
    "Romans 3:10": "As it is written: “There is no one righteous, not even one.",
    "Romans 3:11": "There is no one who understands, no one who seeks God.",
    "Romans 3:12": "All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one.”",
    "Romans 3:13": "“Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit.” “The venom of vipers is on their lips.”",
    "Romans 3:14": "“Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.”",
    "Romans 3:15": "“Their feet are swift to shed blood;",
    "Romans 3:16": "ruin and misery lie in their wake,",
    "Romans 3:17": "and the way of peace they have not known.”",
    "Romans 3:18": "“There is no fear of God before their eyes.”",
    "Romans 3:19": "Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God.",
    "Romans 3:20": "Therefore no one will be justified in His sight by works of the law. For the law merely brings awareness of sin.",
    "Romans 3:21": "But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, as attested by the Law and the Prophets.",
    "Romans 3:22": "And this righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no distinction,",
    "Romans 3:23": "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,",
    "Romans 3:24": "and are justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.",
    "Romans 3:25": "God presented Him as an atoning sacrifice in His blood through faith, in order to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance He had passed over the sins committed beforehand.",
    "Romans 3:26": "He did this to demonstrate His righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and to justify the one who has faith in Jesus.",
    "Romans 3:27": "Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. On what principle? On that of works? No, but on that of faith.",
    "Romans 3:28": "For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the law.",
    "Romans 3:29": "Is God the God of Jews only? Is He not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too,",
    "Romans 3:30": "since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith.",
    "Romans 3:31": "Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Certainly not! Instead, we uphold the law.",
    "Romans 4:1": "What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has discovered?",
    "Romans 4:2": "If Abraham was indeed justified by works, he had something to boast about, but not before God.",
    "Romans 4:3": "For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”",
    "Romans 4:4": "Now the wages of the worker are not credited as a gift, but as an obligation.",
    "Romans 4:5": "However, to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness.",
    "Romans 4:6": "And David speaks likewise of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:",
    "Romans 4:7": "“Blessed are they whose lawless acts are forgiven, whose sins are covered.",
    "Romans 4:8": "Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will never count against him.”",
    "Romans 4:9": "Is this blessing only on the circumcised, or also on the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham’s faith was credited to him as righteousness.",
    "Romans 4:10": "In what context was it credited? Was it after his circumcision, or before? It was not after, but before.",
    "Romans 4:11": "And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who believe but are not circumcised, in order that righteousness might be credited to them.",
    "Romans 4:12": "And he is also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised, but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.",
    "Romans 4:13": "For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world was not given through the law, but through the righteousness that comes by faith.",
    "Romans 4:14": "For if those who live by the law are heirs, faith is useless and the promise is worthless,",
    "Romans 4:15": "because the law brings wrath. And where there is no law, there is no transgression.",
    "Romans 4:16": "Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may rest on grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham’s offspring—not only to those who are of the law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all.",
    "Romans 4:17": "As it is written: “I have made you a father of many nations.” He is our father in the presence of God, in whom he believed, the God who gives life to the dead and calls into being what does not yet exist.",
    "Romans 4:18": "Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as he had been told, “So shall your offspring be.”",
    "Romans 4:19": "Without weakening in his faith, he acknowledged the decrepitness of his body (since he was about a hundred years old) and the lifelessness of Sarah’s womb.",
    "Romans 4:20": "Yet he did not waver through disbelief in the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,",
    "Romans 4:21": "being fully persuaded that God was able to do what He had promised.",
    "Romans 4:22": "This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.”",
    "Romans 4:23": "Now the words “it was credited to him” were written not only for Abraham,",
    "Romans 4:24": "but also for us, to whom righteousness will be credited—for us who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.",
    "Romans 4:25": "He was delivered over to death for our trespasses and was raised to life for our justification.",
    "Romans 5:1": "Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,",
    "Romans 5:2": "through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we stand. And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.",
    "Romans 5:3": "Not only that, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance;",
    "Romans 5:4": "perseverance, character; and character, hope.",
    "Romans 5:5": "And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out His love into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, whom He has given us.",
    "Romans 5:6": "For at just the right time, while we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly.",
    "Romans 5:7": "Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die.",
    "Romans 5:8": "But God proves His love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.",
    "Romans 5:9": "Therefore, since we have now been justified by His blood, how much more shall we be saved from wrath through Him!",
    "Romans 5:10": "For if, when we were enemies of God, we were reconciled to Him through the death of His Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through His life!",
    "Romans 5:11": "Not only that, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.",
    "Romans 5:12": "Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, so also death was passed on to all men, because all sinned.",
    "Romans 5:13": "For sin was in the world before the law was given; but sin is not taken into account when there is no law.",
    "Romans 5:14": "Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who did not sin in the way that Adam transgressed. He is a pattern of the One to come.",
    "Romans 5:15": "But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God’s grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many!",
    "Romans 5:16": "Again, the gift is not like the result of the one man’s sin: The judgment that followed one sin brought condemnation, but the gift that followed many trespasses brought justification.",
    "Romans 5:17": "For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ!",
    "Romans 5:18": "So then, just as one trespass brought condemnation for all men, so also one act of righteousness brought justification and life for all men.",
    "Romans 5:19": "For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.",
    "Romans 5:20": "The law came in so that the trespass would increase; but where sin increased, grace increased all the more,",
    "Romans 5:21": "so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.",
    "Romans 6:1": "What then shall we say? Shall we continue in sin so that grace may increase?",
    "Romans 6:2": "Certainly not! How can we who died to sin live in it any longer?",
    "Romans 6:3": "Or aren’t you aware that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?",
    "Romans 6:4": "We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may walk in newness of life.",
    "Romans 6:5": "For if we have been united with Him like this in His death, we will certainly also be united with Him in His resurrection.",
    "Romans 6:6": "We know that our old self was crucified with Him so that the body of sin might be rendered powerless, that we should no longer be slaves to sin.",
    "Romans 6:7": "For anyone who has died has been freed from sin.",
    "Romans 6:8": "Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him.",
    "Romans 6:9": "For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, He cannot die again; death no longer has dominion over Him.",
    "Romans 6:10": "The death He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life He lives, He lives to God.",
    "Romans 6:11": "So you too must count yourselves dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.",
    "Romans 6:12": "Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its desires.",
    "Romans 6:13": "Do not present the parts of your body to sin as instruments of wickedness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life; and present the parts of your body to Him as instruments of righteousness.",
    "Romans 6:14": "For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under law, but under grace.",
    "Romans 6:15": "What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law, but under grace? Certainly not!",
    "Romans 6:16": "Do you not know that when you offer yourselves as obedient slaves, you are slaves to the one you obey, whether you are slaves to sin leading to death, or to obedience leading to righteousness?",
    "Romans 6:17": "But thanks be to God that, though you once were slaves to sin, you wholeheartedly obeyed the form of teaching to which you were committed.",
    "Romans 6:18": "You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.",
    "Romans 6:19": "I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. Just as you used to offer the parts of your body in slavery to impurity and to escalating wickedness, so now offer them in slavery to righteousness leading to holiness.",
    "Romans 6:20": "For when you were slaves to sin, you were free of obligation to righteousness.",
    "Romans 6:21": "What fruit did you reap at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? The outcome of those things is death.",
    "Romans 6:22": "But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to God, the fruit you reap leads to holiness, and the outcome is eternal life.",
    "Romans 6:23": "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.",
    "Romans 7:1": "Do you not know, brothers (for I am speaking to those who know the law), that the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives?",
    "Romans 7:2": "For instance, a married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage.",
    "Romans 7:3": "So then, if she is joined to another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from that law and is not an adulteress if she marries another man.",
    "Romans 7:4": "Therefore, my brothers, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to Him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God.",
    "Romans 7:5": "For when we lived according to the flesh, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies, bearing fruit for death.",
    "Romans 7:6": "But now, having died to what bound us, we have been released from the law, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.",
    "Romans 7:7": "What then shall we say? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed, I would not have been mindful of sin if not for the law. For I would not have been aware of coveting if the law had not said, “Do not covet.”",
    "Romans 7:8": "But sin, seizing its opportunity through the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetous desire. For apart from the law, sin is dead.",
    "Romans 7:9": "Once I was alive apart from the law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died.",
    "Romans 7:10": "So I discovered that the very commandment that was meant to bring life actually brought death.",
    "Romans 7:11": "For sin, seizing its opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through the commandment put me to death.",
    "Romans 7:12": "So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous, and good.",
    "Romans 7:13": "Did that which is good, then, become death to me? Certainly not! But in order that sin might be exposed as sin, it produced death in me through what was good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.",
    "Romans 7:14": "We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin.",
    "Romans 7:15": "I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do, I do not do. But what I hate, I do.",
    "Romans 7:16": "And if I do what I do not want to do, I admit that the law is good.",
    "Romans 7:17": "In that case, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.",
    "Romans 7:18": "I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh; for I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out.",
    "Romans 7:19": "For I do not do the good I want to do. Instead, I keep on doing the evil I do not want to do.",
    "Romans 7:20": "And if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.",
    "Romans 7:21": "So this is the principle I have discovered: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me.",
    "Romans 7:22": "For in my inner being I delight in God’s law.",
    "Romans 7:23": "But I see another law at work in my body, warring against the law of my mind and holding me captive to the law of sin that dwells within me.",
    "Romans 7:24": "What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?",
    "Romans 7:25": "Thanks be to God, through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with my mind I serve the law of God, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.",
    "Romans 8:1": "Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.",
    "Romans 8:2": "For in Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set you free from the law of sin and death.",
    "Romans 8:3": "For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful man, as an offering for sin. He thus condemned sin in the flesh,",
    "Romans 8:4": "so that the righteous standard of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.",
    "Romans 8:5": "Those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh; but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.",
    "Romans 8:6": "The mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace,",
    "Romans 8:7": "because the mind of the flesh is hostile to God: It does not submit to God’s law, nor can it do so.",
    "Romans 8:8": "Those controlled by the flesh cannot please God.",
    "Romans 8:9": "You, however, are controlled not by the flesh, but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ.",
    "Romans 8:10": "But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness.",
    "Romans 8:11": "And if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit, who lives in you.",
    "Romans 8:12": "Therefore, brothers, we have an obligation, but it is not to the flesh, to live according to it.",
    "Romans 8:13": "For if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.",
    "Romans 8:14": "For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.",
    "Romans 8:15": "For you did not receive a spirit of slavery that returns you to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption to sonship, by whom we cry, “Abba! Father!”",
    "Romans 8:16": "The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children.",
    "Romans 8:17": "And if we are children, then we are heirs: heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ—if indeed we suffer with Him, so that we may also be glorified with Him.",
    "Romans 8:18": "I consider that our present sufferings are not comparable to the glory that will be revealed in us.",
    "Romans 8:19": "The creation waits in eager expectation for the revelation of the sons of God.",
    "Romans 8:20": "For the creation was subjected to futility, not by its own will, but because of the One who subjected it, in hope",
    "Romans 8:21": "that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God.",
    "Romans 8:22": "We know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until the present time.",
    "Romans 8:23": "Not only that, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.",
    "Romans 8:24": "For in this hope we were saved; but hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he can already see?",
    "Romans 8:25": "But if we hope for what we do not yet see, we wait for it patiently.",
    "Romans 8:26": "In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know how we ought to pray, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groans too deep for words.",
    "Romans 8:27": "And He who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.",
    "Romans 8:28": "And we know that God works all things together for the good of those who love Him, who are called according to His purpose.",
    "Romans 8:29": "For those God foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brothers.",
    "Romans 8:30": "And those He predestined, He also called; those He called, He also justified; those He justified, He also glorified.",
    "Romans 8:31": "What then shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?",
    "Romans 8:32": "He who did not spare His own Son but gave Him up for us all, how will He not also, along with Him, freely give us all things?",
    "Romans 8:33": "Who will bring any charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies.",
    "Romans 8:34": "Who is there to condemn us? For Christ Jesus, who died, and more than that was raised to life, is at the right hand of God—and He is interceding for us.",
    "Romans 8:35": "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?",
    "Romans 8:36": "As it is written: “For Your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.”",
    "Romans 8:37": "No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.",
    "Romans 8:38": "For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor principalities, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,",
    "Romans 8:39": "neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.",
    "Romans 9:1": "I speak the truth in Christ; I am not lying, as confirmed by my conscience in the Holy Spirit.",
    "Romans 9:2": "I have deep sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.",
    "Romans 9:3": "For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my own flesh and blood,",
    "Romans 9:4": "the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption as sons; theirs the divine glory and the covenants; theirs the giving of the law, the temple worship, and the promises.",
    "Romans 9:5": "Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them proceeds the human descent of Christ, who is God over all, forever worthy of praise! Amen.",
    "Romans 9:6": "It is not as though God’s word has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel.",
    "Romans 9:7": "Nor because they are Abraham’s descendants are they all his children. On the contrary, “Through Isaac your offspring will be reckoned.”",
    "Romans 9:8": "So it is not the children of the flesh who are God’s children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as offspring.",
    "Romans 9:9": "For this is what the promise stated: “At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.”",
    "Romans 9:10": "Not only that, but Rebecca’s children were conceived by one man, our father Isaac.",
    "Romans 9:11": "Yet before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad, in order that God’s plan of election might stand,",
    "Romans 9:12": "not by works but by Him who calls, she was told, “The older will serve the younger.”",
    "Romans 9:13": "So it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”",
    "Romans 9:14": "What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Certainly not!",
    "Romans 9:15": "For He says to Moses: “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”",
    "Romans 9:16": "So then, it does not depend on man’s desire or effort, but on God’s mercy.",
    "Romans 9:17": "For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: “I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display My power in you, and that My name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”",
    "Romans 9:18": "Therefore God has mercy on whom He wants to have mercy, and He hardens whom He wants to harden.",
    "Romans 9:19": "One of you will say to me, “Then why does God still find fault? For who can resist His will?”",
    "Romans 9:20": "But who are you, O man, to talk back to God? Shall what is formed say to Him who formed it, “Why did You make me like this?”",
    "Romans 9:21": "Does not the potter have the right to make from the same lump of clay one vessel for special occasions and another for common use?",
    "Romans 9:22": "What if God, intending to show His wrath and make His power known, bore with great patience the vessels of His wrath, prepared for destruction?",
    "Romans 9:23": "What if He did this to make the riches of His glory known to the vessels of His mercy, whom He prepared in advance for glory—",
    "Romans 9:24": "including us, whom He has called not only from the Jews, but also from the Gentiles?",
    "Romans 9:25": "As He says in Hosea: “I will call them ‘My People’ who are not My people, and I will call her ‘My Beloved’ who is not My beloved,”",
    "Romans 9:26": "and, “It will happen that in the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not My people,’ they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’”",
    "Romans 9:27": "Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: “Though the number of the Israelites is like the sand of the sea, only the remnant will be saved.",
    "Romans 9:28": "For the Lord will carry out His sentence on the earth thoroughly and decisively.”",
    "Romans 9:29": "It is just as Isaiah foretold: “Unless the Lord of Hosts had left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have resembled Gomorrah.”",
    "Romans 9:30": "What then will we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith;",
    "Romans 9:31": "but Israel, who pursued a law of righteousness, has not attained it.",
    "Romans 9:32": "Why not? Because their pursuit was not by faith, but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone,",
    "Romans 9:33": "as it is written: “See, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense; and the one who believes in Him will never be put to shame.”",
    "Romans 10:1": "Brothers, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is for their salvation.",
    "Romans 10:2": "For I testify about them that they are zealous for God, but not on the basis of knowledge.",
    "Romans 10:3": "Because they were ignorant of God’s righteousness and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God’s righteousness.",
    "Romans 10:4": "For Christ is the end of the law, to bring righteousness to everyone who believes.",
    "Romans 10:5": "For concerning the righteousness that is by the law, Moses writes: “The man who does these things will live by them.”",
    "Romans 10:6": "But the righteousness that is by faith says: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’ (that is, to bring Christ down)",
    "Romans 10:7": "or, ‘Who will descend into the Abyss?’ (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).”",
    "Romans 10:8": "But what does it say? “The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,” that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming:",
    "Romans 10:9": "that if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.",
    "Romans 10:10": "For with your heart you believe and are justified, and with your mouth you confess and are saved.",
    "Romans 10:11": "It is just as the Scripture says: “Anyone who believes in Him will never be put to shame.”",
    "Romans 10:12": "For there is no difference between Jew and Greek: The same Lord is Lord of all, and gives richly to all who call on Him,",
    "Romans 10:13": "for, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”",
    "Romans 10:14": "How then can they call on the One in whom they have not believed? And how can they believe in the One of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone to preach?",
    "Romans 10:15": "And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!”",
    "Romans 10:16": "But not all of them welcomed the good news. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our message?”",
    "Romans 10:17": "Consequently, faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.",
    "Romans 10:18": "But I ask, did they not hear? Indeed they did: “Their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.”",
    "Romans 10:19": "I ask instead, did Israel not understand? First, Moses says: “I will make you jealous by those who are not a nation; I will make you angry by a nation without understanding.”",
    "Romans 10:20": "And Isaiah boldly says: “I was found by those who did not seek Me; I revealed Myself to those who did not ask for Me.”",
    "Romans 10:21": "But as for Israel he says: “All day long I have held out My hands to a disobedient and obstinate people.”",
    "Romans 11:1": "I ask then, did God reject His people? Certainly not! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.",
    "Romans 11:2": "God did not reject His people, whom He foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says about Elijah, how he appealed to God against Israel:",
    "Romans 11:3": "“Lord, they have killed Your prophets and torn down Your altars. I am the only one left, and they are seeking my life as well”?",
    "Romans 11:4": "And what was the divine reply to him? “I have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”",
    "Romans 11:5": "In the same way, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.",
    "Romans 11:6": "And if it is by grace, then it is no longer by works. Otherwise, grace would no longer be grace.",
    "Romans 11:7": "What then? What Israel was seeking, it failed to obtain, but the elect did. The others were hardened,",
    "Romans 11:8": "as it is written: “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that could not see, and ears that could not hear, to this very day.”",
    "Romans 11:9": "And David says: “May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution to them.",
    "Romans 11:10": "May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever.”",
    "Romans 11:11": "I ask then, did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Certainly not! However, because of their trespass, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel jealous.",
    "Romans 11:12": "But if their trespass means riches for the world, and their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring!",
    "Romans 11:13": "I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry",
    "Romans 11:14": "in the hope that I may provoke my own people to jealousy and save some of them.",
    "Romans 11:15": "For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?",
    "Romans 11:16": "If the first part of the dough is holy, so is the whole batch; if the root is holy, so are the branches.",
    "Romans 11:17": "Now if some branches have been broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others to share in the nourishment of the olive root,",
    "Romans 11:18": "do not boast over those branches. If you do, remember this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you.",
    "Romans 11:19": "You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.”",
    "Romans 11:20": "That is correct: They were broken off because of unbelief, but you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid.",
    "Romans 11:21": "For if God did not spare the natural branches, He will certainly not spare you either.",
    "Romans 11:22": "Take notice, therefore, of the kindness and severity of God: severity to those who fell, but kindness to you, if you continue in His kindness. Otherwise you also will be cut off.",
    "Romans 11:23": "And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.",
    "Romans 11:24": "For if you were cut from a wild olive tree, and contrary to nature were grafted into one that is cultivated, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!",
    "Romans 11:25": "I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you will not be conceited: A hardening in part has come to Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.",
    "Romans 11:26": "And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: “The Deliverer will come from Zion; He will remove godlessness from Jacob.",
    "Romans 11:27": "And this is My covenant with them when I take away their sins.”",
    "Romans 11:28": "Regarding the gospel, they are enemies on your account; but regarding election, they are loved on account of the patriarchs.",
    "Romans 11:29": "For God’s gifts and His call are irrevocable.",
    "Romans 11:30": "Just as you who formerly disobeyed God have now received mercy through their disobedience,",
    "Romans 11:31": "so they too have now disobeyed, in order that they too may now receive mercy through the mercy shown to you.",
    "Romans 11:32": "For God has consigned everyone to disobedience so that He may have mercy on everyone.",
    "Romans 11:33": "O, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and untraceable His ways!",
    "Romans 11:34": "“Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been His counselor?”",
    "Romans 11:35": "“Who has first given to God, that God should repay him?”",
    "Romans 11:36": "For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever! Amen.",
    "Romans 12:1": "Therefore I urge you, brothers, on account of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.",
    "Romans 12:2": "Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what is the good, pleasing, and perfect will of God.",
    "Romans 12:3": "For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but think of yourself with sober judgment, according to the measure of faith God has given you.",
    "Romans 12:4": "Just as each of us has one body with many members, and not all members have the same function,",
    "Romans 12:5": "so in Christ we who are many are one body, and each member belongs to one another.",
    "Romans 12:6": "We have different gifts according to the grace given us. If one’s gift is prophecy, let him use it in proportion to his faith;",
    "Romans 12:7": "if it is serving, let him serve; if it is teaching, let him teach;",
    "Romans 12:8": "if it is encouraging, let him encourage; if it is giving, let him give generously; if it is leading, let him lead with diligence; if it is showing mercy, let him do it cheerfully.",
    "Romans 12:9": "Love must be sincere. Detest what is evil; cling to what is good.",
    "Romans 12:10": "Be devoted to one another in brotherly love. Outdo yourselves in honoring one another.",
    "Romans 12:11": "Do not let your zeal subside; keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord.",
    "Romans 12:12": "Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, persistent in prayer.",
    "Romans 12:13": "Share with the saints who are in need. Practice hospitality.",
    "Romans 12:14": "Bless those who persecute you. Bless and do not curse.",
    "Romans 12:15": "Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep.",
    "Romans 12:16": "Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but associate with the lowly. Do not be conceited.",
    "Romans 12:17": "Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Carefully consider what is right in the eyes of everybody.",
    "Romans 12:18": "If it is possible on your part, live at peace with everyone.",
    "Romans 12:19": "Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, but leave room for God’s wrath. For it is written: “Vengeance is Mine; I will repay, says the Lord.”",
    "Romans 12:20": "On the contrary, “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink. For in so doing, you will heap burning coals on his head.”",
    "Romans 12:21": "Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.",
    "Romans 13:1": "Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which is from God. The authorities that exist have been appointed by God.",
    "Romans 13:2": "Consequently, whoever resists authority is opposing what God has set in place, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.",
    "Romans 13:3": "For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Do you want to be unafraid of the one in authority? Then do what is right, and you will have his approval.",
    "Romans 13:4": "For he is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not carry the sword in vain. He is God’s servant, an agent of retribution to the wrongdoer.",
    "Romans 13:5": "Therefore it is necessary to submit to authority, not only to avoid punishment, but also as a matter of conscience.",
    "Romans 13:6": "This is also why you pay taxes. For the authorities are God’s servants, who devote themselves to their work.",
    "Romans 13:7": "Pay everyone what you owe him: taxes to whom taxes are due, revenue to whom revenue is due, respect to whom respect is due, honor to whom honor is due.",
    "Romans 13:8": "Be indebted to no one, except to one another in love. For he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.",
    "Romans 13:9": "The commandments “Do not commit adultery,” “Do not murder,” “Do not steal,” “Do not covet,” and any other commandments, are summed up in this one decree: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”",
    "Romans 13:10": "Love does no wrong to its neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.",
    "Romans 13:11": "And do this, understanding the occasion. The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber, for our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.",
    "Romans 13:12": "The night is nearly over; the day has drawn near. So let us lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.",
    "Romans 13:13": "Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy.",
    "Romans 13:14": "Instead, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the desires of the flesh.",
    "Romans 14:1": "Accept him whose faith is weak, without passing judgment on his opinions.",
    "Romans 14:2": "For one person has faith to eat all things, while another, who is weak, eats only vegetables.",
    "Romans 14:3": "The one who eats everything must not belittle the one who does not, and the one who does not eat everything must not judge the one who does, for God has accepted him.",
    "Romans 14:4": "Who are you to judge someone else’s servant? To his own master he stands or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.",
    "Romans 14:5": "One person regards a certain day above the others, while someone else considers every day alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind.",
    "Romans 14:6": "He who observes a special day does so to the Lord; he who eats does so to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who abstains does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God.",
    "Romans 14:7": "For none of us lives to himself alone, and none of us dies to himself alone.",
    "Romans 14:8": "If we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. So whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.",
    "Romans 14:9": "For this reason Christ died and returned to life, that He might be the Lord of both the dead and the living.",
    "Romans 14:10": "Why, then, do you judge your brother? Or why do you belittle your brother? For we will all stand before God’s judgment seat.",
    "Romans 14:11": "It is written: “As surely as I live, says the Lord, every knee will bow before Me; every tongue will confess to God.”",
    "Romans 14:12": "So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God.",
    "Romans 14:13": "Therefore let us stop judging one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in your brother’s way.",
    "Romans 14:14": "I am convinced and fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for him it is unclean.",
    "Romans 14:15": "If your brother is distressed by what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy your brother, for whom Christ died.",
    "Romans 14:16": "Do not allow what you consider good, then, to be spoken of as evil.",
    "Romans 14:17": "For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.",
    "Romans 14:18": "For whoever serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by men.",
    "Romans 14:19": "So then, let us pursue what leads to peace and to mutual edification.",
    "Romans 14:20": "Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to let his eating be a stumbling block.",
    "Romans 14:21": "It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything to cause your brother to stumble.",
    "Romans 14:22": "Keep your belief about such matters between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself by what he approves.",
    "Romans 14:23": "But the one who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith; and everything that is not from faith is sin.",
    "Romans 15:1": "We who are strong ought to bear with the shortcomings of the weak and not to please ourselves.",
    "Romans 15:2": "Each of us should please his neighbor for his good, to build him up.",
    "Romans 15:3": "For even Christ did not please Himself, but as it is written: “The insults of those who insult You have fallen on Me.”",
    "Romans 15:4": "For everything that was written in the past was written for our instruction, so that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures, we might have hope.",
    "Romans 15:5": "Now may the God who gives endurance and encouragement grant you harmony with one another in Christ Jesus,",
    "Romans 15:6": "so that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "Romans 15:7": "Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring glory to God.",
    "Romans 15:8": "For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the circumcised on behalf of God’s truth, to confirm the promises made to the patriarchs,",
    "Romans 15:9": "so that the Gentiles may glorify God for His mercy. As it is written: “Therefore I will praise You among the Gentiles; I will sing hymns to Your name.”",
    "Romans 15:10": "Again, it says: “Rejoice, O Gentiles, with His people.”",
    "Romans 15:11": "And again: “Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and extol Him, all you peoples.”",
    "Romans 15:12": "And once more, Isaiah says: “The Root of Jesse will appear, One who will arise to rule over the Gentiles; in Him the Gentiles will put their hope.”",
    "Romans 15:13": "Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you believe in Him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.",
    "Romans 15:14": "I myself am convinced, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness, brimming with knowledge, and able to instruct one another.",
    "Romans 15:15": "However, I have written you a bold reminder on some points, because of the grace God has given me",
    "Romans 15:16": "to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.",
    "Romans 15:17": "Therefore I exult in Christ Jesus in my service to God.",
    "Romans 15:18": "I will not presume to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obedience by word and deed,",
    "Romans 15:19": "by the power of signs and wonders, and by the power of the Spirit of God. So from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ.",
    "Romans 15:20": "In this way I have aspired to preach the gospel where Christ was not known, so that I would not be building on someone else’s foundation.",
    "Romans 15:21": "Rather, as it is written: “Those who were not told about Him will see, and those who have not heard will understand.”",
    "Romans 15:22": "That is why I have often been hindered from coming to you.",
    "Romans 15:23": "But now that there are no further opportunities for me in these regions, and since I have longed for many years to visit you,",
    "Romans 15:24": "I hope to see you on my way to Spain. And after I have enjoyed your company for a while, you can equip me for my journey.",
    "Romans 15:25": "Now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem to serve the saints there.",
    "Romans 15:26": "For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.",
    "Romans 15:27": "They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual blessings, they are obligated to minister to them with material blessings.",
    "Romans 15:28": "So after I have completed this service and have safely delivered this bounty to them, I will set off to Spain by way of you.",
    "Romans 15:29": "I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.",
    "Romans 15:30": "Now I urge you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me.",
    "Romans 15:31": "Pray that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my service in Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints there,",
    "Romans 15:32": "so that by God’s will I may come to you with joy and together with you be refreshed.",
    "Romans 15:33": "The God of peace be with all of you. Amen.",
    "Romans 16:1": "I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a servant of the church in Cenchrea.",
    "Romans 16:2": "Welcome her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints, and assist her with anything she may need from you. For she has been a great help to many people, including me.",
    "Romans 16:3": "Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,",
    "Romans 16:4": "who have risked their lives for me. Not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them.",
    "Romans 16:5": "Greet also the church that meets at their house. Greet my beloved Epenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in the province of Asia.",
    "Romans 16:6": "Greet Mary, who has worked very hard for you.",
    "Romans 16:7": "Greet Andronicus and Junia, my fellow countrymen and fellow prisoners. They are outstanding among the apostles, and they were in Christ before I was.",
    "Romans 16:8": "Greet Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord.",
    "Romans 16:9": "Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and my beloved Stachys.",
    "Romans 16:10": "Greet Apelles, who is approved in Christ. Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus.",
    "Romans 16:11": "Greet Herodion, my fellow countryman. Greet those from the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord.",
    "Romans 16:12": "Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, women who have worked hard in the Lord. Greet my beloved Persis, who has worked very hard in the Lord.",

    "Romans 16:16": "Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ send you greetings.",
    "Romans 16:17": "Now I urge you, brothers, to watch out for those who create divisions and obstacles that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Turn away from them.",
    "Romans 16:18": "For such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the naive.",
    "Romans 16:19": "Everyone has heard about your obedience, so I rejoice over you. But I want you to be wise about what is good and innocent about what is evil.",
    "Romans 16:20": "The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.",

    "1 Corinthians 1:4": "I always thank my God for you because of the grace He has given you in Christ Jesus.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:5": "For in Him you have been enriched in every way, in all speech and all knowledge,",
    "1 Corinthians 1:6": "because our testimony about Christ was confirmed in you.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:7": "Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly await the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:8": "He will sustain you to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:9": "God, who has called you into fellowship with His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, is faithful.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:10": "I appeal to you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree together, so that there may be no divisions among you and that you may be united in mind and conviction.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:11": "My brothers, some from Chloe’s household have informed me that there are quarrels among you.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:12": "What I mean is this: Individuals among you are saying, “I follow Paul,” “I follow Apollos,” “I follow Cephas,” or “I follow Christ.”",
    "1 Corinthians 1:13": "Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized into the name of Paul?",
    "1 Corinthians 1:14": "I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,",
    "1 Corinthians 1:15": "so no one can say that you were baptized into my name.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:16": "Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that I do not remember if I baptized anyone else.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:17": "For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not with words of wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:18": "For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:19": "For it is written: “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.”",
    "1 Corinthians 1:20": "Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?",
    "1 Corinthians 1:21": "For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know Him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:22": "Jews demand signs and Greeks search for wisdom,",
    "1 Corinthians 1:23": "but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles,",
    "1 Corinthians 1:24": "but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:25": "For the foolishness of God is wiser than man’s wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than man’s strength.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:26": "Brothers, consider the time of your calling: Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were powerful; not many were of noble birth.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:27": "But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:28": "He chose the lowly and despised things of the world, and the things that are not, to nullify the things that are,",
    "1 Corinthians 1:29": "so that no one may boast in His presence.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:30": "It is because of Him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God: our righteousness, holiness, and redemption.",
    "1 Corinthians 1:31": "Therefore, as it is written: “Let him who boasts boast in the Lord.”",
    "1 Corinthians 2:1": "When I came to you, brothers, I did not come with eloquence or wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:2": "For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:3": "I came to you in weakness and fear, and with much trembling.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:4": "My message and my preaching were not with persuasive words of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit’s power,",
    "1 Corinthians 2:5": "so that your faith would not rest on men’s wisdom, but on God’s power.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:6": "Among the mature, however, we speak a message of wisdom—but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:7": "No, we speak of the mysterious and hidden wisdom of God, which He destined for our glory before time began.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:8": "None of the rulers of this age understood it. For if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:9": "Rather, as it is written: “No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no heart has imagined, what God has prepared for those who love Him.”",
    "1 Corinthians 2:10": "But God has revealed it to us by the Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:11": "For who among men knows the thoughts of man except his own spirit within him? So too, no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:12": "We have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:13": "And this is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:14": "The natural man does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God. For they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:15": "The spiritual man judges all things, but he himself is not subject to anyone’s judgment.",
    "1 Corinthians 2:16": "“For who has known the mind of the Lord, so as to instruct Him?” But we have the mind of Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:1": "Brothers, I could not address you as spiritual, but as worldly—as infants in Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:2": "I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for solid food. In fact, you are still not ready,",
    "1 Corinthians 3:3": "for you are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and dissension among you, are you not worldly? Are you not walking in the way of man?",
    "1 Corinthians 3:4": "For when one of you says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” are you not mere men?",
    "1 Corinthians 3:5": "What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? They are servants through whom you believed, as the Lord has assigned to each his role.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:6": "I planted the seed and Apollos watered it, but God made it grow.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:7": "So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:8": "He who plants and he who waters are one in purpose, and each will be rewarded according to his own labor.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:9": "For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, God’s building.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:10": "By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as an expert builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one must be careful how he builds.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:11": "For no one can lay a foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:12": "If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw,",
    "1 Corinthians 3:13": "his workmanship will be evident, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will prove the quality of each man’s work.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:14": "If what he has built survives, he will receive a reward.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:15": "If it is burned up, he will suffer loss. He himself will be saved, but only as if through the flames.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:16": "Do you not know that you yourselves are God’s temple, and that God’s Spirit dwells in you?",
    "1 Corinthians 3:17": "If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him; for God’s temple is holy, and you are that temple.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:18": "Let no one deceive himself. If any of you thinks he is wise in this age, he should become a fool, so that he may become wise.",
    "1 Corinthians 3:19": "For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God’s sight. As it is written: “He catches the wise in their craftiness.”",
    "1 Corinthians 3:20": "And again, “The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.”",
    "1 Corinthians 3:21": "Therefore, stop boasting in men. All things are yours,",
    "1 Corinthians 3:22": "whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future. All of them belong to you,",
    "1 Corinthians 3:23": "and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:1": "So then, men ought to regard us as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:2": "Now it is required of stewards that they be found faithful.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:3": "I care very little, however, if I am judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:4": "My conscience is clear, but that does not vindicate me. It is the Lord who judges me.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:5": "Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of men’s hearts. At that time each will receive his praise from God.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:6": "Brothers, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us not to go beyond what is written. Then you will not take pride in one man over another.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:7": "For who makes you so superior? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not?",
    "1 Corinthians 4:8": "Already you have all you want. Already you have become rich. Without us, you have become kings. How I wish you really were kings, so that we might be kings with you!",
    "1 Corinthians 4:9": "For it seems to me that God has displayed us apostles at the end of the procession, like prisoners appointed for death. We have become a spectacle to the whole world, to angels as well as to men.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:10": "We are fools for Christ, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honored, but we are dishonored.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:11": "To this very hour we are hungry and thirsty, we are poorly clothed, we are brutally treated, we are homeless.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:12": "We work hard with our own hands. When we are vilified, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it;",
    "1 Corinthians 4:13": "when we are slandered, we answer gently. Up to this moment we have become the scum of the earth, the refuse of the world.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:14": "I am not writing this to shame you, but to warn you as my beloved children.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:15": "Even if you have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:16": "Therefore I urge you to imitate me.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:17": "That is why I have sent you Timothy, my beloved and faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you of my way of life in Christ Jesus, which is exactly what I teach everywhere in every church.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:18": "Some of you have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to you.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:19": "But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord is willing, and then I will find out not only what these arrogant people are saying, but what power they have.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:20": "For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.",
    "1 Corinthians 4:21": "Which do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and with a gentle spirit?",
    "1 Corinthians 5:1": "It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is intolerable even among pagans: A man has his father’s wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:2": "And you are proud! Shouldn’t you rather have been stricken with grief and have removed from your fellowship the man who did this?",
    "1 Corinthians 5:3": "Although I am absent from you in body, I am present with you in spirit, and I have already pronounced judgment on the one who did this, just as if I were present.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:4": "When you are assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus and I am with you in spirit, along with the power of the Lord Jesus,",
    "1 Corinthians 5:5": "hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the Day of the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:6": "Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven works through the whole batch of dough?",
    "1 Corinthians 5:7": "Get rid of the old leaven, that you may be a new unleavened batch, as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:8": "Therefore let us keep the feast, not with the old bread, leavened with malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and of truth.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:9": "I wrote you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:10": "I was not including the sexually immoral of this world, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:11": "But now I am writing you not to associate with anyone who claims to be a brother but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or a verbal abuser, a drunkard or a swindler. With such a man do not even eat.",
    "1 Corinthians 5:12": "What business of mine is it to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside?",
    "1 Corinthians 5:13": "God will judge those outside. “Expel the wicked man from among you.”",
    "1 Corinthians 6:1": "If any of you has a grievance against another, how dare he go to law before the unrighteous instead of before the saints!",
    "1 Corinthians 6:2": "Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if you are to judge the world, are you not competent to judge trivial cases?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:3": "Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more the things of this life!",
    "1 Corinthians 6:4": "So if you need to settle everyday matters, do you appoint as judges those of no standing in the church?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:5": "I say this to your shame. Is there really no one among you wise enough to arbitrate between his brothers?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:6": "Instead, one brother goes to law against another, and this in front of unbelievers!",
    "1 Corinthians 6:7": "The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means that you are thoroughly defeated already. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?",
    "1 Corinthians 6:8": "Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong, even against your own brothers!",
    "1 Corinthians 6:9": "Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who submit to or perform homosexual acts,",
    "1 Corinthians 6:10": "nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor verbal abusers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:11": "And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:12": "“Everything is permissible for me,” but not everything is beneficial. “Everything is permissible for me,” but I will not be mastered by anything.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:13": "“Food for the stomach and the stomach for food,” but God will destroy them both. The body is not intended for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:14": "By His power God raised the Lord from the dead, and He will raise us also.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:15": "Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never!",
    "1 Corinthians 6:16": "Or don’t you know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, “The two will become one flesh.”",
    "1 Corinthians 6:17": "But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with Him in spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:18": "Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a man can commit is outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body.",
    "1 Corinthians 6:19": "Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own;",
    "1 Corinthians 6:20": "you were bought at a price. Therefore glorify God with your body.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:1": "Now for the matters you wrote about: It is good to abstain from sexual relations.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:2": "But because there is so much sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:3": "The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:4": "The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband. Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:5": "Do not deprive each other, except by mutual consent and for a time, so you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again, so that Satan will not tempt you through your lack of self-control.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:6": "I say this as a concession, not as a command.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:7": "I wish that all men were as I am. But each man has his own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:8": "Now to the unmarried and widows I say this: It is good for them to remain unmarried, as I am.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:9": "But if they cannot control themselves, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:10": "To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:11": "But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:12": "To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If a brother has an unbelieving wife and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:13": "And if a woman has an unbelieving husband and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:14": "For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his believing wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:15": "But if the unbeliever leaves, let him go. The believing brother or sister is not bound in such cases. God has called you to live in peace.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:16": "How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?",
    "1 Corinthians 7:17": "Regardless, each one should lead the life that the Lord has assigned to him and to which God has called him. This is what I prescribe in all the churches.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:18": "Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised. Was a man still uncircumcised when called? He should not be circumcised.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:19": "Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God’s commandments is what counts.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:20": "Each one should remain in the situation he was in when he was called.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:21": "Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let it concern you—but if you can gain your freedom, take the opportunity.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:22": "For he who was a slave when he was called by the Lord is the Lord’s freedman. Conversely, he who was a free man when he was called is Christ’s slave.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:23": "You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:24": "Brothers, each one should remain in the situation he was in when God called him.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:25": "Now about virgins, I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:26": "Because of the present crisis, I think it is good for a man to remain as he is.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:27": "Are you committed to a wife? Do not seek to be released. Are you free of commitment? Do not look for a wife.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:28": "But if you do marry, you have not sinned. And if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:29": "What I am saying, brothers, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they had none;",
    "1 Corinthians 7:30": "those who weep, as if they did not; those who are joyful, as if they were not; those who make a purchase, as if they had nothing;",
    "1 Corinthians 7:31": "and those who use the things of this world, as if not dependent on them. For this world in its present form is passing away.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:32": "I want you to be free from concern. The unmarried man is concerned about the work of the Lord, how he can please the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:33": "But the married man is concerned about the affairs of this world, how he can please his wife,",
    "1 Corinthians 7:34": "and his interests are divided. The unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the work of the Lord, how she can be holy in both body and spirit. But the married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world, how she can please her husband.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:35": "I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but in order to promote proper decorum and undivided devotion to the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:36": "However, if someone thinks he is acting inappropriately toward his betrothed, and if she is beyond her youth and they ought to marry, let him do as he wishes; he is not sinning; they should get married.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:37": "But the man who is firmly established in his heart and under no constraint, with control over his will and resolve in his heart not to marry the virgin, he will do well.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:38": "So then, he who marries the virgin does well, but he who does not marry her does even better.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:39": "A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, as long as he belongs to the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 7:40": "In my judgment, however, she is happier if she remains as she is. And I think that I too have the Spirit of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:1": "Now about food sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:2": "The one who thinks he knows something does not yet know as he ought to know.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:3": "But the one who loves God is known by God.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:4": "So about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that an idol is nothing at all in the world, and that there is no God but one.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:5": "For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as there are many so-called gods and lords),",
    "1 Corinthians 8:6": "yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we exist. And there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we exist.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:7": "But not everyone has this knowledge. Some people are still so accustomed to idols that they eat such food as if it were sacrificed to an idol. And since their conscience is weak, it is defiled.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:8": "But food does not bring us closer to God: We are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:9": "Be careful, however, that your freedom does not become a stumbling block to the weak.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:10": "For if someone with a weak conscience sees you who are well informed eating in an idol’s temple, will he not be encouraged to eat food sacrificed to idols?",
    "1 Corinthians 8:11": "So this weak brother, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your knowledge.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:12": "By sinning against your brothers in this way and wounding their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 8:13": "Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause him to stumble.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:1": "Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you yourselves not my workmanship in the Lord?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:2": "Even if I am not an apostle to others, surely I am to you. For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:3": "This is my defense to those who scrutinize me:",
    "1 Corinthians 9:4": "Have we no right to food and to drink?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:5": "Have we no right to take along a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:6": "Or are Barnabas and I the only apostles who must work for a living?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:7": "Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Who tends a flock and does not drink of its milk?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:8": "Do I say this from a human perspective? Doesn’t the Law say the same thing?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:9": "For it is written in the Law of Moses: “Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.” Is it about oxen that God is concerned?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:10": "Isn’t He actually speaking on our behalf? Indeed, this was written for us, because when the plowman plows and the thresher threshes, they should also expect to share in the harvest.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:11": "If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much for us to reap a material harvest from you?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:12": "If others have this right to your support, shouldn’t we have it all the more? But we did not exercise this right. Instead, we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:13": "Do you not know that those who work in the temple eat of its food, and those who serve at the altar partake of its offerings?",
    "1 Corinthians 9:14": "In the same way, the Lord has prescribed that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:15": "But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing this to suggest that something be done for me. Indeed, I would rather die than let anyone nullify my boast.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:16": "Yet when I preach the gospel, I have no reason to boast, because I am obligated to preach. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!",
    "1 Corinthians 9:17": "If my preaching is voluntary, I have a reward. But if it is not voluntary, I am still entrusted with a responsibility.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:18": "What then is my reward? That in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge, and so not use up my rights in preaching it.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:19": "Though I am free of obligation to anyone, I make myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:20": "To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), to win those under the law.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:21": "To those without the law I became like one without the law (though I am not outside the law of God but am under the law of Christ), to win those without the law.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:22": "To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:23": "I do all this for the sake of the gospel, so that I may share in its blessings.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:24": "Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way as to take the prize.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:25": "Everyone who competes in the games trains with strict discipline. They do it for a crown that is perishable, but we do it for a crown that is imperishable.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:26": "Therefore I do not run aimlessly; I do not fight like I am beating the air.",
    "1 Corinthians 9:27": "No, I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:1": "I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that our forefathers were all under the cloud, and that they all passed through the sea.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:2": "They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:3": "They all ate the same spiritual food",
    "1 Corinthians 10:4": "and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:5": "Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them, for they were struck down in the wilderness.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:6": "These things took place as examples to keep us from craving evil things as they did.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:7": "Do not be idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written: “The people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry.”",
    "1 Corinthians 10:8": "We should not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did, and in one day twenty-three thousand of them died.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:9": "We should not test Christ, as some of them did, and were killed by snakes.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:10": "And do not complain, as some of them did, and were killed by the destroying angel.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:11": "Now these things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the fulfillment of the ages has come.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:12": "So the one who thinks he is standing firm should be careful not to fall.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:13": "No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, He will also provide an escape, so that you can stand up under it.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:14": "Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:15": "I speak to reasonable people; judge for yourselves what I say.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:16": "Is not the cup of blessing that we bless a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:17": "Because there is one loaf, we who are many are one body; for we all partake of the one loaf.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:18": "Consider the people of Israel: Are not those who eat the sacrifices fellow partakers in the altar?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:19": "Am I suggesting, then, that food sacrificed to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:20": "No, but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God. And I do not want you to be participants with demons.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:21": "You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot partake in the table of the Lord and the table of demons too.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:22": "Are we trying to provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than He?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:23": "“Everything is permissible,” but not everything is beneficial. “Everything is permissible,” but not everything is edifying.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:24": "No one should seek his own good, but the good of others.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:25": "Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience,",
    "1 Corinthians 10:26": "for, “The earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness thereof.”",
    "1 Corinthians 10:27": "If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat anything set before you without raising questions of conscience.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:28": "But if someone tells you, “This food was offered to idols,” then do not eat it, for the sake of the one who told you and for the sake of conscience—",
    "1 Corinthians 10:29": "the other one’s conscience, I mean, not your own. For why should my freedom be determined by someone else’s conscience?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:30": "If I partake in the meal with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks?",
    "1 Corinthians 10:31": "So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all to the glory of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 10:32": "Do not become a stumbling block, whether to Jews or Greeks or the church of God—",
    "1 Corinthians 10:33": "as I also try to please everyone in all I do. For I am not seeking my own good, but the good of many, that they may be saved.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:1": "You are to imitate me, just as I imitate Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:2": "Now I commend you for remembering me in everything and for maintaining the traditions, just as I passed them on to you.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:3": "But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:4": "Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:5": "And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, for it is just as if her head were shaved.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:6": "If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off. And if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:7": "A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:8": "For man did not come from woman, but woman from man.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:9": "Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:10": "For this reason a woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:11": "In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:12": "For just as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:13": "Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?",
    "1 Corinthians 11:14": "Doesn’t nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him,",
    "1 Corinthians 11:15": "but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:16": "If anyone is inclined to dispute this, we have no other practice, nor do the churches of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:17": "In the following instructions I have no praise to offer, because your gatherings do more harm than good.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:18": "First of all, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:19": "And indeed, there must be differences among you to show which of you are approved.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:20": "Now then, when you come together, it is not the Lord’s Supper you eat.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:21": "For as you eat, each of you goes ahead without sharing his meal. While one remains hungry, another gets drunk.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:22": "Don’t you have your own homes in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What can I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? No, I will not!",
    "1 Corinthians 11:23": "For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night He was betrayed, took bread,",
    "1 Corinthians 11:24": "and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, “This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.”",
    "1 Corinthians 11:25": "In the same way, after supper He took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.”",
    "1 Corinthians 11:26": "For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:27": "Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:28": "Each one must examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:29": "For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body eats and drinks judgment on himself.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:30": "That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:31": "Now if we judged ourselves properly, we would not come under judgment.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:32": "But when we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:33": "So, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.",
    "1 Corinthians 11:34": "If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you come together it will not result in judgment. And when I come, I will give instructions about the remaining matters.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:1": "Now about spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:2": "You know that when you were pagans, you were influenced and led astray to mute idols.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:3": "Therefore I inform you that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus be cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:4": "There are different gifts, but the same Spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:5": "There are different ministries, but the same Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:6": "There are different ways of working, but the same God works all things in all people.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:7": "Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:8": "To one there is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom, to another the message of knowledge by the same Spirit,",
    "1 Corinthians 12:9": "to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit,",
    "1 Corinthians 12:10": "to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in various tongues, and to still another the interpretation of tongues.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:11": "All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, who apportions them to each one as He determines.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:12": "The body is a unit, though it is composed of many parts. And although its parts are many, they all form one body. So it is with Christ.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:13": "For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free, and we were all given one Spirit to drink.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:14": "For the body does not consist of one part, but of many.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:15": "If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:16": "And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:17": "If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be?",
    "1 Corinthians 12:18": "But in fact, God has arranged the members of the body, every one of them, according to His design.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:19": "If they were all one part, where would the body be?",
    "1 Corinthians 12:20": "As it is, there are many parts, but one body.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:21": "The eye cannot say to the hand, “I do not need you.” Nor can the head say to the feet, “I do not need you.”",
    "1 Corinthians 12:22": "On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,",
    "1 Corinthians 12:23": "and the parts we consider less honorable, we treat with greater honor. And our unpresentable parts are treated with special modesty,",
    "1 Corinthians 12:24": "whereas our presentable parts have no such need. But God has composed the body and has given greater honor to the parts that lacked it,",
    "1 Corinthians 12:25": "so that there should be no division in the body, but that its members should have mutual concern for one another.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:26": "If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:27": "Now you are the body of Christ, and each of you is a member of it.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:28": "And in the church God has appointed first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, and those with gifts of healing, helping, administration, and various tongues.",
    "1 Corinthians 12:29": "Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?",
    "1 Corinthians 12:30": "Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret?",
    "1 Corinthians 12:31": "But eagerly desire the greater gifts. And now I will show you the most excellent way.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:1": "If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a ringing gong or a clanging cymbal.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:2": "If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have absolute faith so as to move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:3": "If I give all I possess to the poor and exult in the surrender of my body, but have not love, I gain nothing.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:4": "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:5": "It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no account of wrongs.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:6": "Love takes no pleasure in evil, but rejoices in the truth.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:7": "It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:8": "Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be restrained; where there is knowledge, it will be dismissed.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:9": "For we know in part and we prophesy in part,",
    "1 Corinthians 13:10": "but when the perfect comes, the partial passes away.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:11": "When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I set aside childish ways.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:12": "Now we see but a dim reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.",
    "1 Corinthians 13:13": "And now these three remain: faith, hope, and love; but the greatest of these is love.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:1": "Earnestly pursue love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:2": "For he who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men, but to God. Indeed, no one understands him; he utters mysteries in the Spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:3": "But he who prophesies speaks to men for their edification, encouragement, and comfort.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:4": "The one who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but the one who prophesies edifies the church.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:5": "I wish that all of you could speak in tongues, but I would rather have you prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets so that the church may be edified.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:6": "Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:7": "Even in the case of lifeless instruments, such as the flute or harp, how will anyone recognize the tune they are playing unless the notes are distinct?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:8": "Again, if the trumpet sounds a muffled call, who will prepare for battle?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:9": "So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:10": "Assuredly, there are many different languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:11": "If, then, I do not know the meaning of someone’s language, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and he is a foreigner to me.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:12": "It is the same with you. Since you are eager to have spiritual gifts, strive to excel in gifts that build up the church.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:13": "Therefore, the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:14": "For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:15": "What then shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:16": "Otherwise, if you speak a blessing in spirit, how can someone who is uninstructed say “Amen” to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:17": "You may be giving thanks well enough, but the other one is not edified.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:18": "I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:19": "But in the church, I would rather speak five coherent words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:20": "Brothers, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be mature.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:21": "It is written in the Law: “By strange tongues and foreign lips I will speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to Me, says the Lord.”",
    "1 Corinthians 14:22": "Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers, but for unbelievers. Prophecy, however, is for believers, not for unbelievers.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:23": "So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and some who are uninstructed or some unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your minds?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:24": "But if an unbeliever or uninstructed person comes in while everyone is prophesying, he will be convicted and called to account by all,",
    "1 Corinthians 14:25": "and the secrets of his heart will be made known. So he will fall facedown and worship God, proclaiming, “God is truly among you!”",
    "1 Corinthians 14:26": "What then shall we say, brothers? When you come together, everyone has a psalm or a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. All of these must be done to build up the church.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:27": "If anyone speaks in a tongue, two, or at most three, should speak in turn, and someone must interpret.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:28": "But if there is no interpreter, he should remain silent in the church and speak only to himself and God.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:29": "Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:30": "And if a revelation comes to someone who is seated, the first speaker should stop.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:31": "For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:32": "The spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:33": "For God is not a God of disorder, but of peace—as in all the churches of the saints.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:34": "Women are to be silent in the churches. They are not permitted to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:35": "If they wish to inquire about something, they are to ask their own husbands at home; for it is dishonorable for a woman to speak in the church.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:36": "Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only ones it has reached?",
    "1 Corinthians 14:37": "If anyone considers himself a prophet or spiritual person, let him acknowledge that what I am writing you is the Lord’s command.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:38": "But if anyone ignores this, he himself will be ignored.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:39": "So, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.",
    "1 Corinthians 14:40": "But everything must be done in a proper and orderly manner.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:1": "Now, brothers, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, and in which you stand firm.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:2": "By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:3": "For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,",
    "1 Corinthians 15:4": "that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,",
    "1 Corinthians 15:5": "and that He appeared to Cephas and then to the Twelve.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:6": "After that, He appeared to more than five hundred brothers at once, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:7": "Then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:8": "And last of all He appeared to me also, as to one of untimely birth.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:9": "For I am the least of the apostles and am unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:10": "But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace to me was not in vain. No, I worked harder than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:11": "Whether, then, it was I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:12": "But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?",
    "1 Corinthians 15:13": "If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:14": "And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is worthless, and so is your faith.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:15": "In that case, we are also exposed as false witnesses about God. For we have testified about God that He raised Christ from the dead, but He did not raise Him if in fact the dead are not raised.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:16": "For if the dead are not raised, then not even Christ has been raised.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:17": "And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:18": "Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:19": "If our hope in Christ is for this life alone, we are to be pitied more than all men.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:20": "But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:21": "For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:22": "For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:23": "But each in his own turn: Christ the firstfruits; then at His coming, those who belong to Him.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:24": "Then the end will come, when He hands over the kingdom to God the Father after He has destroyed all dominion, authority, and power.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:25": "For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:26": "The last enemy to be destroyed is death.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:27": "For “God has put everything under His feet.” Now when it says that everything has been put under Him, this clearly does not include the One who put everything under Him.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:28": "And when all things have been subjected to Him, then the Son Himself will be made subject to Him who put all things under Him, so that God may be all in all.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:29": "If these things are not so, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them?",
    "1 Corinthians 15:30": "And why do we endanger ourselves every hour?",
    "1 Corinthians 15:31": "I face death every day, brothers, as surely as I boast about you in Christ Jesus our Lord.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:32": "If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus for human motives, what did I gain? If the dead are not raised, “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”",
    "1 Corinthians 15:33": "Do not be deceived: “Bad company corrupts good character.”",
    "1 Corinthians 15:34": "Sober up as you ought, and stop sinning; for some of you are ignorant of God. I say this to your shame.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:35": "But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?”",
    "1 Corinthians 15:36": "You fool! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:37": "And what you sow is not the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or something else.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:38": "But God gives it a body as He has designed, and to each kind of seed He gives its own body.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:39": "Not all flesh is the same: Men have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another, and fish another.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:40": "There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. But the splendor of the heavenly bodies is of one degree, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is of another.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:41": "The sun has one degree of splendor, the moon another, and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:42": "So will it be with the resurrection of the dead: What is sown is perishable; it is raised imperishable.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:43": "It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:44": "It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:45": "So it is written: “The first man Adam became a living being”; the last Adam a life-giving spirit.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:46": "The spiritual, however, was not first, but the natural, and then the spiritual.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:47": "The first man was of the dust of the earth, the second man from heaven.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:48": "As was the earthly man, so also are those who are of the earth; and as is the heavenly man, so also are those who are of heaven.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:49": "And just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, so also shall we bear the likeness of the heavenly man.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:50": "Now I declare to you, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:51": "Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed—",
    "1 Corinthians 15:52": "in an instant, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:53": "For the perishable must be clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:54": "When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come to pass: “Death has been swallowed up in victory.”",
    "1 Corinthians 15:55": "“Where, O Death, is your victory? Where, O Death, is your sting?”",
    "1 Corinthians 15:56": "The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.",
    "1 Corinthians 15:57": "But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!",
    "1 Corinthians 15:58": "Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast and immovable. Always excel in the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:1": "Now about the collection for the saints, you are to do as I directed the churches of Galatia:",
    "1 Corinthians 16:2": "On the first day of every week, each of you should set aside a portion of his income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will be needed.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:3": "Then, on my arrival, I will send letters with those you recommend to carry your gift to Jerusalem.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:4": "And if it is advisable for me to go also, they can travel with me.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:5": "After I go through Macedonia, however, I will come to you; for I will be going through Macedonia.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:6": "Perhaps I will stay with you awhile, or even spend the winter, so that you can help me on my journey, wherever I go.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:7": "For I do not want to see you now only in passing; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:8": "But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost,",
    "1 Corinthians 16:9": "because a great door for effective work has opened to me, even though many oppose me.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:10": "If Timothy comes, see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you, for he is doing the work of the Lord, just as I am.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:11": "No one, then, should treat him with contempt. Send him on his way in peace so that he can return to me, for I am expecting him along with the brothers.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:12": "Now about our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers. He was not at all inclined to go now, but he will go when he has the opportunity.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:13": "Be on the alert. Stand firm in the faith. Be men of courage. Be strong.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:14": "Do everything in love.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:15": "You know that Stephanas and his household were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints. Now I urge you, brothers,",
    "1 Corinthians 16:16": "to submit to such as these, and to every fellow worker and laborer.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:17": "I am glad that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus have arrived, because they have supplied what was lacking from you.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:18": "For they refreshed my spirit and yours as well. Show your appreciation, therefore, to such men.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:19": "The churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Prisca greet you warmly in the Lord, and so does the church that meets at their house.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:20": "All the brothers here send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:21": "This greeting is in my own hand—Paul.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:22": "If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be under a curse. Come, O Lord!",
    "1 Corinthians 16:23": "The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.",
    "1 Corinthians 16:24": "My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:1": "Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, To the church of God in Corinth, together with all the saints throughout Achaia:",
    "2 Corinthians 1:2": "Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:3": "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort,",
    "2 Corinthians 1:4": "who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:5": "For just as the sufferings of Christ overflow to us, so also through Christ our comfort overflows.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:6": "If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which accomplishes in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we experience.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:7": "And our hope for you is sure, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you will share in our comfort.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:8": "We do not want you to be unaware, brothers, of the hardships we encountered in the province of Asia. We were under a burden far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired even of life.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:9": "Indeed, we felt we were under the sentence of death, in order that we would not trust in ourselves, but in God, who raises the dead.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:10": "He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and He will deliver us. In Him we have placed our hope that He will yet again deliver us,",
    "2 Corinthians 1:11": "as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our behalf for the favor shown us in answer to their prayers.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:12": "For this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in relation to you, in the holiness and sincerity that are from God—not in worldly wisdom, but in the grace of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:13": "For we do not write you anything that is beyond your ability to read and understand. And I hope that you will understand us completely,",
    "2 Corinthians 1:14": "as you have already understood us in part, that you may boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of our Lord Jesus.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:15": "Confident of this, I planned to visit you first, so that you might receive a double blessing.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:16": "I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and to return to you from Macedonia, and then to have you help me on my way to Judea.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:17": "When I planned this, did I do it carelessly? Or do I make my plans by human standards, so as to say “Yes, yes” and also “No, no”?",
    "2 Corinthians 1:18": "But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not “Yes” and “No.”",
    "2 Corinthians 1:19": "For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was proclaimed among you by me and Silvanus and Timothy, was not “Yes” and “No,” but in Him it has always been “Yes.”",
    "2 Corinthians 1:20": "For all the promises of God are “Yes” in Christ. And so through Him, our “Amen” is spoken to the glory of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:21": "Now it is God who establishes both us and you in Christ. He anointed us,",
    "2 Corinthians 1:22": "placed His seal on us, and put His Spirit in our hearts as a pledge of what is to come.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:23": "I call God as my witness that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth.",
    "2 Corinthians 1:24": "Not that we lord it over your faith, but we are fellow workers with you for your joy, because it is by faith that you stand firm.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:1": "So I made up my mind not to make another painful visit to you.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:2": "For if I grieve you, who is left to cheer me but those whom I have grieved?",
    "2 Corinthians 2:3": "I wrote as I did so that on my arrival I would not be grieved by those who ought to make me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you, that you would share my joy.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:4": "For through many tears I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart, not to grieve you but to let you know how much I love you.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:5": "Now if anyone has caused grief, he has not grieved me but all of you—to some degree, not to overstate it.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:6": "The punishment imposed on him by the majority is sufficient for him.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:7": "So instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:8": "Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love for him.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:9": "My purpose in writing you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:10": "If you forgive anyone, I also forgive him. And if I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven it in the presence of Christ for your sake,",
    "2 Corinthians 2:11": "in order that Satan should not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:12": "Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and a door stood open for me in the Lord,",
    "2 Corinthians 2:13": "I had no peace in my spirit, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said goodbye to them and went on to Macedonia.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:14": "But thanks be to God, who always leads us triumphantly as captives in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of Him.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:15": "For we are to God the sweet aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing.",
    "2 Corinthians 2:16": "To the one we are an odor that brings death, to the other a fragrance that brings life. And who is qualified for such a task?",
    "2 Corinthians 2:17": "For we are not like so many others, who peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, as men sent from God.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:1": "Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some people, letters of recommendation to you or from you?",
    "2 Corinthians 3:2": "You yourselves are our letter, inscribed on our hearts, known and read by everyone.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:3": "It is clear that you are a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:4": "Such confidence before God is ours through Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:5": "Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim that anything comes from us, but our competence comes from God.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:6": "And He has qualified us as ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:7": "Now if the ministry of death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at the face of Moses because of its fleeting glory,",
    "2 Corinthians 3:8": "will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?",
    "2 Corinthians 3:9": "For if the ministry of condemnation was glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry of righteousness!",
    "2 Corinthians 3:10": "Indeed, what was once glorious has no glory now in comparison to the glory that surpasses it.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:11": "For if what was fading away came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which endures!",
    "2 Corinthians 3:12": "Therefore, since we have such a hope, we are very bold.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:13": "We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from gazing at the end of what was fading away.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:14": "But their minds were closed. For to this day the same veil remains at the reading of the old covenant. It has not been lifted, because only in Christ can it be removed.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:15": "And even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:16": "But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:17": "Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.",
    "2 Corinthians 3:18": "And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into His image with intensifying glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:1": "Therefore, since God in His mercy has given us this ministry, we do not lose heart.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:2": "Instead, we have renounced secret and shameful ways. We do not practice deceit, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by open proclamation of the truth, we commend ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:3": "And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:4": "The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:5": "For we do not proclaim ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:6": "For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” made His light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:7": "Now we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this surpassingly great power is from God and not from us.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:8": "We are hard pressed on all sides, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;",
    "2 Corinthians 4:9": "persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:10": "We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:11": "For we who are alive are always consigned to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our mortal body.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:12": "So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:13": "And in keeping with what is written, “I believed, therefore I have spoken,” we who have the same spirit of faith also believe and therefore speak,",
    "2 Corinthians 4:14": "knowing that the One who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you in His presence.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:15": "All this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is extending to more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow, to the glory of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:16": "Therefore we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, yet our inner self is being renewed day by day.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:17": "For our light and momentary affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory that is far beyond comparison.",
    "2 Corinthians 4:18": "So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:1": "For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is dismantled, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:2": "For in this tent we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling,",
    "2 Corinthians 5:3": "because when we are clothed, we will not be found naked.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:4": "For while we are in this tent, we groan under our burdens, because we do not wish to be unclothed but clothed, so that our mortality may be swallowed up by life.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:5": "And it is God who has prepared us for this very purpose and has given us the Spirit as a pledge of what is to come.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:6": "Therefore we are always confident, although we know that while we are at home in the body, we are away from the Lord.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:7": "For we walk by faith, not by sight.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:8": "We are confident, then, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:9": "So we aspire to please Him, whether we are at home in this body or away from it.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:10": "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive his due for the things done in the body, whether good or bad.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:11": "Therefore, since we know what it means to fear the Lord, we try to persuade men. What we are is clear to God, and I hope it is clear to your conscience as well.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:12": "We are not commending ourselves to you again. Instead, we are giving you an occasion to be proud of us, so that you can answer those who take pride in appearances rather than in the heart.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:13": "If we are out of our mind, it is for God; if we are of sound mind, it is for you.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:14": "For Christ’s love compels us, because we are convinced that One died for all, therefore all died.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:15": "And He died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died for them and was raised again.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:16": "So from now on we regard no one according to the flesh. Although we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:17": "Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away. Behold, the new has come!",
    "2 Corinthians 5:18": "All this is from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation:",
    "2 Corinthians 5:19": "that God was reconciling the world to Himself in Christ, not counting men’s trespasses against them. And He has committed to us the message of reconciliation.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:20": "Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making His appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ: Be reconciled to God.",
    "2 Corinthians 5:21": "God made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:1": "As God’s fellow workers, then, we urge you not to receive God’s grace in vain.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:2": "For He says: “In the time of favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.” Behold, now is the time of favor; now is the day of salvation!",
    "2 Corinthians 6:3": "We put no obstacle in anyone’s way, so that no one can discredit our ministry.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:4": "Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: in great endurance; in troubles, hardships, and calamities;",
    "2 Corinthians 6:5": "in beatings, imprisonments, and riots; in labor, sleepless nights, and hunger;",
    "2 Corinthians 6:6": "in purity, knowledge, patience, and kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love;",
    "2 Corinthians 6:7": "in truthful speech and in the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left;",
    "2 Corinthians 6:8": "through glory and dishonor, slander and praise; viewed as imposters, yet genuine;",
    "2 Corinthians 6:9": "unknown, yet well-known; dying, and yet we live on; punished, yet not killed;",
    "2 Corinthians 6:10": "sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:11": "We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians. Our hearts are open wide.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:12": "It is not our affection, but yours, that is restrained.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:13": "As a fair exchange—I speak as to my children—open wide your hearts also.",
    "2 Corinthians 6:14": "Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership can righteousness have with wickedness? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness?",
    "2 Corinthians 6:15": "What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?",
    "2 Corinthians 6:16": "What agreement can exist between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: “I will dwell with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be My people.”",
    "2 Corinthians 6:17": "“Therefore come out from among them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you.”",
    "2 Corinthians 6:18": "And: “I will be a Father to you, and you will be My sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.”",
    "2 Corinthians 7:1": "Therefore, beloved, since we have these promises, let us cleanse ourselves from everything that defiles body and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:2": "Make room for us in your hearts. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have exploited no one.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:3": "I do not say this to condemn you. I have said before that you so occupy our hearts that we live and die together with you.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:4": "Great is my confidence in you; great is my pride in you; I am filled with encouragement; in all our troubles my joy overflows.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:5": "For when we arrived in Macedonia, our bodies had no rest, but we were pressed from every direction—conflicts on the outside, fears within.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:6": "But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the arrival of Titus,",
    "2 Corinthians 7:7": "and not only by his arrival, but also by the comfort he had received from you. He told us about your longing, your mourning, and your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced all the more.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:8": "Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Although I did regret it—for I see that my letter caused you sorrow, but only for a short time—",
    "2 Corinthians 7:9": "yet now I rejoice, not because you were made sorrowful, but because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you felt the sorrow that God had intended, and so were not harmed in any way by us.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:10": "Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation without regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:11": "Consider what this godly sorrow has produced in you: what earnestness, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what zeal, what vindication! In every way you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:12": "So even though I wrote to you, it was not on account of the one who did wrong or the one who was harmed, but rather that your earnestness on our behalf would be made clear to you in the sight of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:13": "On account of this, we are encouraged. In addition to our own encouragement, we were even more delighted by the joy of Titus. For his spirit has been refreshed by all of you.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:14": "Indeed, I was not embarrassed by anything I had boasted to him about you. But just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting to Titus has proved to be true as well.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:15": "And his affection for you is even greater when he remembers that you were all obedient as you welcomed him with fear and trembling.",
    "2 Corinthians 7:16": "I rejoice that I can have complete confidence in you.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:1": "Now, brothers, we want you to know about the grace that God has given the churches of Macedonia.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:2": "In the terrible ordeal they suffered, their abundant joy and deep poverty overflowed into rich generosity.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:3": "For I testify that they gave according to their ability and even beyond it. Of their own accord,",
    "2 Corinthians 8:4": "they earnestly pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the saints.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:5": "And not only did they do as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us, through the will of God.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:6": "So we urged Titus to help complete your act of grace, just as he had started it.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:7": "But just as you excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness, and in the love we inspired in you—see that you also excel in this grace of giving.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:8": "I am not giving a command, but I am testing the sincerity of your love through the earnestness of others.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:9": "For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sake He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:10": "And this is my opinion about what is helpful for you in this matter: Last year you were the first not only to give, but even to have such a desire.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:11": "Now finish the work, so that you may complete it with the same eager desire, according to your means.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:12": "For if the eagerness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what he does not have.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:13": "It is not our intention that others may be relieved while you are burdened, but that there may be equality.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:14": "At the present time, your surplus will meet their need, so that in turn their surplus will meet your need. This way there will be equality.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:15": "As it is written: “He who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no shortfall.”",
    "2 Corinthians 8:16": "But thanks be to God, who put into the heart of Titus the same devotion I have for you.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:17": "For not only did he welcome our appeal, but he is eagerly coming to you of his own volition.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:18": "Along with Titus we are sending the brother who is praised by all the churches for his work in the gospel.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:19": "More than that, this brother was chosen by the churches to accompany us with the gracious offering we administer to honor the Lord Himself and to show our eagerness to help.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:20": "We want to avoid any criticism of the way we administer this generous gift.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:21": "For we are taking great care to do what is right, not only in the eyes of the Lord, but also in the eyes of men.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:22": "And we are sending along with them our brother who has proven his earnestness to us many times and in many ways, and now even more so by his great confidence in you.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:23": "As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker among you. As for our brothers, they are messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 8:24": "In full view of the churches, then, show these men the proof of your love and the reason for our boasting about you.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:1": "Now about the service to the saints, there is no need for me to write to you.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:2": "For I know your eagerness to help, and I have been boasting to the Macedonians that since last year you in Achaia were prepared to give. And your zeal has stirred most of them to do likewise.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:3": "But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you in this matter should not prove empty, but that you will be prepared, just as I said.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:4": "Otherwise, if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we—to say nothing of you—would be ashamed of having been so confident.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:5": "So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to visit you beforehand and make arrangements for the generous gift you had promised. This way, your gift will be prepared generously and not begrudgingly.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:6": "Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:7": "Each one should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not out of regret or compulsion. For God loves a cheerful giver.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:8": "And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in all things, at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:9": "As it is written: “He has scattered abroad His gifts to the poor; His righteousness endures forever.”",
    "2 Corinthians 9:10": "Now He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your store of seed and will increase the harvest of your righteousness.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:11": "You will be enriched in every way to be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will produce thanksgiving to God.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:12": "For this ministry of service is not only supplying the needs of the saints but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanksgiving to God.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:13": "Because of the proof this ministry provides, the saints will glorify God for your obedient confession of the gospel of Christ, and for the generosity of your contribution to them and to all the others.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:14": "And their prayers for you will express their affection for you, because of the surpassing grace God has given you.",
    "2 Corinthians 9:15": "Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!",
    "2 Corinthians 10:1": "Now by the mildness and gentleness of Christ, I appeal to you—I, Paul, who am humble when face to face with you, but bold when away.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:2": "I beg you that when I come I may not need to be as bold as I expect toward those who presume that we live according to the flesh.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:3": "For though we live in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:4": "The weapons of our warfare are not the weapons of the flesh. Instead, they have divine power to demolish strongholds.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:5": "We demolish arguments and every presumption set up against the knowledge of God; and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:6": "And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience, as soon as your obedience is complete.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:7": "You are looking at outward appearances. If anyone is confident that he belongs to Christ, he should remind himself that we belong to Christ just as much as he does.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:8": "For even if I boast somewhat excessively about the authority the Lord gave us for building you up rather than tearing you down, I will not be ashamed.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:9": "I do not want to seem to be trying to frighten you by my letters.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:10": "For some say, “His letters are weighty and forceful, but his physical presence is unimpressive, and his speaking is of no account.”",
    "2 Corinthians 10:11": "Such people should consider that what we are in our letters when absent, we will be in our actions when present.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:12": "We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they show their ignorance.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:13": "We, however, will not boast beyond our limits, but only within the field of influence that God has assigned to us—a field that reaches even to you.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:14": "We are not overstepping our bounds, as if we had not come to you. Indeed, we were the first to reach you with the gospel of Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:15": "Neither do we boast beyond our limits in the labors of others. But we hope that as your faith increases, our area of influence among you will greatly increase as well,",
    "2 Corinthians 10:16": "so that we can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you. Then we will not be boasting in the work already done in another man’s territory.",
    "2 Corinthians 10:17": "Rather, “Let him who boasts boast in the Lord.”",
    "2 Corinthians 10:18": "For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:1": "I hope you will put up with a little of my foolishness, but you are already doing that.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:2": "I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. For I promised you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:3": "I am afraid, however, that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent’s cunning, your minds may be led astray from your simple and pure devotion to Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:4": "For if someone comes and proclaims a Jesus other than the One we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit than the One you received, or a different gospel than the one you accepted, you put up with it very easily.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:5": "I consider myself in no way inferior to those “super-apostles.”",
    "2 Corinthians 11:6": "Although I am not a polished speaker, I am certainly not lacking in knowledge. We have made this clear to you in every way possible.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:7": "Was it a sin for me to humble myself in order to exalt you, because I preached the gospel of God to you free of charge?",
    "2 Corinthians 11:8": "I robbed other churches by accepting their support in order to serve you.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:9": "And when I was with you and in need, I was not a burden to anyone; for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my needs. I have refrained from being a burden to you in any way, and I will continue to do so.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:10": "As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:11": "Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!",
    "2 Corinthians 11:12": "But I will keep on doing what I am doing, in order to undercut those who want an opportunity to be regarded as our equals in the things of which they boast.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:13": "For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as apostles of Christ.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:14": "And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:15": "It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their actions.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:16": "I repeat: Let no one take me for a fool. But if you do, then receive me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:17": "In this confident boasting of mine, I am not speaking as the Lord would, but as a fool.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:18": "Since many are boasting according to the flesh, I too will boast.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:19": "For you gladly put up with fools, since you are so wise.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:20": "In fact, you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage of you or exalts himself or strikes you in the face.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:21": "To my shame I concede that we were too weak for that! Speaking as a fool, however, I can match what anyone else dares to boast about.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:22": "Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:23": "Are they servants of Christ? (I am speaking as if I were out of my mind.) I am so much more: in harder labor, in more imprisonments, in worse beatings, in frequent danger of death.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:24": "Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:25": "Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked. I spent a night and a day in the open sea.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:26": "In my frequent journeys, I have been in danger from rivers and from bandits, in danger from my countrymen and from the Gentiles, in danger in the city and in the country, in danger on the sea and among false brothers,",
    "2 Corinthians 11:27": "in labor and toil and often without sleep, in hunger and thirst and often without food, in cold and exposure.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:28": "Apart from these external trials, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:29": "Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not burn with grief?",
    "2 Corinthians 11:30": "If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:31": "The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is forever worthy of praise, knows that I am not lying.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:32": "In Damascus, the governor under King Aretas secured the city of the Damascenes in order to arrest me.",
    "2 Corinthians 11:33": "But I was lowered in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his grasp.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:1": "I must go on boasting. Although there is nothing to gain, I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:2": "I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of it I do not know, but God knows.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:3": "And I know that this man—whether in the body or out of it I do not know, but God knows—",
    "2 Corinthians 12:4": "was caught up to Paradise. The things he heard were inexpressible, things that man is not permitted to tell.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:5": "I will boast about such a man, but I will not boast about myself, except in my weaknesses.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:6": "Even if I wanted to boast, I would not be a fool, because I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain, so no one will credit me with more than he sees in me or hears from me,",
    "2 Corinthians 12:7": "or because of these surpassingly great revelations. So to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:8": "Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:9": "But He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly in my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest on me.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:10": "That is why, for the sake of Christ, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:11": "I have become a fool, but you drove me to it. In fact, you should have commended me, since I am in no way inferior to those “super-apostles,” even though I am nothing.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:12": "The marks of a true apostle—signs, wonders, and miracles—were performed among you with great perseverance.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:13": "In what way were you inferior to the other churches, except that I was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!",
    "2 Corinthians 12:14": "See, I am ready to come to you a third time, and I will not be a burden, because I am not seeking your possessions, but you. For children should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:15": "And for the sake of your souls, I will most gladly spend my money and myself. If I love you more, will you love me less?",
    "2 Corinthians 12:16": "Be that as it may, I was not a burden to you; but crafty as I am, I caught you by trickery.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:17": "Did I exploit you by anyone I sent you?",
    "2 Corinthians 12:18": "I urged Titus to visit you, and I sent our brother with him. Did Titus exploit you in any way? Did we not walk in the same Spirit and follow in the same footsteps?",
    "2 Corinthians 12:19": "Have you been thinking all along that we were making a defense to you? We speak before God in Christ, and all of this, beloved, is to build you up.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:20": "For I am afraid that when I come, I may not find you as I wish, and you may not find me as you wish. I fear that there may be quarreling, jealousy, rage, rivalry, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorder.",
    "2 Corinthians 12:21": "I am afraid that when I come again, my God will humble me before you, and I will be grieved over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of their acts of impurity, sexual immorality, and debauchery.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:1": "This is the third time I am coming to you. “Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.”",
    "2 Corinthians 13:2": "I already warned you the second time I was with you. So now in my absence I warn those who sinned earlier and everyone else: If I return, I will not spare anyone,",
    "2 Corinthians 13:3": "since you are demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak in dealing with you but is powerful among you.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:4": "For He was indeed crucified in weakness, yet He lives by God’s power. For we are also weak in Him, yet by God’s power we will live with Him concerning you.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:5": "Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Jesus Christ is in you—unless you fail the test?",
    "2 Corinthians 13:6": "And I hope you will realize that we have not failed the test.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:7": "Now we pray to God that you will not do anything wrong—not that we will appear to have stood the test, but that you will do what is right, even if we appear to have failed.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:8": "For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:9": "In fact, we rejoice when we are weak but you are strong, and our prayer is for your perfection.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:10": "This is why I write these things while absent, so that when I am present I will not need to be severe in my use of the authority that the Lord gave me for building you up, not for tearing you down.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:11": "Finally, brothers, rejoice! Aim for perfect harmony, encourage one another, be of one mind, live in peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:12": "Greet one another with a holy kiss.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:13": "All the saints send you greetings.",
    "2 Corinthians 13:14": "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with all of you.",
    "Galatians 1:1": "Paul, an apostle—sent not from men nor by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead—",
    "Galatians 1:2": "and all the brothers with me, To the churches of Galatia:",
    "Galatians 1:3": "Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,",
    "Galatians 1:4": "who gave Himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,",
    "Galatians 1:5": "to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.",
    "Galatians 1:6": "I am amazed how quickly you are deserting the One who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel—",
    "Galatians 1:7": "which is not even a gospel. Evidently some people are troubling you and trying to distort the gospel of Christ.",
    "Galatians 1:8": "But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be under a curse!",
    "Galatians 1:9": "As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be under a curse!",
    "Galatians 1:10": "Am I now seeking the approval of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.",
    "Galatians 1:11": "For I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached was not devised by man.",
    "Galatians 1:12": "I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.",
    "Galatians 1:13": "For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how severely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it.",
    "Galatians 1:14": "I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.",
    "Galatians 1:15": "But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by His grace, was pleased",
    "Galatians 1:16": "to reveal His Son in me so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not rush to consult with flesh and blood,",
    "Galatians 1:17": "nor did I go up to Jerusalem to the apostles who came before me, but I went into Arabia and later returned to Damascus.",
    "Galatians 1:18": "Only after three years did I go up to Jerusalem to confer with Cephas, and I stayed with him fifteen days.",
    "Galatians 1:19": "But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord’s brother.",
    "Galatians 1:20": "I assure you before God that what I am writing to you is no lie.",
    "Galatians 1:21": "Later I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.",
    "Galatians 1:22": "I was personally unknown, however, to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.",
    "Galatians 1:23": "They only heard the account: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.”",
    "Galatians 1:24": "And they glorified God because of me.",
    "Galatians 2:1": "Fourteen years later I went up again to Jerusalem, accompanied by Barnabas. I took Titus along also.",
    "Galatians 2:2": "I went in response to a revelation and set before them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles. But I spoke privately to those recognized as leaders, for fear that I was running or had already run in vain.",
    "Galatians 2:3": "Yet not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek.",
    "Galatians 2:4": "This issue arose because some false brothers had come in under false pretenses to spy on our freedom in Christ Jesus, in order to enslave us.",
    "Galatians 2:5": "We did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you.",
    "Galatians 2:6": "But as for the highly esteemed—whatever they were makes no difference to me; God does not show favoritism—those leaders added nothing to me.",
    "Galatians 2:7": "On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted to preach the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been to the circumcised.",
    "Galatians 2:8": "For the One who was at work in Peter’s apostleship to the circumcised was also at work in my apostleship to the Gentiles.",
    "Galatians 2:9": "And recognizing the grace that I had been given, James, Cephas, and John—those reputed to be pillars—gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, so that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcised.",
    "Galatians 2:10": "They only asked us to remember the poor, the very thing I was eager to do.",
    "Galatians 2:11": "When Cephas came to Antioch, however, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned.",
    "Galatians 2:12": "For before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself, for fear of those in the circumcision group.",
    "Galatians 2:13": "The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that by their hypocrisy even Barnabas was led astray.",
    "Galatians 2:14": "When I saw that they were not walking in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in front of them all, “If you, who are a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?”",
    "Galatians 2:15": "We who are Jews by birth and not Gentile “sinners”",
    "Galatians 2:16": "know that a man is not justified by works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have believed in Christ Jesus, that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.",
    "Galatians 2:17": "But if, while we seek to be justified in Christ, we ourselves are found to be sinners, does that make Christ a minister of sin? Certainly not!",
    "Galatians 2:18": "If I rebuild what I have already torn down, I prove myself to be a lawbreaker.",
    "Galatians 2:19": "For through the law I died to the law so that I might live to God.",
    "Galatians 2:20": "I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.",
    "Galatians 2:21": "I do not set aside the grace of God. For if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing.",
    "Galatians 3:1": "O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified.",
    "Galatians 3:2": "I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law, or by hearing with faith?",
    "Galatians 3:3": "Are you so foolish? After starting in the Spirit, are you now finishing in the flesh?",
    "Galatians 3:4": "Have you suffered so much for nothing, if it really was for nothing?",
    "Galatians 3:5": "Does God lavish His Spirit on you and work miracles among you because you practice the law, or because you hear and believe?",
    "Galatians 3:6": "So also, “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”",
    "Galatians 3:7": "Understand, then, that those who have faith are sons of Abraham.",
    "Galatians 3:8": "The Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and foretold the gospel to Abraham: “All nations will be blessed through you.”",
    "Galatians 3:9": "So those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.",
    "Galatians 3:10": "All who rely on works of the law are under a curse. For it is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.”",
    "Galatians 3:11": "Now it is clear that no one is justified before God by the law, because, “The righteous will live by faith.”",
    "Galatians 3:12": "The law, however, is not based on faith; on the contrary, “The man who does these things will live by them.”",
    "Galatians 3:13": "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us. For it is written: “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.”",
    "Galatians 3:14": "He redeemed us in order that the blessing promised to Abraham would come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.",
    "Galatians 3:15": "Brothers, let me put this in human terms. Even a human covenant, once it is ratified, cannot be canceled or amended.",
    "Galatians 3:16": "The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. The Scripture does not say, “and to seeds,” meaning many, but “and to your seed,” meaning One, who is Christ.",
    "Galatians 3:17": "What I mean is this: The law that came 430 years later does not revoke the covenant previously established by God, so as to nullify the promise.",
    "Galatians 3:18": "For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on a promise; but God freely granted it to Abraham through a promise.",
    "Galatians 3:19": "Why then was the law given? It was added because of transgressions, until the arrival of the seed to whom the promise referred. It was administered through angels by a mediator.",
    "Galatians 3:20": "A mediator is unnecessary, however, for only one party; but God is one.",
    "Galatians 3:21": "Is the law, then, opposed to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come from the law.",
    "Galatians 3:22": "But the Scripture pronounces all things confined by sin, so that by faith in Jesus Christ the promise might be given to those who believe.",
    "Galatians 3:23": "Before this faith came, we were held in custody under the law, locked up until faith should be revealed.",
    "Galatians 3:24": "So the law became our guardian to lead us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.",
    "Galatians 3:25": "Now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.",
    "Galatians 3:26": "You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.",
    "Galatians 3:27": "For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.",
    "Galatians 3:28": "There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.",
    "Galatians 3:29": "And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed and heirs according to the promise.",
    "Galatians 4:1": "What I am saying is that as long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a slave, although he is the owner of everything.",
    "Galatians 4:2": "He is subject to guardians and trustees until the date set by his father.",
    "Galatians 4:3": "So also, when we were children, we were enslaved under the basic principles of the world.",
    "Galatians 4:4": "But when the time had fully come, God sent His Son, born of a woman, born under the law,",
    "Galatians 4:5": "to redeem those under the law, that we might receive our adoption as sons.",
    "Galatians 4:6": "And because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying out, “Abba, Father!”",
    "Galatians 4:7": "So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and since you are a son, you are also an heir through God.",
    "Galatians 4:8": "Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods.",
    "Galatians 4:9": "But now that you know God, or rather are known by God, how is it that you are turning back to those weak and worthless principles? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again?",
    "Galatians 4:10": "You are observing special days and months and seasons and years!",
    "Galatians 4:11": "I fear for you, that my efforts for you may have been in vain.",
    "Galatians 4:12": "I beg you, brothers, become like me, for I became like you. You have done me no wrong.",
    "Galatians 4:13": "You know that it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to you.",
    "Galatians 4:14": "And although my illness was a trial to you, you did not despise or reject me. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus Himself.",
    "Galatians 4:15": "What then has become of your blessing? For I can testify that, if it were possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.",
    "Galatians 4:16": "Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?",
    "Galatians 4:17": "Those people are zealous for you, but not in a good way. Instead, they want to isolate you from us, so that you may be zealous for them.",
    "Galatians 4:18": "Nevertheless, it is good to be zealous if it serves a noble purpose—at any time, and not only when I am with you.",
    "Galatians 4:19": "My children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you,",
    "Galatians 4:20": "how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you.",
    "Galatians 4:21": "Tell me, you who want to be under the law, do you not understand what the law says?",
    "Galatians 4:22": "For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman.",
    "Galatians 4:23": "His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, but his son by the free woman was born through the promise.",
    "Galatians 4:24": "These things serve as illustrations, for the women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children into slavery: This is Hagar.",
    "Galatians 4:25": "Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present-day Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children.",
    "Galatians 4:26": "But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.",
    "Galatians 4:27": "For it is written: “Rejoice, O barren woman, who bears no children; break forth and cry aloud, you who have never travailed; because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband.”",
    "Galatians 4:28": "Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.",
    "Galatians 4:29": "At that time, however, the son born by the flesh persecuted the son born by the Spirit. It is the same now.",
    "Galatians 4:30": "But what does the Scripture say? “Expel the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman’s son.”",
    "Galatians 4:31": "Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.",
    "Galatians 5:1": "It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not be encumbered once more by a yoke of slavery.",
    "Galatians 5:2": "Take notice: I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at all.",
    "Galatians 5:3": "Again I testify to every man who gets himself circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law.",
    "Galatians 5:4": "You who are trying to be justified by the law have been severed from Christ; you have fallen away from grace.",
    "Galatians 5:5": "But by faith we eagerly await through the Spirit the hope of righteousness.",
    "Galatians 5:6": "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. What matters is faith expressing itself through love.",
    "Galatians 5:7": "You were running so well. Who has obstructed you from obeying the truth?",
    "Galatians 5:8": "Such persuasion does not come from the One who calls you.",
    "Galatians 5:9": "A little leaven works through the whole batch of dough.",
    "Galatians 5:10": "I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view. The one who is troubling you will bear the judgment, whoever he may be.",
    "Galatians 5:11": "Now, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished.",
    "Galatians 5:12": "As for those who are agitating you, I wish they would proceed to emasculate themselves!",
    "Galatians 5:13": "For you, brothers, were called to freedom; but do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh. Rather, serve one another in love.",
    "Galatians 5:14": "The entire law is fulfilled in a single decree: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”",
    "Galatians 5:15": "But if you keep on biting and devouring one another, watch out, or you will be consumed by one another.",
    "Galatians 5:16": "So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.",
    "Galatians 5:17": "For the flesh craves what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are opposed to each other, so that you do not do what you want.",
    "Galatians 5:18": "But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.",
    "Galatians 5:19": "The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity, and debauchery;",
    "Galatians 5:20": "idolatry and sorcery; hatred, discord, jealousy, and rage; rivalries, divisions, factions,",
    "Galatians 5:21": "and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.",
    "Galatians 5:22": "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,",
    "Galatians 5:23": "gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.",
    "Galatians 5:24": "Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.",
    "Galatians 5:25": "Since we live by the Spirit, let us walk in step with the Spirit.",
    "Galatians 5:26": "Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying one another.",
    "Galatians 6:1": "Brothers, if someone is caught in a trespass, you who are spiritual should restore him with a spirit of gentleness. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted.",
    "Galatians 6:2": "Carry one another’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.",
    "Galatians 6:3": "If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.",
    "Galatians 6:4": "Each one should test his own work. Then he will have reason to boast in himself alone, and not in someone else.",
    "Galatians 6:5": "For each one should carry his own load.",
    "Galatians 6:6": "Nevertheless, the one who receives instruction in the word must share in all good things with his instructor.",
    "Galatians 6:7": "Do not be deceived: God is not to be mocked. Whatever a man sows, he will reap in return.",
    "Galatians 6:8": "The one who sows to please his flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; but the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.",
    "Galatians 6:9": "Let us not grow weary in well-doing, for in due time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.",
    "Galatians 6:10": "Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to the family of faith.",
    "Galatians 6:11": "See what large letters I am using to write to you with my own hand!",
    "Galatians 6:12": "Those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying to compel you to be circumcised. They only do this to avoid persecution for the cross of Christ.",
    "Galatians 6:13": "For the circumcised do not even keep the law themselves, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.",
    "Galatians 6:14": "But as for me, may I never boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.",
    "Galatians 6:15": "For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything. What counts is a new creation.",
    "Galatians 6:16": "Peace and mercy to all who walk by this rule, even to the Israel of God.",
    "Galatians 6:17": "From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.",
    "Galatians 6:18": "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.",
    "Ephesians 1:1": "Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To the saints in Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus:",
    "Ephesians 1:2": "Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "Ephesians 1:3": "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms.",
    "Ephesians 1:4": "For He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless in His presence. In love",
    "Ephesians 1:5": "He predestined us for adoption as His sons through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of His will,",
    "Ephesians 1:6": "to the praise of His glorious grace, which He has freely given us in the Beloved One.",
    "Ephesians 1:7": "In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace",
    "Ephesians 1:8": "that He lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding.",
    "Ephesians 1:9": "And He has made known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Christ",
    "Ephesians 1:10": "as a plan for the fullness of time, to bring all things in heaven and on earth together in Christ.",
    "Ephesians 1:11": "In Him we were also chosen as God’s own, having been predestined according to the plan of Him who works out everything by the counsel of His will,",
    "Ephesians 1:12": "in order that we, who were the first to hope in Christ, would be for the praise of His glory.",
    "Ephesians 1:13": "And in Him, having heard and believed the word of truth—the gospel of your salvation—you were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,",
    "Ephesians 1:14": "who is the pledge of our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession, to the praise of His glory.",
    "Ephesians 1:15": "For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,",
    "Ephesians 1:16": "I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers,",
    "Ephesians 1:17": "that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in your knowledge of Him.",
    "Ephesians 1:18": "I ask that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you may know the hope of His calling, the riches of His glorious inheritance in the saints,",
    "Ephesians 1:19": "and the surpassing greatness of His power to us who believe. These are in accordance with the working of His mighty strength,",
    "Ephesians 1:20": "which He exerted in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly realms,",
    "Ephesians 1:21": "far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in the present age but also in the one to come.",
    "Ephesians 1:22": "And God put everything under His feet and made Him head over everything for the church,",
    "Ephesians 1:23": "which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.",
    "Ephesians 2:1": "And you were dead in your trespasses and sins,",
    "Ephesians 2:2": "in which you used to walk when you conformed to the ways of this world and of the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit who is now at work in the sons of disobedience.",
    "Ephesians 2:3": "All of us also lived among them at one time, fulfilling the cravings of our flesh and indulging its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature children of wrath.",
    "Ephesians 2:4": "But because of His great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy,",
    "Ephesians 2:5": "made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in our trespasses. It is by grace you have been saved!",
    "Ephesians 2:6": "And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with Him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus,",
    "Ephesians 2:7": "in order that in the coming ages He might display the surpassing riches of His grace, demonstrated by His kindness to us in Christ Jesus.",
    "Ephesians 2:8": "For it is by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not from yourselves; it is the gift of God,",
    "Ephesians 2:9": "not by works, so that no one can boast.",
    "Ephesians 2:10": "For we are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance as our way of life.",
    "Ephesians 2:11": "Therefore remember that formerly you who are Gentiles in the flesh and called uncircumcised by the so-called circumcision (that done in the body by human hands)—",
    "Ephesians 2:12": "remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world.",
    "Ephesians 2:13": "But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ.",
    "Ephesians 2:14": "For He Himself is our peace, who has made the two one and has torn down the dividing wall of hostility",
    "Ephesians 2:15": "by abolishing in His flesh the law of commandments and decrees. He did this to create in Himself one new man out of the two, thus making peace",
    "Ephesians 2:16": "and reconciling both of them to God in one body through the cross, by which He put to death their hostility.",
    "Ephesians 2:17": "He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near.",
    "Ephesians 2:18": "For through Him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit.",
    "Ephesians 2:19": "Therefore you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of God’s household,",
    "Ephesians 2:20": "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the cornerstone.",
    "Ephesians 2:21": "In Him the whole building is fitted together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord.",
    "Ephesians 2:22": "And in Him you too are being built together into a dwelling place for God in His Spirit.",
    "Ephesians 3:1": "For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles...",
    "Ephesians 3:2": "Surely you have heard about the stewardship of God’s grace that was given to me for you,",
    "Ephesians 3:3": "that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly.",
    "Ephesians 3:4": "In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,",
    "Ephesians 3:5": "which was not made known to men in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God’s holy apostles and prophets.",
    "Ephesians 3:6": "This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are fellow heirs, fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus.",
    "Ephesians 3:7": "I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God’s grace, given me through the working of His power.",
    "Ephesians 3:8": "Though I am less than the least of all the saints, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,",
    "Ephesians 3:9": "and to illuminate for everyone the stewardship of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things.",
    "Ephesians 3:10": "His purpose was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,",
    "Ephesians 3:11": "according to the eternal purpose that He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.",
    "Ephesians 3:12": "In Him and through faith in Him we may enter God’s presence with boldness and confidence.",
    "Ephesians 3:13": "So I ask you not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory.",
    "Ephesians 3:14": "... for this reason I bow my knees before the Father,",
    "Ephesians 3:15": "from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name.",
    "Ephesians 3:16": "I ask that out of the riches of His glory He may strengthen you with power through His Spirit in your inner being,",
    "Ephesians 3:17": "so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. Then you, being rooted and grounded in love,",
    "Ephesians 3:18": "will have power, together with all the saints, to comprehend the length and width and height and depth",
    "Ephesians 3:19": "of the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.",
    "Ephesians 3:20": "Now to Him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to His power that is at work within us,",
    "Ephesians 3:21": "to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.",
    "Ephesians 4:1": "As a prisoner in the Lord, then, I urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling you have received:",
    "Ephesians 4:2": "with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love,",
    "Ephesians 4:3": "and with diligence to preserve the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.",
    "Ephesians 4:4": "There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called;",
    "Ephesians 4:5": "one Lord, one faith, one baptism;",
    "Ephesians 4:6": "one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.",
    "Ephesians 4:7": "Now to each one of us grace has been given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.",
    "Ephesians 4:8": "This is why it says: “When He ascended on high, He led captives away, and gave gifts to men.”",
    "Ephesians 4:9": "What does “He ascended” mean, except that He also descended to the lower parts of the earth?",
    "Ephesians 4:10": "He who descended is the very One who ascended above all the heavens, in order to fill all things.",
    "Ephesians 4:11": "And it was He who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers,",
    "Ephesians 4:12": "to equip the saints for works of ministry and to build up the body of Christ,",
    "Ephesians 4:13": "until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God, as we mature to the full measure of the stature of Christ.",
    "Ephesians 4:14": "Then we will no longer be infants, tossed about by the waves and carried around by every wind of teaching and by the clever cunning of men in their deceitful scheming.",
    "Ephesians 4:15": "Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into Christ Himself, who is the head.",
    "Ephesians 4:16": "From Him the whole body, fitted and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love through the work of each individual part.",
    "Ephesians 4:17": "So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking.",
    "Ephesians 4:18": "They are darkened in their understanding and alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardness of their hearts.",
    "Ephesians 4:19": "Having lost all sense of shame, they have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity, with a craving for more.",
    "Ephesians 4:20": "But this is not the way you came to know Christ.",
    "Ephesians 4:21": "Surely you heard of Him and were taught in Him—in keeping with the truth that is in Jesus—",
    "Ephesians 4:22": "to put off your former way of life, your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires;",
    "Ephesians 4:23": "to be renewed in the spirit of your minds;",
    "Ephesians 4:24": "and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.",
    "Ephesians 4:25": "Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor, for we are all members of one another.",
    "Ephesians 4:26": "“Be angry, yet do not sin.” Do not let the sun set upon your anger,",
    "Ephesians 4:27": "and do not give the devil a foothold.",
    "Ephesians 4:28": "He who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing good with his own hands, that he may have something to share with the one in need.",
    "Ephesians 4:29": "Let no unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building up the one in need and bringing grace to those who listen.",
    "Ephesians 4:30": "And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.",
    "Ephesians 4:31": "Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, outcry and slander, along with every form of malice.",
    "Ephesians 4:32": "Be kind and tenderhearted to one another, forgiving each other just as in Christ God forgave you.",
    "Ephesians 5:1": "Be imitators of God, therefore, as beloved children,",
    "Ephesians 5:2": "and walk in love, just as Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us as a fragrant sacrificial offering to God.",
    "Ephesians 5:3": "But among you, as is proper among the saints, there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed.",
    "Ephesians 5:4": "Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk, or crude joking, which are out of character, but rather thanksgiving.",
    "Ephesians 5:5": "For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure, or greedy person (that is, an idolater) has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.",
    "Ephesians 5:6": "Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience.",
    "Ephesians 5:7": "Therefore do not be partakers with them.",
    "Ephesians 5:8": "For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,",
    "Ephesians 5:9": "for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth.",
    "Ephesians 5:10": "Test and prove what pleases the Lord.",
    "Ephesians 5:11": "Have no fellowship with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.",
    "Ephesians 5:12": "For it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret.",
    "Ephesians 5:13": "But everything exposed by the light becomes visible, for everything that is illuminated becomes a light itself.",
    "Ephesians 5:14": "So it is said: “Wake up, O sleeper, rise up from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.”",
    "Ephesians 5:15": "Pay careful attention, then, to how you walk, not as unwise but as wise,",
    "Ephesians 5:16": "redeeming the time, because the days are evil.",
    "Ephesians 5:17": "Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord’s will is.",
    "Ephesians 5:18": "Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to reckless indiscretion. Instead, be filled with the Spirit.",
    "Ephesians 5:19": "Speak to one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your hearts to the Lord,",
    "Ephesians 5:20": "always giving thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "Ephesians 5:21": "Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.",
    "Ephesians 5:22": "Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.",
    "Ephesians 5:23": "For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, His body, of which He is the Savior.",
    "Ephesians 5:24": "Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.",
    "Ephesians 5:25": "Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her",
    "Ephesians 5:26": "to sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,",
    "Ephesians 5:27": "and to present her to Himself as a glorious church, without stain or wrinkle or any such blemish, but holy and blameless.",
    "Ephesians 5:28": "In the same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.",
    "Ephesians 5:29": "Indeed, no one ever hated his own body, but he nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church.",
    "Ephesians 5:30": "For we are members of His body.",
    "Ephesians 5:31": "“For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”",
    "Ephesians 5:32": "This mystery is profound, but I am speaking about Christ and the church.",
    "Ephesians 5:33": "Nevertheless, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.",
    "Ephesians 6:1": "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.",
    "Ephesians 6:2": "“Honor your father and mother” (which is the first commandment with a promise),",
    "Ephesians 6:3": "“that it may go well with you and that you may have a long life on the earth.”",
    "Ephesians 6:4": "Fathers, do not provoke your children to wrath; instead, bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.",
    "Ephesians 6:5": "Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear and sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ.",
    "Ephesians 6:6": "And do this not only to please them while they are watching, but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart.",
    "Ephesians 6:7": "Serve with good will, as to the Lord and not to men,",
    "Ephesians 6:8": "because you know that the Lord will reward each one for whatever good he does, whether he is slave or free.",
    "Ephesians 6:9": "And masters, do the same for your slaves. Give up your use of threats, because you know that He who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with Him.",
    "Ephesians 6:10": "Finally, be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power.",
    "Ephesians 6:11": "Put on the full armor of God, so that you can make your stand against the devil’s schemes.",
    "Ephesians 6:12": "For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this world’s darkness, and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.",
    "Ephesians 6:13": "Therefore take up the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you will be able to stand your ground, and having done everything, to stand.",
    "Ephesians 6:14": "Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness arrayed,",
    "Ephesians 6:15": "and with your feet fitted with the readiness of the gospel of peace.",
    "Ephesians 6:16": "In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.",
    "Ephesians 6:17": "And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.",
    "Ephesians 6:18": "Pray in the Spirit at all times, with every kind of prayer and petition. To this end, stay alert with all perseverance in your prayers for all the saints.",
    "Ephesians 6:19": "Pray also for me, that whenever I open my mouth, words may be given me so that I will boldly make known the mystery of the gospel,",
    "Ephesians 6:20": "for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may proclaim it fearlessly, as I should.",
    "Ephesians 6:21": "Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will tell you everything, so that you also may know about me and what I am doing.",
    "Ephesians 6:22": "I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know about us, and that he may encourage your hearts.",
    "Ephesians 6:23": "Peace to the brothers and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "Ephesians 6:24": "Grace to all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love.",
    "Philippians 1:1": "Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, To all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi, together with the overseers and deacons:",
    "Philippians 1:2": "Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "Philippians 1:3": "I thank my God every time I remember you.",
    "Philippians 1:4": "In every prayer for all of you, I always pray with joy,",
    "Philippians 1:5": "because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now,",
    "Philippians 1:6": "being confident of this, that He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.",
    "Philippians 1:7": "It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart. For in my chains and in my defense and confirmation of the gospel, you are all partners in grace with me.",
    "Philippians 1:8": "God is my witness how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.",
    "Philippians 1:9": "And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight,",
    "Philippians 1:10": "so that you may be able to test and prove what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ,",
    "Philippians 1:11": "filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.",
    "Philippians 1:12": "Now I want you to know, brothers, that my circumstances have actually served to advance the gospel.",
    "Philippians 1:13": "As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ.",
    "Philippians 1:14": "And most of the brothers, confident in the Lord by my chains, now dare more greatly to speak the word without fear.",
    "Philippians 1:15": "It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill.",
    "Philippians 1:16": "The latter do so in love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel.",
    "Philippians 1:17": "The former, however, preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can add to the distress of my chains.",
    "Philippians 1:18": "What then is the issue? Just this: that in every way, whether by false motives or true, Christ is preached. And in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice,",
    "Philippians 1:19": "because I know that through your prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, my distress will turn out for my deliverance.",
    "Philippians 1:20": "I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have complete boldness so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.",
    "Philippians 1:21": "For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain.",
    "Philippians 1:22": "But if I go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. So what shall I choose? I do not know.",
    "Philippians 1:23": "I am torn between the two. I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better indeed.",
    "Philippians 1:24": "But it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body.",
    "Philippians 1:25": "Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,",
    "Philippians 1:26": "so that through my coming to you again your exultation in Christ Jesus will resound on account of me.",
    "Philippians 1:27": "Nevertheless, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in one spirit, contending together as one for the faith of the gospel,",
    "Philippians 1:28": "without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a clear sign of their destruction but of your salvation, and it is from God.",
    "Philippians 1:29": "For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for Him,",
    "Philippians 1:30": "since you are encountering the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.",
    "Philippians 2:1": "Therefore if you have any encouragement in Christ, if any comfort from His love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any affection and compassion,",
    "Philippians 2:2": "then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being united in spirit and purpose.",
    "Philippians 2:3": "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or empty pride, but in humility consider others more important than yourselves.",
    "Philippians 2:4": "Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.",
    "Philippians 2:5": "Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus:",
    "Philippians 2:6": "Who, existing in the form of God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped,",
    "Philippians 2:7": "but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in human likeness.",
    "Philippians 2:8": "And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to death—even death on a cross.",
    "Philippians 2:9": "Therefore God exalted Him to the highest place and gave Him the name above all names,",
    "Philippians 2:10": "that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,",
    "Philippians 2:11": "and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.",
    "Philippians 2:12": "Therefore, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now even more in my absence, continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling.",
    "Philippians 2:13": "For it is God who works in you to will and to act on behalf of His good purpose.",
    "Philippians 2:14": "Do everything without complaining or arguing,",
    "Philippians 2:15": "so that you may be blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and perverse generation, in which you shine as lights in the world",
    "Philippians 2:16": "as you hold forth the word of life, in order that I may boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain.",
    "Philippians 2:17": "But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you.",
    "Philippians 2:18": "So you too should be glad and rejoice with me.",
    "Philippians 2:19": "Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered when I learn how you are doing.",
    "Philippians 2:20": "I have nobody else like him who will genuinely care for your needs.",
    "Philippians 2:21": "For all the others look after their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.",
    "Philippians 2:22": "But you know Timothy’s proven worth, that as a child with his father he has served with me to advance the gospel.",
    "Philippians 2:23": "So I hope to send him as soon as I see what happens with me.",
    "Philippians 2:24": "And I trust in the Lord that I myself will come soon.",
    "Philippians 2:25": "But I thought it necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my needs.",
    "Philippians 2:26": "For he has been longing for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill.",
    "Philippians 2:27": "He was sick indeed, nearly unto death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow.",
    "Philippians 2:28": "Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may rejoice, and I may be less anxious.",
    "Philippians 2:29": "Welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor men like him,",
    "Philippians 2:30": "because he nearly died for the work of Christ, risking his life to make up for your deficit of service to me.",
    "Philippians 3:1": "Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you.",
    "Philippians 3:2": "Watch out for those dogs, those workers of evil, those mutilators of the flesh!",
    "Philippians 3:3": "For it is we who are the circumcision, we who worship by the Spirit of God, who glory in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh—",
    "Philippians 3:4": "though I myself could have such confidence. If anyone else thinks he has grounds for confidence in the flesh, I have more:",
    "Philippians 3:5": "circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin; a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee;",
    "Philippians 3:6": "as to zeal, persecuting the church; as to righteousness in the law, faultless.",
    "Philippians 3:7": "But whatever was gain to me I count as loss for the sake of Christ.",
    "Philippians 3:8": "More than that, I count all things as loss compared to the surpassing excellence of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ",
    "Philippians 3:9": "and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God on the basis of faith.",
    "Philippians 3:10": "I want to know Christ and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to Him in His death,",
    "Philippians 3:11": "and so, somehow, to attain to the resurrection from the dead.",
    "Philippians 3:12": "Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.",
    "Philippians 3:13": "Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead,",
    "Philippians 3:14": "I press on toward the goal to win the prize of God’s heavenly calling in Christ Jesus.",
    "Philippians 3:15": "All of us who are mature should embrace this point of view. And if you think differently about some issue, God will reveal this to you as well.",
    "Philippians 3:16": "Nevertheless, we must live up to what we have already attained.",
    "Philippians 3:17": "Join one another in following my example, brothers, and carefully observe those who walk according to the pattern we set for you.",
    "Philippians 3:18": "For as I have often told you before, and now say again even with tears: Many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.",
    "Philippians 3:19": "Their end is destruction, their god is their belly, and their glory is in their shame. Their minds are set on earthly things.",
    "Philippians 3:20": "But our citizenship is in heaven, and we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ,",
    "Philippians 3:21": "who, by the power that enables Him to subject all things to Himself, will transform our lowly bodies to be like His glorious body.",
    "Philippians 4:1": "Therefore, my brothers, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, that is how you must stand firm in the Lord, my beloved.",
    "Philippians 4:2": "I urge Euodia and Syntyche to agree with each other in the Lord.",
    "Philippians 4:3": "Yes, and I ask you, my true yokefellow, to help these women who have contended at my side for the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life.",
    "Philippians 4:4": "Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!",
    "Philippians 4:5": "Let your gentleness be apparent to all. The Lord is near.",
    "Philippians 4:6": "Be anxious for nothing, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.",
    "Philippians 4:7": "And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.",
    "Philippians 4:8": "Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think on these things.",
    "Philippians 4:9": "Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me, put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.",
    "Philippians 4:10": "Now I rejoice greatly in the Lord that at last you have revived your concern for me. You were indeed concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it.",
    "Philippians 4:11": "I am not saying this out of need, for I have learned to be content regardless of my circumstances.",
    "Philippians 4:12": "I know how to live humbly, and I know how to abound. In any and every situation I have learned the secret of being filled and being hungry, of having plenty and having need.",
    "Philippians 4:13": "I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength.",
    "Philippians 4:14": "Nevertheless, you have done well to share in my affliction.",
    "Philippians 4:15": "And as you Philippians know, in the early days of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church but you partnered with me in the matter of giving and receiving.",
    "Philippians 4:16": "For even while I was in Thessalonica, you provided for my needs again and again.",
    "Philippians 4:17": "Not that I am seeking a gift, but I am looking for the fruit that may be credited to your account.",
    "Philippians 4:18": "I have all I need and more, now that I have received your gifts from Epaphroditus. They are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.",
    "Philippians 4:19": "And my God will supply all your needs according to His glorious riches in Christ Jesus.",
    "Philippians 4:20": "To our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.",
    "Philippians 4:21": "Greet all the saints in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me send you greetings.",
    "Philippians 4:22": "All the saints send you greetings, especially those from the household of Caesar.",
    "Philippians 4:23": "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.",
    "Colossians 1:1": "Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,",
    "Colossians 1:2": "To the saints and faithful brothers in Christ at Colossae: Grace and peace to you from God our Father.",
    "Colossians 1:3": "We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,",
    "Colossians 1:4": "because we have heard about your faith in Christ Jesus and your love for all the saints—",
    "Colossians 1:5": "the faith and love proceeding from the hope stored up for you in heaven, of which you have already heard in the word of truth, the gospel",
    "Colossians 1:6": "that has come to you. All over the world this gospel is bearing fruit and growing, just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and truly understood the grace of God.",
    "Colossians 1:7": "You learned it from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf,",
    "Colossians 1:8": "and who also informed us of your love in the Spirit.",
    "Colossians 1:9": "For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,",
    "Colossians 1:10": "so that you may walk in a manner worthy of the Lord and may please Him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God,",
    "Colossians 1:11": "being strengthened with all power according to His glorious might so that you may have full endurance and patience, and joyfully",
    "Colossians 1:12": "giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light.",
    "Colossians 1:13": "He has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of His beloved Son,",
    "Colossians 1:14": "in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.",
    "Colossians 1:15": "The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.",
    "Colossians 1:16": "For in Him all things were created, things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities. All things were created through Him and for Him.",
    "Colossians 1:17": "He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.",
    "Colossians 1:18": "And He is the head of the body, the church; He is the beginning and firstborn from among the dead, so that in all things He may have preeminence.",
    "Colossians 1:19": "For God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Him,",
    "Colossians 1:20": "and through Him to reconcile to Himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through the blood of His cross.",
    "Colossians 1:21": "Once you were alienated from God and were hostile in your minds, engaging in evil deeds.",
    "Colossians 1:22": "But now He has reconciled you by Christ’s physical body through death to present you holy, unblemished, and blameless in His presence—",
    "Colossians 1:23": "if indeed you continue in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope of the gospel you heard, which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.",
    "Colossians 1:24": "Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is lacking in regard to Christ’s afflictions for the sake of His body, which is the church.",
    "Colossians 1:25": "I became its servant by the commission God gave me to fully proclaim to you the word of God,",
    "Colossians 1:26": "the mystery that was hidden for ages and generations but is now revealed to His saints.",
    "Colossians 1:27": "To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.",
    "Colossians 1:28": "We proclaim Him, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ.",
    "Colossians 1:29": "To this end I also labor, striving with all His energy working powerfully within me.",
    "Colossians 2:1": "For I want you to know how much I am struggling for you and for those at Laodicea, and for all who have not met me face to face,",
    "Colossians 2:2": "that they may be encouraged in heart, knit together in love, and filled with the full riches of complete understanding, so that they may know the mystery of God, namely Christ,",
    "Colossians 2:3": "in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.",
    "Colossians 2:4": "I say this so that no one will deceive you by smooth rhetoric.",
    "Colossians 2:5": "For although I am absent from you in body, I am present with you in spirit, and I delight to see your orderly condition and firm faith in Christ.",
    "Colossians 2:6": "Therefore, just as you have received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to walk in Him,",
    "Colossians 2:7": "rooted and built up in Him, established in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness.",
    "Colossians 2:8": "See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, which are based on human tradition and the spiritual forces of the world rather than on Christ.",
    "Colossians 2:9": "For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity dwells in bodily form.",
    "Colossians 2:10": "And you have been made complete in Christ, who is the head over every ruler and authority.",
    "Colossians 2:11": "In Him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of your sinful nature, with the circumcision performed by Christ and not by human hands.",
    "Colossians 2:12": "And having been buried with Him in baptism, you were raised with Him through your faith in the power of God, who raised Him from the dead.",
    "Colossians 2:13": "When you were dead in your trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our trespasses,",
    "Colossians 2:14": "having canceled the debt ascribed to us in the decrees that stood against us. He took it away, nailing it to the cross!",
    "Colossians 2:15": "And having disarmed the powers and authorities, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.",
    "Colossians 2:16": "Therefore let no one judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a feast, a New Moon, or a Sabbath.",
    "Colossians 2:17": "These are a shadow of the things to come, but the body that casts it belongs to Christ.",
    "Colossians 2:18": "Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you with speculation about what he has seen. Such a person is puffed up without basis by his unspiritual mind.",
    "Colossians 2:19": "He has lost connection to the head, from whom the whole body, supported and knit together by its joints and ligaments, grows as God causes it to grow.",
    "Colossians 2:20": "If you have died with Christ to the spiritual forces of the world, why, as though you still belonged to the world, do you submit to its regulations:",
    "Colossians 2:21": "“Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!”?",
    "Colossians 2:22": "These will all perish with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings.",
    "Colossians 2:23": "Such restrictions indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-prescribed worship, their false humility, and their harsh treatment of the body; but they are of no value against the indulgence of the flesh.",
    "Colossians 3:1": "Therefore, since you have been raised with Christ, strive for the things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.",
    "Colossians 3:2": "Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.",
    "Colossians 3:3": "For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.",
    "Colossians 3:4": "When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory.",
    "Colossians 3:5": "Put to death, therefore, the components of your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, and greed, which is idolatry.",
    "Colossians 3:6": "Because of these, the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience.",
    "Colossians 3:7": "When you lived among them, you also used to walk in these ways.",
    "Colossians 3:8": "But now you must put aside all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips.",
    "Colossians 3:9": "Do not lie to one another, since you have taken off the old self with its practices,",
    "Colossians 3:10": "and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator.",
    "Colossians 3:11": "Here there is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, or free, but Christ is all and is in all.",
    "Colossians 3:12": "Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, clothe yourselves with hearts of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.",
    "Colossians 3:13": "Bear with one another and forgive any complaint you may have against someone else. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.",
    "Colossians 3:14": "And over all these virtues put on love, which is the bond of perfect unity.",
    "Colossians 3:15": "Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, for to this you were called as members of one body. And be thankful.",
    "Colossians 3:16": "Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God.",
    "Colossians 3:17": "And whatever you do, in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.",
    "Colossians 3:18": "Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.",
    "Colossians 3:19": "Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.",
    "Colossians 3:20": "Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is pleasing to the Lord.",
    "Colossians 3:21": "Fathers, do not provoke your children, so they will not become discouraged.",
    "Colossians 3:22": "Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything, not only to please them while they are watching, but with sincerity of heart and fear of the Lord.",
    "Colossians 3:23": "Whatever you do, work at it with your whole being, as for the Lord and not for men,",
    "Colossians 3:24": "because you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as your reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving.",
    "Colossians 3:25": "Whoever does wrong will be repaid for his wrong, and there is no favoritism.",
    "Colossians 4:1": "Masters, supply your slaves with what is right and fair, since you know that you also have a Master in heaven.",
    "Colossians 4:2": "Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful,",
    "Colossians 4:3": "as you pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains.",
    "Colossians 4:4": "Pray that I may declare it clearly, as I should.",
    "Colossians 4:5": "Act wisely toward outsiders, redeeming the time.",
    "Colossians 4:6": "Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.",
    "Colossians 4:7": "Tychicus will tell you all the news about me. He is a beloved brother, a faithful minister, and a fellow servant in the Lord.",
    "Colossians 4:8": "I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know about us, and that he may encourage your hearts.",
    "Colossians 4:9": "With him I am sending Onesimus, our faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will tell you about everything here.",
    "Colossians 4:10": "My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you greetings, as does Mark the cousin of Barnabas. You have already received instructions about him: If he comes to you, welcome him.",
    "Colossians 4:11": "Jesus, who is called Justus, also sends greetings. These are the only Jews among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me.",
    "Colossians 4:12": "Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends you greetings. He is always wrestling in prayer for you, so that you may stand mature and fully assured in the full will of God.",
    "Colossians 4:13": "For I testify about him that he goes to great pains for you and for those at Laodicea and Hierapolis.",
    "Colossians 4:14": "Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas send you greetings.",
    "Colossians 4:15": "Greet the brothers in Laodicea, as well as Nympha and the church that meets at her house.",
    "Colossians 4:16": "After this letter has been read among you, make sure that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans, and that you in turn read the letter from Laodicea.",
    "Colossians 4:17": "Tell Archippus: “See to it that you complete the ministry you have received in the Lord.”",
    "Colossians 4:18": "This greeting is in my own hand—Paul. Remember my chains. Grace be with you.",
    "1 Thessalonians 1:1": "Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace and peace to you.",
    "1 Thessalonians 1:2": "We always thank God for all of you, remembering you in our prayers",
    "1 Thessalonians 1:3": "and continually recalling before our God and Father your work of faith, your labor of love, and your enduring hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "1 Thessalonians 1:4": "Brothers who are beloved by God, we know that He has chosen you,",
    "1 Thessalonians 1:5": "because our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power, in the Holy Spirit, and with great conviction—just as you know we lived among you for your sake.",
    "1 Thessalonians 1:6": "And you became imitators of us and of the Lord when you welcomed the message with the joy of the Holy Spirit, in spite of your great suffering.",
    "1 Thessalonians 1:7": "As a result, you have become an example to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.",
    "1 Thessalonians 1:8": "For not only did the message of the Lord ring out from you to Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith in God has gone out to every place, so that we have no need to say anything more.",
    "1 Thessalonians 1:9": "For they themselves report what kind of welcome you gave us, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God",
    "1 Thessalonians 1:10": "and to await His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead—Jesus our deliverer from the coming wrath.",
    "1 Thessalonians 2:1": "You yourselves know, brothers, that our visit to you was not in vain.",
    "1 Thessalonians 2:2": "As you are aware, we had already endured suffering and shameful treatment in Philippi. But in the face of strong opposition, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God.",
    "1 Thessalonians 2:3": "For our appeal does not arise from deceit or ulterior motives or trickery.",
    "1 Thessalonians 2:4": "Instead, we speak as those approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, not in order to please men but God, who examines our hearts.",
    "1 Thessalonians 2:5": "As you know, we never used words of flattery or any pretext for greed. God is our witness!",
    "1 Thessalonians 2:6": "Nor did we seek praise from you or from anyone else, although as apostles of Christ we had authority to demand it.",
    "1 Thessalonians 2:7": "On the contrary, we were gentle among you, like a nursing mother caring for her children.",
    "1 Thessalonians 2:8": "We cared so deeply that we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God, but our own lives as well. That is how beloved you have become to us.",
    "1 Thessalonians 2:9": "Surely you recall, brothers, our labor and toil. We worked night and day so that we would not be a burden to anyone while we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.",
    "1 Thessalonians 2:10": "You are witnesses, and so is God, of how holy, righteous, and blameless our conduct was among you who believed.",
    "1 Thessalonians 2:11": "For you know that we treated each of you as a father treats his own children—",
    "1 Thessalonians 2:12": "encouraging you, comforting you, and urging you to walk in a manner worthy of God, who calls you into His own kingdom and glory.",
    "1 Thessalonians 2:13": "And we continually thank God because, when you received the word of God that you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as it truly is, the word of God, which is also now at work in you who believe.",
    "1 Thessalonians 2:14": "For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God in Judea that are in Christ Jesus. You suffered from your own countrymen the very things they suffered from the Jews,",
    "1 Thessalonians 2:15": "who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets and drove us out as well. They are displeasing to God and hostile to all men,",
    "1 Thessalonians 2:16": "hindering us from telling the Gentiles how they may be saved. As a result, they continue to heap up their sins to full capacity; the utmost wrath has come upon them.",
    "1 Thessalonians 2:17": "Brothers, although we were torn away from you for a short time (in person, not in heart), our desire to see you face to face was even more intense.",
    "1 Thessalonians 2:18": "For we wanted to come to you—indeed I, Paul, tried again and again—but Satan obstructed us.",
    "1 Thessalonians 2:19": "After all, who is our hope, our joy, our crown of boasting, if it is not you yourselves in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming?",
    "1 Thessalonians 2:20": "You are indeed our glory and our joy.",
    "1 Thessalonians 3:1": "So when we could bear it no longer, we were willing to be left on our own in Athens.",
    "1 Thessalonians 3:2": "We sent Timothy, our brother and fellow worker for God in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your faith,",
    "1 Thessalonians 3:3": "so that none of you would be shaken by these trials. For you know that we are destined for this.",
    "1 Thessalonians 3:4": "Indeed, when we were with you, we kept warning you that we would suffer persecution; and as you know, it has come to pass.",
    "1 Thessalonians 3:5": "For this reason, when I could bear it no longer, I sent to find out about your faith, for fear that the tempter had somehow tempted you and that our labor might have been in vain.",
    "1 Thessalonians 3:6": "But just now, Timothy has returned from his visit with the good news about your faith, your love, and the fond memories you have preserved, longing to see us just as we long to see you.",
    "1 Thessalonians 3:7": "For this reason, brothers, in all our distress and persecution, we have been reassured about you, because of your faith.",
    "1 Thessalonians 3:8": "For now we can go on living, as long as you are standing firm in the Lord.",
    "1 Thessalonians 3:9": "How can we adequately thank God for you in return for our great joy over you in His presence?",
    "1 Thessalonians 3:10": "Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you face to face and supply what is lacking in your faith.",
    "1 Thessalonians 3:11": "Now may our God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you.",
    "1 Thessalonians 3:12": "And may the Lord cause you to increase and overflow with love for one another and for everyone else, just as our love for you overflows,",
    "1 Thessalonians 3:13": "so that He may establish your hearts in blamelessness and holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints. Amen.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:1": "Finally, brothers, we ask and encourage you in the Lord Jesus to live in a way that is pleasing to God, just as you have received from us. This is how you already live, so you should do so all the more.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:2": "For you know the instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:3": "For it is God’s will that you should be holy: You must abstain from sexual immorality;",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:4": "each of you must know how to control his own body in holiness and honor,",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:5": "not in lustful passion like the Gentiles who do not know God;",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:6": "and no one should ever violate or exploit his brother in this regard, because the Lord will avenge all such acts, as we have already told you and solemnly warned you.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:7": "For God has not called us to impurity, but to holiness.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:8": "Anyone, then, who rejects this command does not reject man but God, the very One who gives you His Holy Spirit.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:9": "Now about brotherly love, you do not need anyone to write to you, because you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:10": "And you are indeed showing this love to all the brothers throughout Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to excel more and more",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:11": "and to aspire to live quietly, to attend to your own matters, and to work with your own hands, as we instructed you.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:12": "Then you will behave properly toward outsiders, without being dependent on anyone.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:13": "Brothers, we do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death, so that you will not grieve like the rest, who are without hope.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:14": "For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, we also believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in Him.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:15": "By the word of the Lord, we declare to you that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who have fallen asleep.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:16": "For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a loud command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will be the first to rise.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:17": "After that, we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will always be with the Lord.",
    "1 Thessalonians 4:18": "Therefore encourage one another with these words.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:1": "Now about the times and seasons, brothers, we do not need to write to you.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:2": "For you are fully aware that the Day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:3": "While people are saying, “Peace and security,” destruction will come upon them suddenly, like labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:4": "But you, brothers, are not in the darkness so that this day should overtake you like a thief.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:5": "For you are all sons of the light and sons of the day; we do not belong to the night or to the darkness.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:6": "So then, let us not sleep as the others do, but let us remain awake and sober.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:7": "For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:8": "But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and the helmet of our hope of salvation.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:9": "For God has not appointed us to suffer wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:10": "He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with Him.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:11": "Therefore encourage and build one another up, just as you are already doing.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:12": "But we ask you, brothers, to acknowledge those who work diligently among you, who care for you in the Lord and who admonish you.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:13": "In love, hold them in highest regard because of their work. Live in peace with one another.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:14": "And we urge you, brothers, to admonish the unruly, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, and be patient with everyone.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:15": "Make sure that no one repays evil for evil. Always pursue what is good for one another and for all people.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:16": "Rejoice at all times.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:17": "Pray without ceasing.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:18": "Give thanks in every circumstance, for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:19": "Do not extinguish the Spirit.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:20": "Do not treat prophecies with contempt,",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:21": "but test all things. Hold fast to what is good.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:22": "Abstain from every form of evil.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:23": "Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely, and may your entire spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:24": "The One who calls you is faithful, and He will do it.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:25": "Brothers, pray for us as well.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:26": "Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:27": "I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers.",
    "1 Thessalonians 5:28": "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:1": "Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:2": "Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:3": "We are obligated to thank God for you all the time, brothers, as is fitting, because your faith is growing more and more, and your love for one another is increasing.",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:4": "That is why we boast among God’s churches about your perseverance and faith in the face of all the persecution and affliction you are enduring.",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:5": "All this is clear evidence of God’s righteous judgment. And so you will be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are suffering.",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:6": "After all, it is only right for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you,",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:7": "and to grant relief to you who are oppressed and to us as well. This will take place when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty angels",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:8": "in blazing fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:9": "They will suffer the penalty of eternal destruction, separated from the presence of the Lord and the glory of His might,",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:10": "on the day He comes to be glorified in His saints and regarded with wonder by all who have believed, including you who have believed our testimony.",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:11": "To this end, we always pray for you, that our God will count you worthy of His calling, and that He will powerfully fulfill your every good desire and work of faith,",
    "2 Thessalonians 1:12": "so that the name of our Lord Jesus will be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:1": "Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to Him, we ask you, brothers,",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:2": "not to be easily disconcerted or alarmed by any spirit or message or letter seeming to be from us, alleging that the Day of the Lord has already come.",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:3": "Let no one deceive you in any way, for it will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness—the son of destruction—is revealed.",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:4": "He will oppose and exalt himself above every so-called god or object of worship. So he will seat himself in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God.",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:5": "Do you not remember that I told you these things while I was still with you?",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:6": "And you know what is now restraining him, so that he may be revealed at the proper time.",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:7": "For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work, but the one who now restrains it will continue until he is taken out of the way.",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:8": "And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will slay with the breath of His mouth and annihilate by the majesty of His arrival.",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:9": "The coming of the lawless one will be accompanied by the working of Satan, with every kind of power, sign, and false wonder,",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:10": "and with every wicked deception directed against those who are perishing, because they refused the love of the truth that would have saved them.",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:11": "For this reason God will send them a powerful delusion so that they believe the lie,",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:12": "in order that judgment may come upon all who have disbelieved the truth and delighted in wickedness.",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:13": "But we should always thank God for you, brothers who are loved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning to be saved by the sanctification of the Spirit and by faith in the truth.",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:14": "To this He called you through our gospel, so that you may share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:15": "Therefore, brothers, stand firm and cling to the traditions we taught you, whether by speech or by letter.",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:16": "Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who by grace has loved us and given us eternal comfort and good hope,",
    "2 Thessalonians 2:17": "encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good word and deed.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:1": "Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may spread quickly and be held in honor, just as it was with you.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:2": "And pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men; for not everyone holds to the faith.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:3": "But the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:4": "And we have confidence in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to do what we command.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:5": "May the Lord direct your hearts into God’s love and Christ’s perseverance.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:6": "Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep away from any brother who leads an undisciplined life that is not in keeping with the tradition you received from us.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:7": "For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us, because we were not undisciplined among you,",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:8": "nor did we eat anyone’s food without paying for it. Instead, in labor and toil, we worked night and day so that we would not be a burden to any of you.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:9": "Not that we lack this right, but we wanted to offer ourselves as an example for you to imitate.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:10": "For even while we were with you, we gave you this command: “If anyone is unwilling to work, he shall not eat.”",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:11": "For we hear that some of you are leading undisciplined lives, accomplishing nothing, but being busybodies.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:12": "We command and urge such people by our Lord Jesus Christ to begin working quietly to earn their own living.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:13": "But as for you, brothers, do not grow weary in well-doing.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:14": "Take note of anyone who does not obey the instructions we have given in this letter. Do not associate with him, so that he may be ashamed.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:15": "Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:16": "Now may the Lord of peace Himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with all of you.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:17": "This greeting is in my own hand—Paul. This is my mark in every letter; it is the way I write.",
    "2 Thessalonians 3:18": "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you."
