    "Malachi 1:1": "This is the burden of the word of the LORD to Israel through Malachi:",
    "Malachi 1:2": "“I have loved you,” says the LORD. But you ask, “How have You loved us?” “Was not Esau Jacob’s brother?” declares the LORD. “Yet Jacob I have loved,",
    "Malachi 1:3": "but Esau I have hated, and I have made his mountains a wasteland and left his inheritance to the desert jackals.”",
    "Malachi 1:4": "Though Edom may say, “We have been devastated, but we will rebuild the ruins,” this is what the LORD of Hosts says: “They may build, but I will demolish. They will be called the Land of Wickedness, and a people with whom the LORD is indignant forever.",
    "Malachi 1:5": "You will see this with your own eyes, and you yourselves will say, ‘The LORD is great—even beyond the borders of Israel.’”",
    "Malachi 1:6": "“A son honors his father, and a servant his master. But if I am a father, where is My honor? And if I am a master, where is your fear of Me?” says the LORD of Hosts to you priests who despise My name. “But you ask, ‘How have we despised Your name?’",
    "Malachi 1:7": "By presenting defiled food on My altar. But you ask, ‘How have we defiled You?’ By saying that the table of the LORD is contemptible.",
    "Malachi 1:8": "When you offer blind animals for sacrifice, is it not wrong? And when you present the lame and sick ones, is it not wrong? Try offering them to your governor! Would he be pleased with you or show you favor?” asks the LORD of Hosts.",
    "Malachi 1:9": "“But ask now for God’s favor. Will He be gracious? Since this has come from your hands, will He show you favor?” asks the LORD of Hosts.",
    "Malachi 1:10": "“Oh, that one of you would shut the temple doors, so that you would no longer kindle useless fires on My altar! I take no pleasure in you,” says the LORD of Hosts, “and I will accept no offering from your hands.",
    "Malachi 1:11": "For My name will be great among the nations, from where the sun rises to where it sets. In every place, incense and pure offerings will be presented in My name, because My name will be great among the nations,” says the LORD of Hosts.",
    "Malachi 1:12": "“But you profane it when you say, ‘The table of the Lord is defiled, and as for its fruit, its food is contemptible.’",
    "Malachi 1:13": "You also say: ‘Oh, what a nuisance!’ And you turn up your nose at it,” says the LORD of Hosts. “You bring offerings that are stolen, lame, or sick! Should I accept these from your hands?” asks the LORD.",
    "Malachi 1:14": "“But cursed is the deceiver who has an acceptable male in his flock and vows to give it, but sacrifices a defective animal to the Lord. For I am a great King,” says the LORD of Hosts, “and My name is to be feared among the nations.",
    "Malachi 2:1": "“And now this decree is for you, O priests:",
    "Malachi 2:2": "If you do not listen, and if you do not take it to heart to honor My name,” says the LORD of Hosts, “I will send a curse among you, and I will curse your blessings. Yes, I have already begun to curse them, because you are not taking it to heart.",
    "Malachi 2:3": "Behold, I will rebuke your descendants, and I will spread dung on your faces, the waste from your feasts, and you will be carried off with it.",
    "Malachi 2:4": "Then you will know that I have sent you this commandment so that My covenant with Levi may continue,” says the LORD of Hosts.",
    "Malachi 2:5": "“My covenant with him was one of life and peace, which I gave to him; it called for reverence, and he revered Me and stood in awe of My name.",
    "Malachi 2:6": "True instruction was in his mouth, and nothing false was found on his lips. He walked with Me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity.",
    "Malachi 2:7": "For the lips of a priest should preserve knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, because he is the messenger of the LORD of Hosts.",
    "Malachi 2:8": "But you have departed from the way, and your instruction has caused many to stumble. You have violated the covenant of Levi,” says the LORD of Hosts.",
    "Malachi 2:9": "“So I in turn have made you despised and humiliated before all the people, because you have not kept My ways, but have shown partiality in matters of the law.”",
    "Malachi 2:10": "Do we not all have one Father? Did not one God create us? Why then do we break faith with one another so as to profane the covenant of our fathers?",
    "Malachi 2:11": "Judah has broken faith; an abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Judah has profaned the LORD’s beloved sanctuary by marrying the daughter of a foreign god.",
    "Malachi 2:12": "As for the man who does this, may the LORD cut off from the tents of Jacob everyone who is awake and aware—even if he brings an offering to the LORD of Hosts.",
    "Malachi 2:13": "And this is another thing you do: You cover the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping and groaning, because He no longer regards your offerings or receives them gladly from your hands.",
    "Malachi 2:14": "Yet you ask, “Why?” It is because the LORD has been a witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have broken faith, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant.",
    "Malachi 2:15": "Has not the LORD made them one, having a portion of the Spirit? And why one? Because He seeks godly offspring. So guard yourselves in your spirit and do not break faith with the wife of your youth.",
    "Malachi 2:16": "“For I hate divorce,” says the LORD, the God of Israel. “He who divorces his wife covers his garment with violence,” says the LORD of Hosts. So guard yourselves in your spirit and do not break faith.",
    "Malachi 2:17": "You have wearied the LORD with your words; yet you ask, “How have we wearied Him?” By saying, “All who do evil are good in the sight of the LORD, and in them He delights,” or, “Where is the God of justice?”",
    "Malachi 3:1": "“Behold, I will send My messenger, who will prepare the way before Me. Then the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to His temple—the Messenger of the covenant, in whom you delight—see, He is coming,” says the LORD of Hosts.",
    "Malachi 3:2": "But who can endure the day of His coming? And who can stand when He appears? For He will be like a refiner’s fire, like a launderer’s soap.",
    "Malachi 3:3": "And He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; He will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver. Then they will present offerings to the LORD in righteousness.",
    "Malachi 3:4": "Then the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will please the LORD, as in days of old and years gone by.",
    "Malachi 3:5": "“Then I will draw near to you for judgment. And I will be a swift witness against sorcerers and adulterers and perjurers, against oppressors of the widowed and fatherless, and against those who defraud laborers of their wages and deny justice to the foreigner but do not fear Me,” says the LORD of Hosts.",
    "Malachi 3:6": "“Because I, the LORD, do not change, you descendants of Jacob have not been destroyed.",
    "Malachi 3:7": "Yet from the days of your fathers, you have turned away from My statutes and have not kept them. Return to Me, and I will return to you,” says the LORD of Hosts. “But you ask, ‘How can we return?’",
    "Malachi 3:8": "Will a man rob God? Yet you are robbing Me! But you ask, ‘How do we rob You?’ In tithes and offerings.",
    "Malachi 3:9": "You are cursed with a curse, yet you—the whole nation—are still robbing Me.",
    "Malachi 3:10": "Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, so that there may be food in My house. Test Me in this,” says the LORD of Hosts. “See if I will not open the windows of heaven and pour out for you blessing without measure.",
    "Malachi 3:11": "I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that it will not destroy the fruits of your land, and the vine in your field will not fail to produce fruit,” says the LORD of Hosts.",
    "Malachi 3:12": "“Then all the nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delight,” says the LORD of Hosts.",
    "Malachi 3:13": "“Your words against Me have been harsh,” says the LORD. “Yet you ask, ‘What have we spoken against You?’",
    "Malachi 3:14": "You have said, ‘It is futile to serve God. What have we gained by keeping His requirements and walking mournfully before the LORD of Hosts?",
    "Malachi 3:15": "So now we call the arrogant blessed. Not only do evildoers prosper, they even test God and escape.’”",
    "Malachi 3:16": "At that time those who feared the LORD spoke with one another, and the LORD listened and heard them. So a scroll of remembrance was written before Him regarding those who feared the LORD and honored His name.",
    "Malachi 3:17": "“They will be Mine,” says the LORD of Hosts, “on the day when I prepare My treasured possession. And I will spare them as a man spares his own son who serves him.",
    "Malachi 3:18": "So you will again distinguish between the righteous and the wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not.”",
    "Malachi 4:1": "“For behold, the day is coming, burning like a furnace, when all the arrogant and every evildoer will be stubble; the day is coming when I will set them ablaze,” says the LORD of Hosts. “Not a root or branch will be left to them.”",
    "Malachi 4:2": "“But for you who fear My name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings, and you will go out and leap like calves from the stall.",
    "Malachi 4:3": "Then you will trample the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day I am preparing,” says the LORD of Hosts.",
    "Malachi 4:4": "“Remember the law of My servant Moses, the statutes and ordinances I commanded him for all Israel at Horeb.",
    "Malachi 4:5": "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and awesome Day of the LORD.",
    "Malachi 4:6": "And he will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers. Otherwise, I will come and strike the land with a curse.”",
    "Matthew 1:1": "This is the record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:",
    "Matthew 1:2": "Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers.",

    "Matthew 1:18": "This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged in marriage to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.",
    "Matthew 1:19": "Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and was unwilling to disgrace her publicly, he resolved to divorce her quietly.",
    "Matthew 1:20": "But after he had pondered these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to embrace Mary as your wife, for the One conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.",
    "Matthew 1:21": "She will give birth to a Son, and you are to give Him the name Jesus, because He will save His people from their sins.”",

    "Matthew 13:31": "He put before them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and planted in his field.",
    "Matthew 13:32": "Although it is the smallest of all seeds, yet it grows into the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.”",
    "Matthew 13:33": "He told them still another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour, until all of it was leavened.”",
    "Matthew 13:34": "Jesus spoke all these things to the crowds in parables. He did not tell them anything without using a parable.",
    "Matthew 13:35": "So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: “I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world.”",
    "Matthew 13:36": "Then Jesus dismissed the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to Him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.”",
    "Matthew 13:37": "He replied, “The One who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.",
    "Matthew 13:38": "The field is the world, and the good seed represents the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one,",
    "Matthew 13:39": "and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.",
    "Matthew 13:40": "As the weeds are collected and burned in the fire, so will it be at the end of the age.",
    "Matthew 13:41": "The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will weed out of His kingdom every cause of sin and all who practice lawlessness.",
    "Matthew 13:42": "And they will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.",
    "Matthew 13:43": "Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.",
    "Matthew 13:44": "The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and in his joy he went and sold all he had and bought that field.",
    "Matthew 13:45": "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.",
    "Matthew 13:46": "When he found one very precious pearl, he went away and sold all he had and bought it.",
    "Matthew 13:47": "Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea and caught all kinds of fish.",
    "Matthew 13:48": "When it was full, the men pulled it ashore. Then they sat down and sorted the good fish into containers, but threw the bad away.",
    "Matthew 13:49": "So will it be at the end of the age: The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous",

    "Matthew 14:18": "“Bring them here to Me,” Jesus said.",
    "Matthew 14:19": "And He directed the crowds to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, He spoke a blessing. Then He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.",
    "Matthew 14:20": "They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.",
    "Matthew 14:21": "About five thousand men were fed, besides women and children.",
    "Matthew 14:22": "Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of Him to the other side, while He dismissed the crowds.",
    "Matthew 14:23": "After He had dismissed them, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. When evening came, He was there alone,",
    "Matthew 14:24": "but the boat was already far from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.",
    "Matthew 14:25": "During the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went out to them, walking on the sea.",
    "Matthew 14:26": "When the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost!” they said, and cried out in fear.",
    "Matthew 14:27": "But Jesus spoke up at once: “Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.”",
    "Matthew 14:28": "“Lord, if it is You,” Peter replied, “command me to come to You on the water.”",

    "Matthew 15:3": "Jesus replied, “And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?",
    "Matthew 15:4": "For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother’ and ‘Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.’",

    "Matthew 26:41": "“Watch and pray so that you will not enter into temptation. For the spirit is willing, but the body is weak.”",
    "Matthew 26:42": "A second time He went away and prayed, “My Father, if this cup cannot pass unless I drink it, may Your will be done.”",
    "Matthew 26:43": "And again Jesus returned and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.",
    "Matthew 26:44": "So He left them and went away once more and prayed a third time, saying the same thing.",
    "Matthew 26:45": "Then He returned to the disciples and said, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.",
    "Matthew 26:46": "Rise, let us go! See, My betrayer is approaching!”",
    "Matthew 26:47": "While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, accompanied by a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and elders of the people.",
    "Matthew 26:48": "Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The One I kiss is the man; arrest Him.”",
    "Matthew 26:49": "Going directly to Jesus, he said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed Him.",
    "Matthew 26:50": "“Friend,” Jesus replied, “do what you came for.” Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested Him.",
    "Matthew 26:51": "At this, one of Jesus’ companions drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.",
    "Matthew 26:52": "“Put your sword back in its place,” Jesus said to him. “For all who draw the sword will die by the sword.",
    "Matthew 26:53": "Are you not aware that I can call on My Father, and He will at once put at My disposal more than twelve legions of angels?",
    "Matthew 26:54": "But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen this way?”",
    "Matthew 26:55": "At that time Jesus said to the crowd, “Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me as you would an outlaw? Every day I sat teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest Me.",
    "Matthew 26:56": "But this has all happened so that the writings of the prophets would be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples deserted Him and fled.",
    "Matthew 26:57": "Those who had arrested Jesus led Him away to the house of Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and elders had gathered.",
    "Matthew 26:58": "But Peter followed Him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. And he went in and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.",
    "Matthew 26:59": "Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking false testimony against Jesus in order to put Him to death.",
    "Matthew 26:60": "But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally two came forward",
    "Matthew 26:61": "and declared, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’”",
    "Matthew 26:62": "So the high priest stood up and asked Him, “Have You no answer? What are these men testifying against You?”",
    "Matthew 26:63": "But Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest said to Him, “I charge You under oath by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God.”",
    "Matthew 26:64": "“You have said it yourself,” Jesus answered. “But I say to all of you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.”",
    "Matthew 26:65": "At this, the high priest tore his clothes and declared, “He has blasphemed! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy.",
    "Matthew 26:66": "What do you think?” “He deserves to die,” they answered.",
    "Matthew 26:67": "Then they spit in His face and struck Him. Others slapped Him",
    "Matthew 26:68": "and said, “Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit You?”",
    "Matthew 26:69": "Meanwhile, Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came up to him. “You also were with Jesus the Galilean,” she said.",
    "Matthew 26:70": "But he denied it before them all: “I do not know what you are talking about.”",
    "Matthew 26:71": "When Peter had gone out to the gateway, another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.”",
    "Matthew 26:72": "And again he denied it with an oath: “I do not know the man!”",
    "Matthew 26:73": "After a little while, those standing nearby came up to Peter. “Surely you are one of them,” they said, “for your accent gives you away.”",
    "Matthew 26:74": "At that he began to curse and swear to them, “I do not know the man!” And immediately a rooster crowed.",
    "Matthew 26:75": "Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken: “Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly.",
    "Matthew 27:1": "When morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people conspired against Jesus to put Him to death.",
    "Matthew 27:2": "They bound Him, led Him away, and handed Him over to Pilate the governor.",
    "Matthew 27:3": "When Judas, who had betrayed Him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was filled with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.",
    "Matthew 27:4": "“I have sinned by betraying innocent blood,” he said. “What is that to us?” they replied. “You bear the responsibility.”",
    "Matthew 27:5": "So Judas threw the silver into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.",
    "Matthew 27:6": "The chief priests picked up the pieces of silver and said, “It is unlawful to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.”",
    "Matthew 27:7": "After conferring together, they used the money to buy the potter’s field as a burial place for foreigners.",
    "Matthew 27:8": "That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day.",
    "Matthew 27:9": "Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: “They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on Him by the people of Israel,",
    "Matthew 27:10": "and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord had commanded me.”",
    "Matthew 27:11": "Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, who questioned Him: “Are You the King of the Jews?” “You have said so,” Jesus replied.",
    "Matthew 27:12": "And when He was accused by the chief priests and elders, He gave no answer.",
    "Matthew 27:13": "Then Pilate asked Him, “Do You not hear how many charges they are bringing against You?”",
    "Matthew 27:14": "But Jesus gave no answer, not even to a single charge, much to the governor’s amazement.",
    "Matthew 27:15": "Now it was the governor’s custom at the feast to release to the crowd a prisoner of their choosing.",
    "Matthew 27:16": "At that time they were holding a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.",
    "Matthew 27:17": "So when the crowd had assembled, Pilate asked them, “Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?”",
    "Matthew 27:18": "For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him.",
    "Matthew 27:19": "While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him this message: “Have nothing to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered terribly in a dream today because of Him.”",
    "Matthew 27:20": "But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus put to death.",
    "Matthew 27:21": "“Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” asked the governor. “Barabbas,” they replied.",
    "Matthew 27:22": "“What then should I do with Jesus who is called Christ?” Pilate asked. They all answered, “Crucify Him!”",
    "Matthew 27:23": "“Why?” asked Pilate. “What evil has He done?” But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify Him!”",
    "Matthew 27:24": "When Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but that instead a riot was breaking out, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd. “I am innocent of this man’s blood,” he said. “You bear the responsibility.”",
    "Matthew 27:25": "All the people answered, “His blood be on us and on our children!”",
    "Matthew 27:26": "So Pilate released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed Him over to be crucified.",
    "Matthew 27:27": "Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company around Him.",
    "Matthew 27:28": "They stripped Him and put a scarlet robe on Him.",
    "Matthew 27:29": "And they twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on His head. They put a staff in His right hand, knelt down before Him, and mocked Him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”",
    "Matthew 27:30": "Then they spit on Him and took the staff and struck Him on the head repeatedly.",
    "Matthew 27:31": "After they had mocked Him, they removed the robe and put His own clothes back on Him. Then they led Him away to crucify Him.",
    "Matthew 27:32": "Along the way they found a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross of Jesus.",
    "Matthew 27:33": "And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means The Place of the Skull,",
    "Matthew 27:34": "they offered Him wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, He refused to drink it.",
    "Matthew 27:35": "When they had crucified Him, they divided up His garments by casting lots.",
    "Matthew 27:36": "And sitting down, they kept watch over Him there.",
    "Matthew 27:37": "Above His head they posted the written charge against Him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.",
    "Matthew 27:38": "Two robbers were crucified with Him, one on His right and the other on His left.",
    "Matthew 27:39": "And those who passed by heaped abuse on Him, shaking their heads",
    "Matthew 27:40": "and saying, “You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross!”",
    "Matthew 27:41": "In the same way, the chief priests, scribes, and elders mocked Him, saying,",
    "Matthew 27:42": "“He saved others, but He cannot save Himself. He is the King of Israel! Let Him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in Him.",
    "Matthew 27:43": "He trusts in God. Let God deliver Him now if He wants Him. For He said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”",
    "Matthew 27:44": "In the same way, even the robbers who were crucified with Him berated Him.",
    "Matthew 27:45": "From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.",
    "Matthew 27:46": "About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” which means, “My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?”",
    "Matthew 27:47": "When some of those standing there heard this, they said, “He is calling Elijah.”",
    "Matthew 27:48": "One of them quickly ran and brought a sponge. He filled it with sour wine, put it on a reed, and held it up for Jesus to drink.",
    "Matthew 27:49": "But the others said, “Leave Him alone. Let us see if Elijah comes to save Him.”",
    "Matthew 27:50": "When Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, He yielded up His spirit.",
    "Matthew 27:51": "At that moment the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth quaked, and the rocks were split.",

    "Matthew 27:53": "After Jesus’ resurrection, when they had come out of the tombs, they entered the holy city and appeared to many people.",
    "Matthew 27:54": "When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified and said, “Truly this was the Son of God.”",
    "Matthew 27:55": "And many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to minister to Him.",
    "Matthew 27:56": "Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons.",
    "Matthew 27:57": "When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, who himself was a disciple of Jesus.",
    "Matthew 27:58": "He went to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him.",
    "Matthew 27:59": "So Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,",
    "Matthew 27:60": "and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut into the rock. Then he rolled a great stone across the entrance to the tomb and went away.",
    "Matthew 27:61": "Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.",
    "Matthew 27:62": "The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and Pharisees assembled before Pilate.",
    "Matthew 27:63": "“Sir,” they said, “we remember that while He was alive that deceiver said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’",
    "Matthew 27:64": "So give the order that the tomb be secured until the third day. Otherwise, His disciples may come and steal Him away and tell the people He has risen from the dead. And this last deception would be worse than the first.”",
    "Matthew 27:65": "“You have a guard,” Pilate said. “Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how.”",
    "Matthew 27:66": "So they went and secured the tomb by sealing the stone and posting the guard.",
    "Matthew 28:1": "After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.",
    "Matthew 28:2": "Suddenly there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, rolled away the stone, and sat on it.",
    "Matthew 28:3": "His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.",
    "Matthew 28:4": "The guards trembled in fear of him and became like dead men.",
    "Matthew 28:5": "But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.",
    "Matthew 28:6": "He is not here; He has risen, just as He said! Come, see the place where He lay.",
    "Matthew 28:7": "Then go quickly and tell His disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see Him.’ See, I have told you.”",
    "Matthew 28:8": "So they hurried away from the tomb in fear and great joy, and ran to tell His disciples.",
    "Matthew 28:9": "Suddenly Jesus met them and said, “Greetings!” They came to Him, grasped His feet, and worshiped Him.",
    "Matthew 28:10": "“Do not be afraid,” said Jesus. “Go and tell My brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see Me.”",
    "Matthew 28:11": "While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened.",
    "Matthew 28:12": "And after the chief priests had met with the elders and formed a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money",
    "Matthew 28:13": "and instructed them: “You are to say, ‘His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.’",
    "Matthew 28:14": "If this report reaches the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.”",
    "Matthew 28:15": "So the guards took the money and did as they were instructed. And this account has been circulated among the Jews to this very day.",
    "Matthew 28:16": "Meanwhile, the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain Jesus had designated.",
    "Matthew 28:17": "When they saw Him, they worshiped Him, but some doubted.",
    "Matthew 28:18": "Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me.",
    "Matthew 28:19": "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,",

    "Mark 1:12": "At once the Spirit drove Jesus into the wilderness,",
    "Mark 1:13": "and He was there for forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels ministered to Him.",
    "Mark 1:14": "After the arrest of John, Jesus went into Galilee and proclaimed the gospel of God.",
    "Mark 1:15": "“The time is fulfilled,” He said, “and the kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe in the gospel!”",
    "Mark 1:16": "As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.",
    "Mark 1:17": "“Come, follow Me,” Jesus said, “and I will make you fishers of men.”",
    "Mark 1:18": "And at once they left their nets and followed Him.",
    "Mark 1:19": "Going on a little farther, He saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat, mending their nets.",
    "Mark 1:20": "Immediately Jesus called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed Him.",
    "Mark 1:21": "Then Jesus and His companions went to Capernaum, and right away Jesus entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and began to teach.",
    "Mark 1:22": "The people were astonished at His teaching, because He taught as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.",
    "Mark 1:23": "Suddenly a man with an unclean spirit cried out in the synagogue:",
    "Mark 1:24": "“What do You want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!”",
    "Mark 1:25": "But Jesus rebuked the spirit. “Be silent!” He said. “Come out of him!”",
    "Mark 1:26": "At this, the unclean spirit threw the man into convulsions and came out with a loud shriek.",
    "Mark 1:27": "All the people were amazed and began to ask one another, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him!”",

    "Mark 1:32": "That evening, after sunset, people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed,",
    "Mark 1:33": "and the whole town gathered at the door.",

    "Mark 1:45": "But the man went out and openly began to proclaim and spread the news. Consequently, Jesus could no longer enter a town in plain view, but He stayed out in solitary places. Yet people came to Him from every quarter.",
    "Mark 2:1": "A few days later Jesus went back to Capernaum. And when the people heard that He was home,",
    "Mark 2:2": "they gathered in such large numbers that there was no more room, not even outside the door, as Jesus spoke the word to them.",
    "Mark 2:3": "Then a paralytic was brought to Him, carried by four men.",
    "Mark 2:4": "Since they were unable to get to Jesus through the crowd, they uncovered the roof above Him, made an opening, and lowered the paralytic on his mat.",
    "Mark 2:5": "When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”",
    "Mark 2:6": "But some of the scribes were sitting there and thinking in their hearts,",
    "Mark 2:7": "“Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?”",
    "Mark 2:8": "At once Jesus knew in His spirit that they were thinking this way within themselves. “Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?” He asked.",
    "Mark 2:9": "“Which is easier: to say to a paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, pick up your mat, and walk’?",
    "Mark 2:10": "But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...” He said to the paralytic,",
    "Mark 2:11": "“I tell you, get up, pick up your mat, and go home.”",
    "Mark 2:12": "And immediately the man got up, picked up his mat, and walked out in front of them all. As a result, they were all astounded and glorified God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”",
    "Mark 2:13": "Once again Jesus went out beside the sea. All the people came to Him, and He taught them there.",
    "Mark 2:14": "As He was walking along, He saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth. “Follow Me,” He told him, and Levi got up and followed Him.",
    "Mark 2:15": "While Jesus was dining at Levi’s house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with Him and His disciples—for there were many who followed Him.",
    "Mark 2:16": "When the scribes who were Pharisees saw Jesus eating with these people, they asked His disciples, “Why does He eat with tax collectors and sinners?”",
    "Mark 2:17": "On hearing this, Jesus told them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”",
    "Mark 2:18": "Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were often fasting. So people came to Jesus and asked, “Why don’t Your disciples fast like John’s disciples and those of the Pharisees?”",
    "Mark 2:19": "Jesus replied, “How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while He is with them? As long as He is with them, they cannot fast.",
    "Mark 2:20": "But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast.",
    "Mark 2:21": "No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the new piece will pull away from the old, and a worse tear will result.",
    "Mark 2:22": "And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. Instead, new wine is poured into new wineskins.”",

    "Mark 2:27": "Then Jesus declared, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.",
    "Mark 2:28": "Therefore, the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”",
    "Mark 3:1": "Once again Jesus entered the synagogue, and a man with a withered hand was there.",
    "Mark 3:2": "In order to accuse Jesus, they were watching to see if He would heal on the Sabbath.",
    "Mark 3:3": "Then Jesus said to the man with the withered hand, “Stand up among us.”",
    "Mark 3:4": "And He asked them, “Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?” But they were silent.",
    "Mark 3:5": "Jesus looked around at them with anger and sorrow at their hardness of heart. Then He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” So he stretched it out, and it was restored.",
    "Mark 3:6": "At this, the Pharisees went out and began plotting with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.",
    "Mark 3:7": "So Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea, accompanied by a large crowd from Galilee, Judea,",
    "Mark 3:8": "Jerusalem, Idumea, the region beyond the Jordan, and the vicinity of Tyre and Sidon. The large crowd came to Him when they heard what great things He was doing.",
    "Mark 3:9": "Jesus asked His disciples to have a boat ready for Him so that the crowd would not crush Him.",
    "Mark 3:10": "For He had healed so many that all who had diseases were pressing forward to touch Him.",

    "Mark 3:12": "But He warned them sternly not to make Him known.",
    "Mark 3:13": "Then Jesus went up on the mountain and called for those He wanted, and they came to Him.",
    "Mark 3:14": "He appointed twelve of them, whom He designated as apostles, to accompany Him, to be sent out to preach,",
    "Mark 3:15": "and to have authority to drive out demons.",
    "Mark 3:16": "These are the twelve He appointed: Simon (whom He named Peter),",
    "Mark 3:17": "James son of Zebedee and his brother John (whom He named Boanerges, meaning “Sons of Thunder”),",
    "Mark 3:18": "Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot,",
    "Mark 3:19": "and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus.",
    "Mark 3:20": "Then Jesus went home, and once again a crowd gathered, so that He and His disciples could not even eat.",
    "Mark 3:21": "When His family heard about this, they went out to take custody of Him, saying, “He is out of His mind.”",
    "Mark 3:22": "And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem were saying, “He is possessed by Beelzebul,” and, “By the prince of the demons He drives out demons.”",
    "Mark 3:23": "So Jesus called them together and began to speak to them in parables: “How can Satan drive out Satan?",
    "Mark 3:24": "If a kingdom is divided against itself, it cannot stand.",
    "Mark 3:25": "If a house is divided against itself, it cannot stand.",
    "Mark 3:26": "And if Satan is divided and rises against himself, he cannot stand; his end has come.",
    "Mark 3:27": "Indeed, no one can enter a strong man’s house to steal his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can plunder his house.",
    "Mark 3:28": "Truly I tell you, the sons of men will be forgiven all sins and blasphemies, as many as they utter.",
    "Mark 3:29": "But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of eternal sin.”",
    "Mark 3:30": "Jesus made this statement because they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”",
    "Mark 3:31": "Then Jesus’ mother and brothers came and stood outside. They sent someone in to summon Him,",
    "Mark 3:32": "and a crowd was sitting around Him. “Look,” He was told, “Your mother and brothers are outside, asking for You.”",
    "Mark 3:33": "But Jesus replied, “Who are My mother and My brothers?”",
    "Mark 3:34": "Looking at those seated in a circle around Him, He said, “Here are My mother and My brothers!",
    "Mark 3:35": "For whoever does the will of God is My brother and sister and mother.”",
    "Mark 4:1": "Once again Jesus began to teach beside the sea, and such a large crowd gathered around Him that He got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people crowded along the shore.",
    "Mark 4:2": "And He taught them many things in parables, and in His teaching He said,",
    "Mark 4:3": "“Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed.",
    "Mark 4:4": "And as he was sowing, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.",
    "Mark 4:5": "Some fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow.",
    "Mark 4:6": "But when the sun rose, the seedlings were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.",
    "Mark 4:7": "Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the seedlings, and they yielded no crop.",
    "Mark 4:8": "Still other seed fell on good soil, where it sprouted, grew up, and produced a crop—one bearing thirtyfold, another sixtyfold, and another a hundredfold.”",
    "Mark 4:9": "Then Jesus said, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”",
    "Mark 4:10": "As soon as Jesus was alone with the Twelve and those around Him, they asked Him about the parable.",
    "Mark 4:11": "He replied, “The mystery of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to those on the outside everything is expressed in parables,",
    "Mark 4:12": "so that, ‘they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven.’”",
    "Mark 4:13": "Then Jesus said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? Then how will you understand any of the parables?",
    "Mark 4:14": "The farmer sows the word.",
    "Mark 4:15": "Some are like the seeds along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.",
    "Mark 4:16": "Some are like the seeds sown on rocky ground. They hear the word and at once receive it with joy.",
    "Mark 4:17": "But they themselves have no root, and they remain for only a season. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.",
    "Mark 4:18": "Others are like the seeds sown among the thorns. They hear the word,",
    "Mark 4:19": "but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth, and the desire for other things come in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.",
    "Mark 4:20": "Still others are like the seeds sown on good soil. They hear the word, receive it, and produce a crop—thirtyfold, sixtyfold, or a hundredfold.”",
    "Mark 4:21": "Jesus also said to them, “Does anyone bring in a lamp to put it under a basket or under a bed? Doesn’t he set it on a stand?",
    "Mark 4:22": "For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be brought to light.",
    "Mark 4:23": "If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.”",
    "Mark 4:24": "He went on to say, “Pay attention to what you hear. With the measure you use, it will be measured to you, and even more will be added to you.",
    "Mark 4:25": "For whoever has will be given more. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.”",
    "Mark 4:26": "Jesus also said, “The kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seed on the ground.",
    "Mark 4:27": "Night and day he sleeps and wakes, and the seed sprouts and grows, though he knows not how.",
    "Mark 4:28": "All by itself the earth produces a crop—first the stalk, then the head, then grain that ripens within.",
    "Mark 4:29": "And as soon as the grain is ripe, he swings the sickle, because the harvest has come.”",
    "Mark 4:30": "Then He asked, “To what can we compare the kingdom of God? With what parable shall we present it?",
    "Mark 4:31": "It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds sown upon the earth.",
    "Mark 4:32": "But after it is planted, it grows to be the largest of all garden plants and puts forth great branches, so that the birds of the air nest in its shade.”",
    "Mark 4:33": "With many such parables Jesus spoke the word to them, to the extent that they could understand.",
    "Mark 4:34": "He did not tell them anything without using a parable. But privately He explained everything to His own disciples.",
    "Mark 4:35": "When that evening came, He said to His disciples, “Let us cross to the other side.”",
    "Mark 4:36": "After they had dismissed the crowd, they took Jesus with them, since He was already in the boat. And there were other boats with Him.",
    "Mark 4:37": "Soon a violent windstorm came up, and the waves were breaking over the boat, so that it was being swamped.",
    "Mark 4:38": "But Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on the cushion. So they woke Him and said, “Teacher, don’t You care that we are perishing?”",
    "Mark 4:39": "Then Jesus got up and rebuked the wind and the sea. “Silence!” He commanded. “Be still!” And the wind died down, and it was perfectly calm.",
    "Mark 4:40": "“Why are you so afraid?” He asked. “Do you still have no faith?”",
    "Mark 4:41": "Overwhelmed with fear, they asked one another, “Who is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?”",
    "Mark 5:1": "On the other side of the sea, they arrived in the region of the Gerasenes.",
    "Mark 5:2": "As soon as Jesus got out of the boat, He was met by a man with an unclean spirit, who was coming from the tombs.",
    "Mark 5:3": "This man had been living in the tombs and could no longer be restrained, even with chains.",
    "Mark 5:4": "Though he was often bound with chains and shackles, he had broken the chains and shattered the shackles. Now there was no one with the strength to subdue him.",
    "Mark 5:5": "Night and day in the tombs and in the mountains he kept crying out and cutting himself with stones.",
    "Mark 5:6": "When the man saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees before Him.",
    "Mark 5:7": "And he shouted in a loud voice, “What do You want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You before God not to torture me!”",
    "Mark 5:8": "For Jesus had already declared, “Come out of this man, you unclean spirit!”",
    "Mark 5:9": "“What is your name?” Jesus asked. “My name is Legion,” he replied, “for we are many.”",
    "Mark 5:10": "And he begged Jesus repeatedly not to send them out of that region.",
    "Mark 5:11": "There on the nearby hillside a large herd of pigs was feeding.",
    "Mark 5:12": "So the demons begged Jesus, “Send us to the pigs, so that we may enter them.”",
    "Mark 5:13": "He gave them permission, and the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs, and the herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the water.",
    "Mark 5:14": "Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.",
    "Mark 5:15": "When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons sitting there, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.",
    "Mark 5:16": "Those who had seen it described what had happened to the demon-possessed man and also to the pigs.",
    "Mark 5:17": "And the people began to beg Jesus to leave their region.",
    "Mark 5:18": "As He was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed by the demons begged to go with Him.",
    "Mark 5:19": "But Jesus would not allow him. “Go home to your own people,” He said, “and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and what mercy He has shown you.”",
    "Mark 5:20": "So the man went away and began to proclaim throughout the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And everyone was amazed.",
    "Mark 5:21": "When Jesus had again crossed by boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around Him beside the sea.",
    "Mark 5:22": "A synagogue leader named Jairus arrived, and seeing Jesus, he fell at His feet",
    "Mark 5:23": "and pleaded with Him urgently, “My little daughter is near death. Please come and place Your hands on her, so that she will be healed and live.”",
    "Mark 5:24": "So Jesus went with him, and a large crowd followed and pressed around Him.",
    "Mark 5:25": "And a woman was there who had suffered from bleeding for twelve years.",
    "Mark 5:26": "She had borne much agony under the care of many physicians and had spent all she had, but to no avail. Instead, her condition had only grown worse.",
    "Mark 5:27": "When the woman heard about Jesus, she came up through the crowd behind Him and touched His cloak.",
    "Mark 5:28": "For she kept saying, “If only I touch His garments, I will be healed.”",
    "Mark 5:29": "Immediately her bleeding stopped, and she sensed in her body that she was healed of her affliction.",
    "Mark 5:30": "At once Jesus was aware that power had gone out from Him. Turning to the crowd, He asked, “Who touched My garments?”",
    "Mark 5:31": "His disciples answered, “You can see the crowd pressing in on You, and yet You ask, ‘Who touched Me?’”",
    "Mark 5:32": "But He kept looking around to see who had done this.",
    "Mark 5:33": "Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him trembling in fear, and she told Him the whole truth.",
    "Mark 5:34": "“Daughter,” said Jesus, “your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be free of your affliction.”",
    "Mark 5:35": "While He was still speaking, messengers from the house of Jairus arrived and said, “Your daughter is dead; why bother the Teacher anymore?”",
    "Mark 5:36": "But Jesus overheard their conversation and said to Jairus, “Do not be afraid; just believe.”",
    "Mark 5:37": "And He did not allow anyone to accompany Him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.",
    "Mark 5:38": "When they arrived at the house of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw the commotion and the people weeping and wailing loudly.",
    "Mark 5:39": "He went inside and asked, “Why all this commotion and weeping? The child is not dead, but asleep.”",
    "Mark 5:40": "And they laughed at Him. After He had put them all outside, He took the child’s father and mother and His own companions, and went in to see the child.",
    "Mark 5:41": "Taking her by the hand, Jesus said, “Talitha koum!” which means, “Little girl, I say to you, get up!”",
    "Mark 5:42": "Immediately the girl got up and began to walk around (she was twelve years old). And at once they were utterly astounded.",
    "Mark 5:43": "Then Jesus gave strict orders that no one should know about this, and He told them to give her something to eat.",
    "Mark 6:1": "Jesus went on from there and came to His hometown, accompanied by His disciples.",
    "Mark 6:2": "When the Sabbath came, He began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard Him were astonished. “Where did this man get these ideas?” they asked. “What is this wisdom He has been given? And how can He perform such miracles?",
    "Mark 6:3": "Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of Mary and the brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? Aren’t His sisters here with us as well?” And they took offense at Him.",
    "Mark 6:4": "Then Jesus said to them, “Only in his hometown, among his relatives, and in his own household is a prophet without honor.”",
    "Mark 6:5": "So He could not perform any miracles there, except to lay His hands on a few of the sick and heal them.",
    "Mark 6:6": "And He was amazed at their unbelief. And He went around from village to village, teaching the people.",
    "Mark 6:7": "Then Jesus called the Twelve to Him and began to send them out two by two, giving them authority over unclean spirits.",
    "Mark 6:8": "He instructed them to take nothing but a staff for the journey—no bread, no bag, no money in their belts—",
    "Mark 6:9": "and to wear sandals, but not a second tunic.",
    "Mark 6:10": "And He told them, “When you enter a house, stay there until you leave that area.",
    "Mark 6:11": "If anyone will not welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that place, as a testimony against them.”",
    "Mark 6:12": "So they set out and preached that the people should repent.",
    "Mark 6:13": "They also drove out many demons and healed many of the sick, anointing them with oil.",
    "Mark 6:14": "Now King Herod heard about this, for Jesus’ name had become well known, and people were saying, “John the Baptist has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”",
    "Mark 6:15": "Others were saying, “He is Elijah,” and still others, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.”",
    "Mark 6:16": "But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has risen from the dead!”",
    "Mark 6:17": "For Herod himself had ordered that John be arrested and bound and imprisoned, on account of his brother Philip’s wife Herodias, whom Herod had married.",
    "Mark 6:18": "For John had been telling Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife!”",
    "Mark 6:19": "So Herodias held a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she had been unable,",
    "Mark 6:20": "because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man. When he heard John’s words, he was greatly perplexed; yet he listened to him gladly.",
    "Mark 6:21": "On Herod’s birthday, her opportunity arose. Herod held a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.",
    "Mark 6:22": "When the daughter of Herodias came and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests, and the king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.”",
    "Mark 6:23": "And he swore to her, “Whatever you ask of me, I will give you, up to half my kingdom!”",
    "Mark 6:24": "Then she went out and asked her mother, “What should I request?” And her mother answered, “The head of John the Baptist.”",
    "Mark 6:25": "At once the girl hurried back to the king with her request: “I want you to give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter immediately.”",
    "Mark 6:26": "The king was consumed with sorrow, but because of his oaths and his guests, he did not want to refuse her.",
    "Mark 6:27": "So without delay, the king commanded that John’s head be brought in. He sent an executioner, who went and beheaded him in the prison.",
    "Mark 6:28": "The man brought John’s head on a platter and presented it to the girl, who gave it to her mother.",
    "Mark 6:29": "When John’s disciples heard about this, they came and took his body and placed it in a tomb.",
    "Mark 6:30": "Meanwhile, the apostles gathered around Jesus and brought Him news of all they had done and taught.",
    "Mark 6:31": "And He said to them, “Come with Me privately to a solitary place, and let us rest for a while.” For many people were coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat.",
    "Mark 6:32": "So they went away in a boat by themselves to a solitary place.",
    "Mark 6:33": "But many people saw them leaving and recognized them. They ran together on foot from all the towns and arrived before them.",
    "Mark 6:34": "When Jesus stepped ashore and saw a large crowd, He had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And He began to teach them many things.",
    "Mark 6:35": "By now the hour was already late. So the disciples came to Jesus and said, “This is a desolate place, and the hour is already late.",
    "Mark 6:36": "Dismiss the crowd so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.”",
    "Mark 6:37": "But Jesus told them, “You give them something to eat.” They asked Him, “Should we go out and spend two hundred denarii to give all of them bread to eat?”",
    "Mark 6:38": "“Go and see how many loaves you have,” He told them. And after checking, they said, “Five—and two fish.”",
    "Mark 6:39": "Then Jesus directed them to have the people sit in groups on the green grass.",
    "Mark 6:40": "So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.",
    "Mark 6:41": "Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, Jesus spoke a blessing and broke the loaves. Then He gave them to His disciples to set before the people. And He divided the two fish among them all.",
    "Mark 6:42": "They all ate and were satisfied,",
    "Mark 6:43": "and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish.",
    "Mark 6:44": "And there were five thousand men who had eaten the loaves.",
    "Mark 6:45": "Immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of Him to Bethsaida, while He dismissed the crowd.",
    "Mark 6:46": "After bidding them farewell, He went up on the mountain to pray.",
    "Mark 6:47": "When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and Jesus was alone on land.",
    "Mark 6:48": "He could see that the disciples were straining to row, because the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went out to them, walking on the sea. He intended to pass by them,",
    "Mark 6:49": "but when they saw Him walking on the sea, they cried out, thinking He was a ghost—",
    "Mark 6:50": "for they all saw Him and were terrified. But Jesus spoke up at once: “Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.”",
    "Mark 6:51": "Then He climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. And the disciples were utterly astounded,",
    "Mark 6:52": "for they had not understood about the loaves, but their hearts had been hardened.",
    "Mark 6:53": "When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and moored the boat.",
    "Mark 6:54": "As soon as they got out of the boat, the people recognized Jesus",
    "Mark 6:55": "and ran through that whole region, carrying the sick on mats to wherever they heard He was.",
    "Mark 6:56": "And wherever He went—villages and towns and countrysides—they laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged Him just to let them touch the fringe of His cloak. And all who touched Him were healed.",
    "Mark 7:1": "Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus,",
    "Mark 7:2": "and they saw some of His disciples eating with hands that were defiled—that is, unwashed.",
    "Mark 7:3": "Now in holding to the tradition of the elders, the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat until they wash their hands ceremonially.",
    "Mark 7:4": "And on returning from the market, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other traditions for them to observe, including the washing of cups, pitchers, kettles, and couches for dining.",
    "Mark 7:5": "So the Pharisees and scribes questioned Jesus: “Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders? Instead, they eat with defiled hands.”",
    "Mark 7:6": "Jesus answered them, “Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written: ‘These people honor Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me.",
    "Mark 7:7": "They worship Me in vain; they teach as doctrine the precepts of men.’",
    "Mark 7:8": "You have disregarded the commandment of God to keep the tradition of men.”",
    "Mark 7:9": "He went on to say, “You neatly set aside the command of God to maintain your own tradition.",
    "Mark 7:10": "For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother’ and ‘Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.’",
    "Mark 7:11": "But you say that if a man says to his father or mother, ‘Whatever you would have received from me is Corban’ (that is, a gift devoted to God),",
    "Mark 7:12": "he is no longer permitted to do anything for his father or mother.",
    "Mark 7:13": "Thus you nullify the word of God by the tradition you have handed down. And you do so in many such matters.”",
    "Mark 7:14": "Once again Jesus called the crowd to Him and said, “All of you, listen to Me and understand:",
    "Mark 7:15": "Nothing that enters a man from the outside can defile him; but the things that come out of a man, these are what defile him.”",
    "Mark 7:16": "",
    "Mark 7:17": "After Jesus had left the crowd and gone into the house, His disciples inquired about the parable.",
    "Mark 7:18": "“Are you still so dull?” He asked. “Do you not understand? Nothing that enters a man from the outside can defile him,",
    "Mark 7:19": "because it does not enter his heart, but it goes into the stomach and then is eliminated.” (Thus all foods are clean.)",
    "Mark 7:20": "He continued: “What comes out of a man, that is what defiles him.",
    "Mark 7:21": "For from within the hearts of men come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,",
    "Mark 7:22": "greed, wickedness, deceit, debauchery, envy, slander, arrogance, and foolishness.",
    "Mark 7:23": "All these evils come from within, and these are what defile a man.”",
    "Mark 7:24": "Jesus left that place and went to the region of Tyre. Not wanting anyone to know He was there, He entered a house, but was unable to escape their notice.",
    "Mark 7:25": "Instead, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit soon heard about Jesus, and she came and fell at His feet.",
    "Mark 7:26": "Now she was a Greek woman of Syrophoenician origin, and she kept asking Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.",
    "Mark 7:27": "“First let the children have their fill,” He said. “For it is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.”",
    "Mark 7:28": "“Yes, Lord,” she replied, “even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”",
    "Mark 7:29": "Then Jesus told her, “Because of this answer, you may go. The demon has left your daughter.”",
    "Mark 7:30": "And she went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon was gone.",
    "Mark 7:31": "Then Jesus left the region of Tyre and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis.",
    "Mark 7:32": "Some people brought to Him a man who was deaf and hardly able to speak, and they begged Jesus to place His hand on him.",
    "Mark 7:33": "So Jesus took him aside privately, away from the crowd, and put His fingers into the man’s ears. Then He spit and touched the man’s tongue.",
    "Mark 7:34": "And looking up to heaven, He sighed deeply and said to him, “Ephphatha!” (which means, “Be opened!”).",
    "Mark 7:35": "Immediately the man’s ears were opened and his tongue was released, and he began to speak plainly.",
    "Mark 7:36": "Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone. But the more He ordered them, the more widely they proclaimed it.",
    "Mark 7:37": "The people were utterly astonished and said, “He has done all things well! He makes even the deaf hear and the mute speak!”",
    "Mark 8:1": "In those days the crowd once again became very large, and they had nothing to eat. Jesus called the disciples to Him and said,",
    "Mark 8:2": "“I have compassion for this crowd, because they have already been with Me three days and have nothing to eat.",
    "Mark 8:3": "If I send them home hungry, they will faint along the way. For some of them have come a great distance.”",
    "Mark 8:4": "His disciples replied, “Where in this desolate place could anyone find enough bread to feed all these people?”",
    "Mark 8:5": "“How many loaves do you have?” Jesus asked. “Seven,” they replied.",
    "Mark 8:6": "And He instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground. Then He took the seven loaves, gave thanks and broke them, and gave them to His disciples to set before the people. And they distributed them to the crowd.",
    "Mark 8:7": "They also had a few small fish, and Jesus blessed them and ordered that these be set before them as well.",
    "Mark 8:8": "The people ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.",
    "Mark 8:9": "And about four thousand men were present. And when Jesus had dismissed the crowd,",
    "Mark 8:10": "He immediately got into the boat with His disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha.",
    "Mark 8:11": "Then the Pharisees came and began to argue with Jesus, testing Him by demanding from Him a sign from heaven.",
    "Mark 8:12": "Jesus sighed deeply in His spirit and said, “Why does this generation demand a sign? Truly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation.”",
    "Mark 8:13": "And He left them, got back into the boat, and crossed to the other side.",
    "Mark 8:14": "Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat.",
    "Mark 8:15": "“Watch out!” He cautioned them. “Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of Herod.”",
    "Mark 8:16": "So they began to discuss with one another the fact that they had no bread.",
    "Mark 8:17": "Aware of their conversation, Jesus asked them, “Why are you debating about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Do you have such hard hearts?",
    "Mark 8:18": "‘Having eyes, do you not see? And having ears, do you not hear?’ And do you not remember?",
    "Mark 8:19": "When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of broken pieces did you collect?” “Twelve,” they answered.",
    "Mark 8:20": "“And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of broken pieces did you collect?” “Seven,” they said.",
    "Mark 8:21": "Then He asked them, “Do you still not understand?”",
    "Mark 8:22": "When they arrived at Bethsaida, some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him.",
    "Mark 8:23": "So He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village. Then He spit on the man’s eyes and placed His hands on him. “Can you see anything?” He asked.",
    "Mark 8:24": "The man looked up and said, “I can see the people, but they look like trees walking around.”",
    "Mark 8:25": "Once again Jesus placed His hands on the man’s eyes, and when he opened them his sight was restored, and he could see everything clearly.",
    "Mark 8:26": "Jesus sent him home and said, “Do not go back into the village.”",
    "Mark 8:27": "Then Jesus and His disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way, He questioned His disciples: “Who do people say I am?”",
    "Mark 8:28": "They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets.”",
    "Mark 8:29": "“But what about you?” Jesus asked. “Who do you say I am?” Peter answered, “You are the Christ.”",
    "Mark 8:30": "And Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about Him.",
    "Mark 8:31": "Then He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and that He must be killed and after three days rise again.",
    "Mark 8:32": "He spoke this message quite frankly, and Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him.",
    "Mark 8:33": "But Jesus, turning and looking at His disciples, rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind Me, Satan! For you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men.”",
    "Mark 8:34": "Then Jesus called the crowd to Him along with His disciples, and He told them, “If anyone wants to come after Me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me.",
    "Mark 8:35": "For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake and for the gospel will save it.",
    "Mark 8:36": "What does it profit a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul?",
    "Mark 8:37": "Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?",
    "Mark 8:38": "If anyone is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in His Father’s glory with the holy angels.”",
    "Mark 9:1": "Then Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God arrive with power.”",
    "Mark 9:2": "After six days Jesus took with Him Peter, James, and John, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. There He was transfigured before them.",
    "Mark 9:3": "His clothes became radiantly white, brighter than any launderer on earth could bleach them.",
    "Mark 9:4": "And Elijah and Moses appeared before them, talking with Jesus.",
    "Mark 9:5": "Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”",
    "Mark 9:6": "For they were all so terrified that Peter did not know what else to say.",
    "Mark 9:7": "Then a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and a voice came from the cloud: “This is My beloved Son. Listen to Him!”",
    "Mark 9:8": "Suddenly, when they looked around, they saw no one with them except Jesus.",
    "Mark 9:9": "As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus admonished them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.",
    "Mark 9:10": "So they kept this matter to themselves, discussing what it meant to rise from the dead.",
    "Mark 9:11": "And they asked Jesus, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”",
    "Mark 9:12": "He replied, “Elijah does indeed come first, and he restores all things. Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected?",
    "Mark 9:13": "But I tell you that Elijah has indeed come, and they have done to him whatever they wished, just as it is written about him.”",
    "Mark 9:14": "When they returned to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them.",
    "Mark 9:15": "As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were filled with awe and ran to greet Him.",
    "Mark 9:16": "“What are you disputing with them?” He asked.",
    "Mark 9:17": "Someone in the crowd replied, “Teacher, I brought You my son, who has a spirit that makes him mute.",
    "Mark 9:18": "Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked Your disciples to drive it out, but they were unable.”",
    "Mark 9:19": "“O unbelieving generation!” Jesus replied. “How long must I remain with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy to Me.”",
    "Mark 9:20": "So they brought him, and seeing Jesus, the spirit immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.",
    "Mark 9:21": "Jesus asked the boy’s father, “How long has this been with him?” “From childhood,” he said.",
    "Mark 9:22": "“It often throws him into the fire or into the water, trying to kill him. But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.”",
    "Mark 9:23": "“If You can?” echoed Jesus. “All things are possible to him who believes!”",
    "Mark 9:24": "Immediately the boy’s father cried out, “I do believe; help my unbelief!”",
    "Mark 9:25": "When Jesus saw that a crowd had come running, He rebuked the unclean spirit. “You deaf and mute spirit,” He said, “I command you to come out and never enter him again.”",
    "Mark 9:26": "After shrieking and convulsing him violently, the spirit came out. The boy became like a corpse, so that many said, “He is dead.”",
    "Mark 9:27": "But Jesus took him by the hand and helped him to his feet, and he stood up.",
    "Mark 9:28": "After Jesus had gone into the house, His disciples asked Him privately, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?”",
    "Mark 9:29": "Jesus answered, “This kind cannot come out, except by prayer.”",
    "Mark 9:30": "Going on from there, they passed through Galilee. But Jesus did not want anyone to know,",
    "Mark 9:31": "because He was teaching His disciples. He told them, “The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill Him, and after three days He will rise.”",
    "Mark 9:32": "But they did not understand this statement, and they were afraid to ask Him about it.",
    "Mark 9:33": "Then they came to Capernaum. While Jesus was in the house, He asked them, “What were you discussing on the way?”",
    "Mark 9:34": "But they were silent, for on the way they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest.",
    "Mark 9:35": "Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, “If anyone wants to be first, he must be the last of all and the servant of all.”",
    "Mark 9:36": "Then He had a little child stand among them. Taking the child in His arms, He said to them,",
    "Mark 9:37": "“Whoever welcomes one of these little children in My name welcomes Me, and whoever welcomes Me welcomes not only Me, but the One who sent Me.”",
    "Mark 9:38": "John said to Him, “Teacher, we saw someone else driving out demons in Your name, and we tried to stop him, because he does not accompany us.”",
    "Mark 9:39": "“Do not stop him,” Jesus replied. “For no one who performs a miracle in My name can turn around and speak evil of Me.",
    "Mark 9:40": "For whoever is not against us is for us.",
    "Mark 9:41": "Indeed, if anyone gives you even a cup of water because you bear the name of Christ, truly I tell you, he will never lose his reward.",
    "Mark 9:42": "But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be thrown into the sea.",
    "Mark 9:43": "If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two hands and go into hell, into the unquenchable fire.",
    "Mark 9:44": "",
    "Mark 9:45": "If your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame than to have two feet and be thrown into hell.",
    "Mark 9:46": "",
    "Mark 9:47": "And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell,",
    "Mark 9:48": "where ‘their worm never dies, and the fire is never quenched.’",
    "Mark 9:49": "For everyone will be salted with fire.",
    "Mark 9:50": "Salt is good, but if the salt loses its saltiness, with what will you season it? Have salt among yourselves, and be at peace with one another.”",
    "Mark 10:1": "Then Jesus left that place and went into the region of Judea, beyond the Jordan. Again the crowds came to Him and He taught them, as was His custom.",
    "Mark 10:2": "Some Pharisees came to test Him. “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?” they inquired.",
    "Mark 10:3": "“What did Moses command you?” He replied.",
    "Mark 10:4": "They answered, “Moses permitted a man to write his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away.”",
    "Mark 10:5": "But Jesus told them, “Moses wrote this commandment for you because of your hardness of heart.",
    "Mark 10:6": "However, from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.’",
    "Mark 10:7": "‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife,",
    "Mark 10:8": "and the two will become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two, but one flesh.",

    "Mark 10:10": "When they were back inside the house, the disciples asked Jesus about this matter.",
    "Mark 10:11": "So He told them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.",
    "Mark 10:12": "And if a woman divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.”",
    "Mark 10:13": "Now people were bringing the little children to Jesus for Him to place His hands on them, and the disciples rebuked those who brought them.",
    "Mark 10:14": "But when Jesus saw this, He was indignant and told them, “Let the little children come to Me, and do not hinder them! For the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.",
    "Mark 10:15": "Truly I tell you, anyone who does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”",
    "Mark 10:16": "And He took the children in His arms, placed His hands on them, and blessed them.",
    "Mark 10:17": "As Jesus started on His way, a man ran up and knelt before Him. “Good Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”",
    "Mark 10:18": "“Why do you call Me good?” Jesus replied. “No one is good except God alone.",
    "Mark 10:19": "You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not cheat others, honor your father and mother.’”",
    "Mark 10:20": "“Teacher,” he replied, “all these I have kept from my youth.”",
    "Mark 10:21": "Jesus looked at him, loved him, and said to him, “There is one thing you lack: Go, sell everything you own and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me.”",
    "Mark 10:22": "But the man was saddened by these words and went away in sorrow, because he had great wealth.",
    "Mark 10:23": "Then Jesus looked around and said to His disciples, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!”",
    "Mark 10:24": "And the disciples were amazed at His words. But Jesus said to them again, “Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!",
    "Mark 10:25": "It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”",
    "Mark 10:26": "They were even more astonished and said to one another, “Who then can be saved?”",
    "Mark 10:27": "Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God.”",
    "Mark 10:28": "Peter began to say to Him, “Look, we have left everything and followed You.”",
    "Mark 10:29": "“Truly I tell you,” Jesus replied, “no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for My sake and for the gospel",
    "Mark 10:30": "will fail to receive a hundredfold in the present age—houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields, along with persecutions—and in the age to come, eternal life.",

    "Mark 10:32": "As they were going up the road to Jerusalem, Jesus was walking ahead of them. The disciples were amazed, but those who followed were afraid. Again Jesus took the Twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to Him:",
    "Mark 10:33": "“Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and scribes. They will condemn Him to death and will deliver Him over to the Gentiles,",

    "Mark 10:35": "Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Jesus and declared, “Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask.”",
    "Mark 10:36": "“What do you want Me to do for you?” He inquired.",
    "Mark 10:37": "They answered, “Grant that one of us may sit at Your right hand and the other at Your left in Your glory.”",
    "Mark 10:38": "“You do not know what you are asking,” Jesus replied. “Can you drink the cup I will drink, or be baptized with the baptism I will undergo?”",
    "Mark 10:39": "“We can,” the brothers answered. “You will drink the cup that I drink,” Jesus said, “and you will be baptized with the baptism that I undergo.",
    "Mark 10:40": "But to sit at My right or left is not Mine to grant. These seats belong to those for whom they have been prepared.”",
    "Mark 10:41": "When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John.",

    "Mark 10:44": "and whoever wants to be first must be the slave of all.",

    "Mark 10:50": "Throwing off his cloak, Bartimaeus jumped up and came to Jesus.",
    "Mark 10:51": "“What do you want Me to do for you?” Jesus asked. “Rabboni,” said the blind man, “let me see again.”",
    "Mark 10:52": "“Go,” said Jesus, “your faith has healed you.” And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.",
    "Mark 11:1": "As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent out two of His disciples",
    "Mark 11:2": "and said to them, “Go into the village ahead of you, and as soon as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here.",
    "Mark 11:3": "If anyone asks, ‘Why are you doing this?’ tell him, ‘The Lord needs it and will return it shortly.’”",
    "Mark 11:4": "So they went and found the colt outside in the street, tied at a doorway. They untied it,",
    "Mark 11:5": "and some who were standing there asked, “Why are you untying the colt?”",
    "Mark 11:6": "The disciples answered as Jesus had instructed them, and the people gave them permission.",

    "Mark 12:43": "Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, “Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put more than all the others into the treasury.",

    "Mark 14:20": "He answered, “It is one of the Twelve—the one who is dipping his hand into the bowl with Me.",
    "Mark 14:21": "The Son of Man will go just as it is written about Him, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed! It would be better for him if he had not been born.”",
    "Mark 14:22": "While they were eating, Jesus took bread, spoke a blessing and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, saying, “Take it; this is My body.”",

    "Mark 14:31": "But Peter kept insisting, “Even if I have to die with You, I will never deny You.” And all the others said the same thing.",
    "Mark 14:32": "Then they came to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus told His disciples, “Sit here while I pray.”",
    "Mark 14:33": "He took with Him Peter, James, and John, and began to be deeply troubled and distressed.",
    "Mark 14:34": "Then He said to them, “My soul is consumed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch.”",
    "Mark 14:35": "Going a little farther, He fell to the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour would pass from Him.",
    "Mark 14:36": "“Abba, Father,” He said, “all things are possible for You. Take this cup from Me. Yet not what I will, but what You will.”",
    "Mark 14:37": "Then Jesus returned and found them sleeping. “Simon, are you asleep?” He asked. “Were you not able to keep watch for one hour?",
    "Mark 14:38": "Watch and pray so that you will not enter into temptation. For the spirit is willing, but the body is weak.”",
    "Mark 14:39": "Again He went away and prayed, saying the same thing.",
    "Mark 14:40": "And again Jesus returned and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. And they did not know what to answer Him.",
    "Mark 14:41": "When Jesus returned the third time, He said, “Are you still sleeping and resting? That is enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.",
    "Mark 14:42": "Rise, let us go. See, My betrayer is approaching!”",
    "Mark 14:43": "While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, accompanied by a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, scribes, and elders.",
    "Mark 14:44": "Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The One I kiss is the man; arrest Him and lead Him away securely.”",
    "Mark 14:45": "Going directly to Jesus, he said, “Rabbi!” and kissed Him.",
    "Mark 14:46": "Then the men seized Jesus and arrested Him.",
    "Mark 14:47": "And one of the bystanders drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.",
    "Mark 14:48": "Jesus asked the crowd, “Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me as you would an outlaw?",
    "Mark 14:49": "Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest Me. But this has happened that the Scriptures would be fulfilled.”",
    "Mark 14:50": "Then everyone deserted Him and fled.",
    "Mark 14:51": "One young man who had been following Jesus was wearing a linen cloth around his body. They caught hold of him,",
    "Mark 14:52": "but he pulled free of the linen cloth and ran away naked.",
    "Mark 14:53": "They led Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests, elders, and scribes assembled.",
    "Mark 14:54": "Peter followed Him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. And he sat with the officers and warmed himself by the fire.",
    "Mark 14:55": "Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, but they did not find any.",
    "Mark 14:56": "For many bore false witness against Jesus, but their testimony was inconsistent.",
    "Mark 14:57": "Then some men stood up and testified falsely against Him:",
    "Mark 14:58": "“We heard Him say, ‘I will destroy this man-made temple, and in three days I will build another that is made without hands.’”",
    "Mark 14:59": "But even their testimony was inconsistent.",
    "Mark 14:60": "So the high priest stood up before them and questioned Jesus, “Have You no answer? What are these men testifying against You?”",
    "Mark 14:61": "But Jesus remained silent and made no reply. Again the high priest questioned Him, “Are You the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?”",
    "Mark 14:62": "“I am,” said Jesus, “and you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming with the clouds of heaven.”",
    "Mark 14:63": "At this, the high priest tore his clothes and declared, “Why do we need any more witnesses?",
    "Mark 14:64": "You have heard the blasphemy. What is your verdict?” And they all condemned Him as deserving of death.",
    "Mark 14:65": "Then some of them began to spit on Him. They blindfolded Him, struck Him with their fists, and said to Him, “Prophesy!” And the officers received Him with slaps in His face.",
    "Mark 14:66": "While Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the servant girls of the high priest came down",
    "Mark 14:67": "and saw him warming himself there. She looked at Peter and said, “You also were with Jesus the Nazarene.”",
    "Mark 14:68": "But he denied it. “I do not know or even understand what you are talking about,” he said. Then he went out to the gateway, and the rooster crowed.",
    "Mark 14:69": "There the servant girl saw him and again said to those standing nearby, “This man is one of them.”",
    "Mark 14:70": "But he denied it again. After a little while, those standing nearby said once more to Peter, “Surely you are one of them, for you too are a Galilean.”",
    "Mark 14:71": "But he began to curse and swear, “I do not know this man of whom you speak!”",
    "Mark 14:72": "And immediately the rooster crowed a second time. Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken to him: “Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times.” And he broke down and wept.",
    "Mark 15:1": "Early in the morning, the chief priests, elders, scribes, and the whole Sanhedrin devised a plan. They bound Jesus, led Him away, and handed Him over to Pilate.",
    "Mark 15:2": "So Pilate questioned Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” “You have said so,” Jesus replied.",
    "Mark 15:3": "And the chief priests began to accuse Him of many things.",
    "Mark 15:4": "Then Pilate questioned Him again, “Have You no answer? Look how many charges they are bringing against You!”",
    "Mark 15:5": "But to Pilate’s amazement, Jesus made no further reply.",
    "Mark 15:6": "Now it was Pilate’s custom at the feast to release to the people a prisoner of their choosing.",
    "Mark 15:7": "And a man named Barabbas was imprisoned with the rebels who had committed murder during the insurrection.",
    "Mark 15:8": "So the crowd went up and began asking Pilate to keep his custom.",
    "Mark 15:9": "“Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?” Pilate asked.",
    "Mark 15:10": "For he knew it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over.",
    "Mark 15:11": "But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release Barabbas to them instead.",
    "Mark 15:12": "So Pilate asked them again, “What then do you want me to do with the One you call the King of the Jews?”",
    "Mark 15:13": "And they shouted back, “Crucify Him!”",
    "Mark 15:14": "“Why?” asked Pilate. “What evil has He done?” But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify Him!”",
    "Mark 15:15": "And wishing to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed Him over to be crucified.",
    "Mark 15:16": "Then the soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called the whole company together.",
    "Mark 15:17": "They dressed Him in a purple robe, twisted together a crown of thorns, and set it on His head.",
    "Mark 15:18": "And they began to salute Him: “Hail, King of the Jews!”",
    "Mark 15:19": "They kept striking His head with a staff and spitting on Him. And they knelt down and bowed before Him.",
    "Mark 15:20": "After they had mocked Him, they removed the purple robe and put His own clothes back on Him. Then they led Him out to crucify Him.",
    "Mark 15:21": "Now Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and the soldiers forced him to carry the cross of Jesus.",
    "Mark 15:22": "They brought Jesus to a place called Golgotha, which means The Place of the Skull.",
    "Mark 15:23": "There they offered Him wine mixed with myrrh, but He did not take it.",
    "Mark 15:24": "And they crucified Him. They also divided His garments by casting lots to decide what each of them would take.",
    "Mark 15:25": "It was the third hour when they crucified Him.",
    "Mark 15:26": "And the charge inscribed against Him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS.",
    "Mark 15:27": "Along with Jesus, they crucified two robbers, one on His right and one on His left.",
    "Mark 15:28": "",
    "Mark 15:29": "And those who passed by heaped abuse on Him, shaking their heads and saying, “Aha! You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,",
    "Mark 15:30": "come down from the cross and save Yourself!”",
    "Mark 15:31": "In the same way, the chief priests and scribes mocked Him among themselves, saying, “He saved others, but He cannot save Himself!",
    "Mark 15:32": "Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and believe!” And even those who were crucified with Him berated Him.",
    "Mark 15:33": "From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.",
    "Mark 15:34": "At the ninth hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?” which means, “My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?”",
    "Mark 15:35": "When some of those standing nearby heard this, they said, “Behold, He is calling Elijah.”",
    "Mark 15:36": "And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine. He put it on a reed and held it up for Jesus to drink, saying, “Leave Him alone. Let us see if Elijah comes to take Him down.”",
    "Mark 15:37": "But Jesus let out a loud cry and breathed His last.",
    "Mark 15:38": "And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.",
    "Mark 15:39": "When the centurion standing there in front of Jesus saw how He had breathed His last, he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!”",
    "Mark 15:40": "And there were also women watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.",
    "Mark 15:41": "These women had followed Jesus and ministered to Him while He was in Galilee, and there were many other women who had come up to Jerusalem with Him.",
    "Mark 15:42": "Now it was already evening. Since it was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath),",
    "Mark 15:43": "Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent Council member who himself was waiting for the kingdom of God, boldly went to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus.",
    "Mark 15:44": "Pilate was surprised to hear that Jesus was already dead, so he summoned the centurion to ask if this was so.",
    "Mark 15:45": "When Pilate had confirmed it with the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.",
    "Mark 15:46": "So Joseph bought a linen cloth, took down the body of Jesus, wrapped it in the cloth, and placed it in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb.",
    "Mark 15:47": "Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw where His body was placed.",
    "Mark 16:1": "When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so they could go and anoint the body of Jesus.",
    "Mark 16:2": "Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they went to the tomb.",
    "Mark 16:3": "They were asking one another, “Who will roll away the stone from the entrance of the tomb?”",
    "Mark 16:4": "But when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away, even though it was extremely large.",
    "Mark 16:5": "When they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.",
    "Mark 16:6": "But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here! See the place where they put Him.",
    "Mark 16:7": "But go, tell His disciples and Peter, ‘He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see Him, just as He told you.’”",

    "Mark 16:11": "And when they heard that Jesus was alive and she had seen Him, they did not believe it.",
    "Mark 16:12": "After this, Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them as they walked along in the country.",

    "Luke 7:29": "All the people who heard this, even the tax collectors, acknowledged God’s justice. For they had received the baptism of John.",
    "Luke 7:30": "But the Pharisees and experts in the law rejected God’s purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.",
    "Luke 7:31": "“To what, then, can I compare the men of this generation? What are they like?",
    "Luke 7:32": "They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to one another: ‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.’",

    "Luke 7:42": "When they were unable to repay him, he forgave both of them. Which one, then, will love him more?”",
    "Luke 7:43": "“I suppose the one who was forgiven more,” Simon replied. “You have judged correctly,” Jesus said.",
    "Luke 7:44": "And turning toward the woman, He said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? When I entered your house, you did not give Me water for My feet, but she wet My feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.",

    "Luke 8:4": "While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, He told them this parable:",
    "Luke 8:5": "“A farmer went out to sow his seed. And as he was sowing, some seed fell along the path, where it was trampled, and the birds of the air devoured it.",
    "Luke 8:6": "Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the seedlings withered because they had no moisture.",
    "Luke 8:7": "Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the seedlings.",
    "Luke 8:8": "Still other seed fell on good soil, where it sprang up and produced a crop—a hundredfold.” As Jesus said this, He called out, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”",
    "Luke 8:9": "Then His disciples asked Him what this parable meant.",
    "Luke 8:10": "He replied, “The knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, ‘though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.’",
    "Luke 8:11": "Now this is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God.",
    "Luke 8:12": "The seeds along the path are those who hear, but the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.",
    "Luke 8:13": "The seeds on rocky ground are those who hear the word and receive it with joy, but they have no root. They believe for a season, but in the time of testing, they fall away.",
    "Luke 8:14": "The seeds that fell among the thorns are those who hear, but as they go on their way, they are choked by the worries, riches, and pleasures of this life, and their fruit does not mature.",
    "Luke 8:15": "But the seeds on good soil are those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, cling to it, and by persevering produce a crop.",
    "Luke 8:16": "No one lights a lamp and covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, he sets it on a stand, so those who enter can see the light.",
    "Luke 8:17": "For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be made known and brought to light.",
    "Luke 8:18": "Pay attention, therefore, to how you listen. Whoever has will be given more, but whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him.”",
    "Luke 8:19": "Then Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see Him, but they were unable to reach Him because of the crowd.",
    "Luke 8:20": "He was told, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see You.”",

    "Luke 8:24": "The disciples went and woke Him, saying, “Master, Master, we are perishing!” Then Jesus got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters, and they subsided, and all was calm.",
    "Luke 8:25": "“Where is your faith?” He asked. Frightened and amazed, they asked one another, “Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey Him!”",
    "Luke 8:26": "Then they sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, across the lake from Galilee.",
    "Luke 8:27": "When Jesus stepped ashore, He was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothing or lived in a house, but he stayed in the tombs.",

    "Luke 8:29": "For Jesus had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was bound with chains and shackles, he had broken the chains and been driven by the demon into solitary places.",
    "Luke 8:30": "“What is your name?” Jesus asked. “Legion,” he replied, because many demons had gone into him.",
    "Luke 8:31": "And the demons kept begging Jesus not to order them to go into the Abyss.",
    "Luke 8:32": "There on the hillside a large herd of pigs was feeding. So the demons begged Jesus to let them enter the pigs, and He gave them permission.",
    "Luke 8:33": "Then the demons came out of the man and went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.",
    "Luke 8:34": "When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside.",
    "Luke 8:35": "So the people went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus and found the man whom the demons had left, sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.",
    "Luke 8:36": "Meanwhile, those who had seen it reported how the demon-possessed man had been healed.",
    "Luke 8:37": "Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to depart from them, because great fear had taken hold of them. So He got into the boat and started back.",
    "Luke 8:38": "The man whom the demons had left begged to go with Jesus. But He sent him away, saying,",
    "Luke 8:39": "“Return home and describe how much God has done for you.” So the man went away and proclaimed all over the town how much Jesus had done for him.",
    "Luke 8:40": "When Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed Him, for they had all been waiting for Him.",
    "Luke 8:41": "Just then a synagogue leader named Jairus came and fell at Jesus’ feet. He begged Him to come to his house,",
    "Luke 8:42": "because his only daughter, who was about twelve, was dying. As Jesus went with him, the crowds pressed around Him,",
    "Luke 8:43": "including a woman who had suffered from bleeding for twelve years. She had spent all her money on physicians, but no one was able to heal her.",
    "Luke 8:44": "She came up behind Jesus and touched the fringe of His cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped.",
    "Luke 8:45": "“Who touched Me?” Jesus asked. But they all denied it. “Master,” said Peter, “the people are crowding and pressing against You.”",
    "Luke 8:46": "But Jesus declared, “Someone touched Me, for I know that power has gone out from Me.”",
    "Luke 8:47": "Then the woman, seeing that she could not escape notice, came trembling and fell down before Him. In the presence of all the people, she explained why she had touched Him and how she had immediately been healed.",
    "Luke 8:48": "“Daughter,” said Jesus, “your faith has healed you. Go in peace.”",
    "Luke 8:49": "While He was still speaking, someone arrived from the house of the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” he told Jairus. “Do not bother the Teacher anymore.”",
    "Luke 8:50": "But Jesus overheard them and said to Jairus, “Do not be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.”",
    "Luke 8:51": "When He entered the house, He did not allow anyone to go in with Him except Peter, John, James, and the child’s father and mother.",
    "Luke 8:52": "Meanwhile, everyone was weeping and mourning for her. But Jesus said, “Stop weeping; she is not dead but asleep.”",

    "Luke 9:6": "So they set out and went from village to village, preaching the gospel and healing people everywhere.",
    "Luke 9:7": "When Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, he was perplexed. For some were saying that John had risen from the dead,",
    "Luke 9:8": "others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that a prophet of old had arisen.",
    "Luke 9:9": "“I beheaded John,” Herod said, “but who is this man I hear such things about?” And he kept trying to see Jesus.",
    "Luke 9:10": "Then the apostles returned and reported to Jesus all that they had done. Taking them away privately, He withdrew to a town called Bethsaida.",

    "Luke 9:28": "About eight days after Jesus had said these things, He took with Him Peter, John, and James, and went up on a mountain to pray.",
    "Luke 9:29": "And as He was praying, the appearance of His face changed, and His clothes became radiantly white.",
    "Luke 9:30": "Suddenly two men, Moses and Elijah, began talking with Jesus.",
    "Luke 9:31": "They appeared in glory and spoke about His departure, which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.",
    "Luke 9:32": "Meanwhile Peter and his companions were overcome by sleep, but when they awoke, they saw Jesus’ glory and the two men standing with Him.",
    "Luke 9:33": "As Moses and Elijah were leaving, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” (He did not know what he was saying.)",
    "Luke 9:34": "While Peter was speaking, a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.",
    "Luke 9:35": "And a voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is My Son, whom I have chosen. Listen to Him!”",
    "Luke 9:36": "After the voice had spoken, only Jesus was present with them. The disciples kept this to themselves, and in those days they did not tell anyone what they had seen.",
    "Luke 9:37": "The next day, when they came down from the mountain, Jesus was met by a large crowd.",
    "Luke 9:38": "Suddenly a man in the crowd cried out, “Teacher, I beg You to look at my son, for he is my only child.",
    "Luke 9:39": "A spirit keeps seizing him, and he screams abruptly. It throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It keeps mauling him and rarely departs from him.",
    "Luke 9:40": "I begged Your disciples to drive it out, but they were unable.”",
    "Luke 9:41": "“O unbelieving and perverse generation!” Jesus replied. “How long must I remain with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.”",
    "Luke 9:42": "Even while the boy was approaching, the demon slammed him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.",
    "Luke 9:43": "And they were all astonished at the greatness of God. While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus was doing, He said to His disciples,",
    "Luke 9:44": "“Let these words sink into your ears: The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.”",
    "Luke 9:45": "But they did not understand this statement. It was veiled from them so that they could not comprehend it, and they were afraid to ask Him about it.",
    "Luke 9:46": "Then an argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest.",
    "Luke 9:47": "But Jesus, knowing the thoughts of their hearts, had a little child stand beside Him.",
    "Luke 9:48": "And He said to them, “Whoever welcomes this little child in My name welcomes Me, and whoever welcomes Me welcomes the One who sent Me. For whoever is the least among all of you, he is the greatest.”",
    "Luke 9:49": "“Master,” said John, “we saw someone driving out demons in Your name, and we tried to stop him, because he does not accompany us.”",
    "Luke 9:50": "“Do not stop him,” Jesus replied, “for whoever is not against you is for you.”",
    "Luke 9:51": "As the day of His ascension approached, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem.",
    "Luke 9:52": "He sent messengers on ahead, who went into a village of the Samaritans to make arrangements for Him.",
    "Luke 9:53": "But the people there refused to welcome Him, because He was heading for Jerusalem.",
    "Luke 9:54": "When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, “Lord, do You want us to call down fire from heaven to consume them?”",
    "Luke 9:55": "But Jesus turned and rebuked them.",
    "Luke 9:56": "And He and His disciples went on to another village.",
    "Luke 9:57": "As they were walking along the road, someone said to Jesus, “I will follow You wherever You go.”",
    "Luke 9:58": "Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay His head.”",
    "Luke 9:59": "Then He said to another man, “Follow Me.” The man replied, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”",
    "Luke 9:60": "But Jesus told him, “Let the dead bury their own dead. You, however, go and proclaim the kingdom of God.”",
    "Luke 9:61": "Still another said, “I will follow You, Lord; but first let me bid farewell to my family.”",
    "Luke 9:62": "Then Jesus declared, “No one who puts his hand to the plow and then looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.”",
    "Luke 10:1": "After this, the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them two by two ahead of Him to every town and place He was about to visit.",
    "Luke 10:2": "And He told them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into His harvest.",
    "Luke 10:3": "Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.",
    "Luke 10:4": "Carry no purse or bag or sandals. Do not greet anyone along the road.",
    "Luke 10:5": "Whatever house you enter, begin by saying, ‘Peace to this house.’",
    "Luke 10:6": "If a man of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; if not, it will return to you.",
    "Luke 10:7": "Stay at the same house, eating and drinking whatever you are offered. For the worker is worthy of his wages. Do not move around from house to house.",
    "Luke 10:8": "If you enter a town and they welcome you, eat whatever is set before you.",
    "Luke 10:9": "Heal the sick who are there and tell them, ‘The kingdom of God is near you.’",
    "Luke 10:10": "But if you enter a town and they do not welcome you, go into the streets and declare,",
    "Luke 10:11": "‘Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet, we wipe off as a testimony against you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God is near.’",
    "Luke 10:12": "I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town.",
    "Luke 10:13": "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.",
    "Luke 10:14": "But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.",
    "Luke 10:15": "And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades!",
    "Luke 10:16": "Whoever listens to you listens to Me; whoever rejects you rejects Me; and whoever rejects Me rejects the One who sent Me.”",
    "Luke 10:17": "The seventy-two returned with joy and said, “Lord, even the demons submit to us in Your name.”",
    "Luke 10:18": "So He told them, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.",
    "Luke 10:19": "Behold, I have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy. Nothing will harm you.",
    "Luke 10:20": "Nevertheless, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.”",
    "Luke 10:21": "At that time Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and declared, “I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was well-pleasing in Your sight.",
    "Luke 10:22": "All things have been entrusted to Me by My Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.”",
    "Luke 10:23": "Then Jesus turned to the disciples and said privately, “Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.",
    "Luke 10:24": "For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.”",
    "Luke 10:25": "One day an expert in the law stood up to test Him. “Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”",
    "Luke 10:26": "“What is written in the Law?” Jesus replied. “How do you read it?”",
    "Luke 10:27": "He answered, “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind’ and ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’”",
    "Luke 10:28": "“You have answered correctly,” Jesus said. “Do this and you will live.”",
    "Luke 10:29": "But wanting to justify himself, he asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”",
    "Luke 10:30": "Jesus took up this question and said, “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him, beat him, and went away, leaving him half dead.",
    "Luke 10:31": "Now by chance a priest was going down the same road, but when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.",
    "Luke 10:32": "So too, when a Levite came to that spot and saw him, he passed by on the other side.",
    "Luke 10:33": "But a Samaritan on a journey came upon him, and when he saw him, he had compassion.",
    "Luke 10:34": "He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.",
    "Luke 10:35": "The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Take care of him,’ he said, ‘and on my return I will repay you for any additional expense.’",
    "Luke 10:36": "Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?”",
    "Luke 10:37": "“The one who showed him mercy,” replied the expert in the law. Then Jesus told him, “Go and do likewise.”",
    "Luke 10:38": "As they traveled along, Jesus entered a village where a woman named Martha welcomed Him into her home.",
    "Luke 10:39": "She had a sister named Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet listening to His message.",
    "Luke 10:40": "But Martha was distracted by all the preparations to be made. She came to Jesus and said, “Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her to help me!”",
    "Luke 10:41": "“Martha, Martha,” the Lord replied, “you are worried and upset about many things.",
    "Luke 10:42": "But only one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion, and it will not be taken away from her.”",
    "Luke 11:1": "One day in a place where Jesus had just finished praying, one of His disciples requested, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.”",
    "Luke 11:2": "So Jesus told them, “When you pray, say: ‘Father, hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come.",
    "Luke 11:3": "Give us each day our daily bread.",
    "Luke 11:4": "And forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who sins against us. And lead us not into temptation.’”",
    "Luke 11:5": "Then Jesus said to them, “Suppose one of you goes to his friend at midnight and says, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,",
    "Luke 11:6": "because a friend of mine has come to me on a journey, and I have nothing to set before him.’",
    "Luke 11:7": "And suppose the one inside answers, ‘Do not bother me. My door is already shut, and my children and I are in bed. I cannot get up to give you anything.’",
    "Luke 11:8": "I tell you, even though he will not get up to provide for him because of his friendship, yet because of the man’s persistence, he will get up and give him as much as he needs.",
    "Luke 11:9": "So I tell you: Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.",
    "Luke 11:10": "For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.",
    "Luke 11:11": "What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead?",
    "Luke 11:12": "Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?",
    "Luke 11:13": "So if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!”",
    "Luke 11:14": "One day Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. And when the demon was gone, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowds were amazed,",
    "Luke 11:15": "but some of them said, “It is by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons, that He drives out demons.”",
    "Luke 11:16": "And others tested Him by demanding a sign from heaven.",
    "Luke 11:17": "Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself will be laid waste, and a house divided against a house will fall.",
    "Luke 11:18": "If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? After all, you say that I drive out demons by Beelzebul.",
    "Luke 11:19": "And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.",
    "Luke 11:20": "But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.",
    "Luke 11:21": "When a strong man, fully armed, guards his house, his possessions are secure.",
    "Luke 11:22": "But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armor in which the man trusted, and then he divides up his plunder.",
    "Luke 11:23": "He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters.",
    "Luke 11:24": "When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it passes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’",
    "Luke 11:25": "On its return, it finds the house swept clean and put in order.",
    "Luke 11:26": "Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and dwell there. And the final plight of that man is worse than the first.”",
    "Luke 11:27": "As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said, “Blessed is the womb that bore You, and blessed are the breasts that nursed You!”",
    "Luke 11:28": "But He replied, “Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it.”",
    "Luke 11:29": "As the crowds were increasing, Jesus said, “This is a wicked generation. It demands a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.",
    "Luke 11:30": "For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so the Son of Man will be a sign to this generation.",
    "Luke 11:31": "The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and now One greater than Solomon is here.",
    "Luke 11:32": "The men of Nineveh will stand at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now One greater than Jonah is here.",
    "Luke 11:33": "No one lights a lamp and puts it in a cellar or under a basket. Instead, he sets it on a stand, so those who enter can see the light.",
    "Luke 11:34": "Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are good, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are bad, your body is full of darkness.",
    "Luke 11:35": "Be careful, then, that the light within you is not darkness.",
    "Luke 11:36": "So if your whole body is full of light, with no part of it in darkness, you will be radiant, as though a lamp were shining on you.”",
    "Luke 11:37": "As Jesus was speaking, a Pharisee invited Him to dine with him; so He went in and reclined at the table.",
    "Luke 11:38": "But the Pharisee was surprised to see that Jesus did not first wash before the meal.",
    "Luke 11:39": "Then the Lord said, “Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.",
    "Luke 11:40": "You fools! Did not the One who made the outside make the inside as well?",
    "Luke 11:41": "But give as alms the things that are within you, and behold, everything will be clean for you.",
    "Luke 11:42": "Woe to you Pharisees! For you pay tithes of mint, rue, and every herb, but you disregard justice and the love of God. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former.",
    "Luke 11:43": "Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the chief seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces.",
    "Luke 11:44": "Woe to you! For you are like unmarked graves, which men walk over without even noticing.”",
    "Luke 11:45": "One of the experts in the law told Him, “Teacher, when You say these things, You insult us as well.”",
    "Luke 11:46": "“Woe to you as well, experts in the law!” He replied. “For you weigh men down with heavy burdens, but you yourselves will not lift a finger to lighten their load.",
    "Luke 11:47": "Woe to you! For you build tombs for the prophets, but it was your fathers who killed them.",
    "Luke 11:48": "So you are witnesses consenting to the deeds of your fathers: They killed the prophets, and you build their tombs.",
    "Luke 11:49": "Because of this, the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send them prophets and apostles; some of them they will kill and others they will persecute.’",
    "Luke 11:50": "As a result, this generation will be charged with the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the foundation of the world,",
    "Luke 11:51": "from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, all of it will be charged to this generation.",
    "Luke 11:52": "Woe to you experts in the law! For you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering.”",
    "Luke 11:53": "As Jesus went on from there, the scribes and Pharisees began to oppose Him bitterly and to ply Him with questions about many things,",
    "Luke 11:54": "waiting to catch Him in something He might say.",
    "Luke 12:1": "In the meantime, a crowd of many thousands had gathered, so that they were trampling one another. Jesus began to speak first to His disciples: “Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.",
    "Luke 12:2": "There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, and nothing hidden that will not be made known.",
    "Luke 12:3": "What you have spoken in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the housetops.",
    "Luke 12:4": "I tell you, My friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more.",

    "Luke 12:13": "Someone in the crowd said to Him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.”",
    "Luke 12:14": "But Jesus replied, “Man, who appointed Me judge or executor between you?”",
    "Luke 12:15": "And He said to them, “Watch out! Guard yourselves against every form of greed, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.”",
    "Luke 12:16": "Then He told them a parable: “The ground of a certain rich man produced an abundance.",
    "Luke 12:17": "So he thought to himself, ‘What shall I do, since I have nowhere to store my crops?’",
    "Luke 12:18": "Then he said, ‘This is what I will do: I will tear down my barns and will build bigger ones, and there I will store up all my grain and my goods.",
    "Luke 12:19": "Then I will say to myself, “You have plenty of good things laid up for many years. Take it easy. Eat, drink, and be merry!”’",
    "Luke 12:20": "But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life will be required of you. Then who will own what you have accumulated?’",
    "Luke 12:21": "This is how it will be for anyone who stores up treasure for himself but is not rich toward God.”",
    "Luke 12:22": "Then Jesus said to His disciples, “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat, or about your body, what you will wear.",
    "Luke 12:23": "For life is more than food, and the body more than clothes.",
    "Luke 12:24": "Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storehouse or barn; yet God feeds them. How much more valuable you are than the birds!",
    "Luke 12:25": "Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?",
    "Luke 12:26": "So if you cannot do such a small thing, why do you worry about the rest?",
    "Luke 12:27": "Consider how the lilies grow: They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his glory was adorned like one of these.",
    "Luke 12:28": "If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, how much more will He clothe you, O you of little faith!",
    "Luke 12:29": "And do not be concerned about what you will eat or drink. Do not worry about it.",

    "Luke 13:6": "Then Jesus told this parable: “A man had a fig tree that was planted in his vineyard. He went to look for fruit on it but did not find any.",
    "Luke 13:7": "So he said to the keeper of the vineyard, ‘Look, for the past three years I have come to search for fruit on this fig tree and haven’t found any. Therefore cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?’",
    "Luke 13:8": "‘Sir,’ the man replied, ‘leave it alone again this year, until I dig around it and fertilize it.",
    "Luke 13:9": "If it bears fruit next year, fine. But if not, you can cut it down.’”",
    "Luke 13:10": "One Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues,",
    "Luke 13:11": "and a woman there had been disabled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was hunched over and could not stand up straight.",
    "Luke 13:12": "When Jesus saw her, He called her over and said, “Woman, you are set free from your disability.”",
    "Luke 13:13": "Then He placed His hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and began to glorify God.",
    "Luke 13:14": "But the synagogue leader was indignant that Jesus had healed on the Sabbath. “There are six days for work,” he told the crowd. “So come and be healed on those days and not on the Sabbath.”",
    "Luke 13:15": "“You hypocrites!” the Lord replied. “Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the stall and lead it to water?",
    "Luke 13:16": "Then should not this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be released from her bondage on the Sabbath day?”",
    "Luke 13:17": "When Jesus said this, all His adversaries were humiliated. And the whole crowd rejoiced at all the glorious things He was doing.",
    "Luke 13:18": "Then Jesus asked, “What is the kingdom of God like? To what can I compare it?",
    "Luke 13:19": "It is like a mustard seed that a man tossed into his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air nested in its branches.”",
    "Luke 13:20": "Again He asked, “To what can I compare the kingdom of God?",
    "Luke 13:21": "It is like leaven that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour, until all of it was leavened.”",
    "Luke 13:22": "Then Jesus traveled throughout the towns and villages, teaching as He made His way toward Jerusalem.",
    "Luke 13:23": "“Lord,” someone asked Him, “will only a few people be saved?” Jesus answered,",
    "Luke 13:24": "“Make every effort to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able.",
    "Luke 13:25": "After the master of the house gets up and shuts the door, you will stand outside knocking and saying, ‘Lord, open the door for us.’ But he will reply, ‘I do not know where you are from.’",
    "Luke 13:26": "Then you will say, ‘We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.’",
    "Luke 13:27": "And he will answer, ‘I tell you, I do not know where you are from. Depart from me, all you evildoers.’",
    "Luke 13:28": "There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves are thrown out.",

    "Luke 13:31": "At that very hour, some Pharisees came to Jesus and told Him, “Leave this place and get away, because Herod wants to kill You.”",
    "Luke 13:32": "But Jesus replied, “Go tell that fox, ‘Look, I will keep driving out demons and healing people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach My goal.’",
    "Luke 13:33": "Nevertheless, I must keep going today and tomorrow and the next day, for it is not admissible for a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem.",
    "Luke 13:34": "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those sent to her, how often I have longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were unwilling!",

    "Luke 14:1": "One Sabbath, Jesus went to eat in the home of a leading Pharisee, and those in attendance were watching Him closely.",
    "Luke 14:2": "Right there before Him was a man with dropsy.",
    "Luke 14:3": "So Jesus asked the experts in the law and the Pharisees, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?”",
    "Luke 14:4": "But they remained silent. Then Jesus took hold of the man, healed him, and sent him on his way.",
    "Luke 14:5": "And He asked them, “Which of you whose son or ox falls into a pit on the Sabbath day will not immediately pull him out?”",
    "Luke 14:6": "And they were unable to answer these questions.",
    "Luke 14:7": "When Jesus noticed how the guests chose the places of honor, He told them a parable:",
    "Luke 14:8": "“When you are invited to a wedding banquet, do not sit in the place of honor, in case someone more distinguished than you has been invited.",
    "Luke 14:9": "Then the host who invited both of you will come and tell you, ‘Give this man your seat.’ And in humiliation, you will have to take the last place.",
    "Luke 14:10": "But when you are invited, go and sit in the last place, so that your host will come and tell you, ‘Friend, move up to a better place.’ Then you will be honored in front of everyone at the table with you.",
    "Luke 14:11": "For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”",
    "Luke 14:12": "Then Jesus said to the man who had invited Him, “When you host a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or brothers or relatives or rich neighbors. Otherwise, they may invite you in return, and you will be repaid.",
    "Luke 14:13": "But when you host a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind,",
    "Luke 14:14": "and you will be blessed. Since they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.”",
    "Luke 14:15": "When one of those reclining with Him heard this, he said to Jesus, “Blessed is everyone who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God.”",
    "Luke 14:16": "But Jesus replied, “A certain man prepared a great banquet and invited many guests.",
    "Luke 14:17": "When it was time for the banquet, he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited, ‘Come, for everything is now ready.’",
    "Luke 14:18": "But one after another they all began to make excuses. The first one said, ‘I have bought a field, and I need to go see it. Please excuse me.’",
    "Luke 14:19": "Another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out. Please excuse me.’",
    "Luke 14:20": "Still another said, ‘I have married a wife, so I cannot come.’",
    "Luke 14:21": "The servant returned and reported all this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and said to his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the city, and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.’",
    "Luke 14:22": "‘Sir,’ the servant replied, ‘what you ordered has been done, and there is still room.’",
    "Luke 14:23": "So the master told his servant, ‘Go out to the highways and hedges and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full.",
    "Luke 14:24": "For I tell you, not one of those men who were invited will taste my banquet.’”",
    "Luke 14:25": "Now large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and He turned and said to them,",
    "Luke 14:26": "“If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters—yes, even his own life—he cannot be My disciple.",
    "Luke 14:27": "And whoever does not carry his cross and follow Me cannot be My disciple.",
    "Luke 14:28": "Which of you, wishing to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost to see if he has the resources to complete it?",
    "Luke 14:29": "Otherwise, if he lays the foundation and is unable to finish the work, everyone who sees it will ridicule him,",
    "Luke 14:30": "saying, ‘This man could not finish what he started to build.’",
    "Luke 14:31": "Or what king on his way to war with another king will not first sit down and consider whether he can engage with ten thousand men the one coming against him with twenty thousand?",
    "Luke 14:32": "And if he is unable, he will send a delegation while the other king is still far off, to ask for terms of peace.",

    "Luke 15:15": "So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed the pigs.",
    "Luke 15:16": "He longed to fill his belly with the pods the pigs were eating, but no one would give him a thing.",
    "Luke 15:17": "Finally he came to his senses and said, ‘How many of my father’s hired servants have plenty of food, but here I am, starving to death!",

    "Luke 15:24": "For this son of mine was dead and is alive again! He was lost and is found!’ So they began to celebrate.",
    "Luke 15:25": "Meanwhile the older son was in the field, and as he approached the house, he heard music and dancing.",
    "Luke 15:26": "So he called one of the servants and asked what was going on.",
    "Luke 15:27": "‘Your brother has returned,’ he said, ‘and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has him back safe and sound.’",

    "Luke 15:31": "‘Son, you are always with me,’ the father said, ‘and all that is mine is yours.",
    "Luke 15:32": "But it was fitting to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’”",
    "Luke 16:1": "Jesus also said to His disciples, “There was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions.",
    "Luke 16:2": "So he called him in to ask, ‘What is this I hear about you? Turn in an account of your management, for you cannot be manager any longer.’",
    "Luke 16:3": "The manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do, now that my master is taking away my position? I am too weak to dig and too ashamed to beg.",
    "Luke 16:4": "I know what I will do so that after my removal from management, people will welcome me into their homes.’",
    "Luke 16:5": "And he called in each one of his master’s debtors. ‘How much do you owe my master?’ he asked the first.",
    "Luke 16:6": "‘A hundred measures of olive oil,’ he answered. ‘Take your bill,’ said the manager, ‘sit down quickly, and write fifty.’",
    "Luke 16:7": "Then he asked another, ‘And how much do you owe?’ ‘A hundred measures of wheat,’ he replied. ‘Take your bill and write eighty,’ he told him.",
    "Luke 16:8": "The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the sons of this age are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the sons of light.",

    "Luke 16:10": "Whoever is faithful with very little will also be faithful with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.",
    "Luke 16:11": "So if you have not been faithful with worldly wealth, who will entrust you with true riches?",
    "Luke 16:12": "And if you have not been faithful with the belongings of another, who will give you belongings of your own?",

    "Luke 18:36": "When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening.",
    "Luke 18:37": "“Jesus of Nazareth is passing by,” they told him.",
    "Luke 18:38": "So he called out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”",
    "Luke 18:39": "Those who led the way admonished him to be silent, but he cried out all the louder, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”",
    "Luke 18:40": "Jesus stopped and directed that the man be brought to Him. When he had come near, Jesus asked him,",
    "Luke 18:41": "“What do you want Me to do for you?” “Lord,” he said, “let me see again.”",
    "Luke 18:42": "“Receive your sight!” Jesus replied. “Your faith has healed you.”",
    "Luke 18:43": "Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.",
    "Luke 19:1": "Then Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through.",
    "Luke 19:2": "And there was a man named Zacchaeus, a chief tax collector, who was very wealthy.",
    "Luke 19:3": "He was trying to see who Jesus was, but could not see over the crowd because he was small in stature.",
    "Luke 19:4": "So he ran on ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see Him, since Jesus was about to pass that way.",
    "Luke 19:5": "When Jesus came to that place, He looked up and said, “Zacchaeus, hurry down, for I must stay at your house today.”",
    "Luke 19:6": "So Zacchaeus hurried down and welcomed Him joyfully.",
    "Luke 19:7": "And all who saw this began to grumble, saying, “He has gone to be the guest of a sinful man!”",
    "Luke 19:8": "But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord, half of my possessions I give to the poor, and if I have cheated anyone, I will repay it fourfold.”",
    "Luke 19:9": "Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because this man too is a son of Abraham.",
    "Luke 19:10": "For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”",
    "Luke 19:11": "While the people were listening to this, Jesus proceeded to tell them a parable, because He was near Jerusalem and they thought the kingdom of God would appear imminently.",
    "Luke 19:12": "So He said, “A man of noble birth went to a distant country to lay claim to his kingship and then return.",
    "Luke 19:13": "Beforehand, he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas. ‘Conduct business with this until I return,’ he said.",
    "Luke 19:14": "But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, ‘We do not want this man to rule over us.’",
    "Luke 19:15": "When he returned from procuring his kingship, he summoned the servants to whom he had given the money, to find out what each one had earned.",
    "Luke 19:16": "The first servant came forward and said, ‘Master, your mina has produced ten more minas.’",
    "Luke 19:17": "His master replied, ‘Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very small matter, you shall have authority over ten cities.’",
    "Luke 19:18": "The second servant came and said, ‘Master, your mina has made five minas.’",
    "Luke 19:19": "And to this one he said, ‘You shall have authority over five cities.’",
    "Luke 19:20": "Then another servant came and said, ‘Master, here is your mina, which I have laid away in a piece of cloth.",
    "Luke 19:21": "For I was afraid of you, because you are a harsh man. You withdraw what you did not deposit and reap what you did not sow.’",
    "Luke 19:22": "His master replied, ‘You wicked servant, I will judge you by your own words. So you knew that I am a harsh man, withdrawing what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow?",
    "Luke 19:23": "Why then did you not deposit my money in the bank, and upon my return I could have collected it with interest?’",
    "Luke 19:24": "Then he told those standing by, ‘Take the mina from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.’",
    "Luke 19:25": "‘Master,’ they said, ‘he already has ten!’",
    "Luke 19:26": "He replied, ‘I tell you that everyone who has will be given more; but the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.",
    "Luke 19:27": "And these enemies of mine who were unwilling for me to rule over them, bring them here and slay them in front of me.’”",
    "Luke 19:28": "After Jesus had said this, He went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.",
    "Luke 19:29": "As He approached Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, He sent out two of His disciples,",
    "Luke 19:30": "saying, “Go into the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here.",
    "Luke 19:31": "If anyone asks, ‘Why are you untying it?’ tell him, ‘The Lord needs it.’”",
    "Luke 19:32": "So those who were sent went out and found it just as Jesus had told them.",
    "Luke 19:33": "As they were untying the colt, its owners asked, “Why are you untying the colt?”",
    "Luke 19:34": "“The Lord needs it,” they answered.",
    "Luke 19:35": "Then they led the colt to Jesus, threw their cloaks over it, and put Jesus on it.",
    "Luke 19:36": "As He rode along, the people spread their cloaks on the road.",
    "Luke 19:37": "And as He approached the descent from the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of disciples began to praise God joyfully in a loud voice for all the miracles they had seen:",
    "Luke 19:38": "“Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord!” “Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!”",
    "Luke 19:39": "But some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Him, “Teacher, rebuke Your disciples!”",
    "Luke 19:40": "“I tell you,” He answered, “if they remain silent, the very stones will cry out.”",
    "Luke 19:41": "As Jesus approached Jerusalem and saw the city, He wept over it",
    "Luke 19:42": "and said, “If only you had known on this day what would bring you peace! But now it is hidden from your eyes.",
    "Luke 19:43": "For the days will come upon you when your enemies will barricade you and surround you and hem you in on every side.",
    "Luke 19:44": "They will level you to the ground—you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation from God.”",
    "Luke 19:45": "Then Jesus entered the temple courts and began to drive out those who were selling there.",
    "Luke 19:46": "He declared to them, “It is written: ‘My house will be a house of prayer.’ But you have made it ‘a den of robbers.’”",
    "Luke 19:47": "Jesus was teaching at the temple every day, but the chief priests, scribes, and leaders of the people were intent on killing Him.",
    "Luke 19:48": "Yet they could not find a way to do so, because all the people hung on His words.",
    "Luke 20:1": "One day as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courts and proclaiming the gospel, the chief priests and scribes, together with the elders, came up to Him.",
    "Luke 20:2": "“Tell us,” they said, “by what authority are You doing these things, and who gave You this authority?”",
    "Luke 20:3": "“I will also ask you a question,” Jesus replied. “Tell Me:",
    "Luke 20:4": "John’s baptism—was it from heaven, or from men?”",
    "Luke 20:5": "They deliberated among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will ask, ‘Why did you not believe him?’",
    "Luke 20:6": "But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.”",
    "Luke 20:7": "So they answered that they did not know where it was from.",
    "Luke 20:8": "And Jesus replied, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”",
    "Luke 20:9": "Then He proceeded to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard, rented it out to some tenants, and went away for a long time.",
    "Luke 20:10": "At harvest time, he sent a servant to the tenants to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat the servant and sent him away empty-handed.",
    "Luke 20:11": "So he sent another servant, but they beat him and treated him shamefully, sending him away empty-handed.",
    "Luke 20:12": "Then he sent a third, but they wounded him and threw him out.",
    "Luke 20:13": "‘What shall I do?’ asked the owner of the vineyard. ‘I will send my beloved son. Perhaps they will respect him.’",
    "Luke 20:14": "But when the tenants saw the son, they discussed it among themselves and said, ‘This is the heir. Let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’",
    "Luke 20:15": "So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?",
    "Luke 20:16": "He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.” And when the people heard this, they said, “May such a thing never happen!”",
    "Luke 20:17": "But Jesus looked directly at them and said, “Then what is the meaning of that which is written: ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone’?",
    "Luke 20:18": "Everyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed.”",
    "Luke 20:19": "When the scribes and chief priests realized that Jesus had spoken this parable against them, they sought to arrest Him that very hour. But they were afraid of the people.",
    "Luke 20:20": "So they watched Him closely and sent spies who pretended to be sincere. They were hoping to catch Him in His words in order to hand Him over to the rule and authority of the governor.",
    "Luke 20:21": "“Teacher,” they inquired, “we know that You speak and teach correctly. You show no partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.",
    "Luke 20:22": "Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”",
    "Luke 20:23": "But Jesus saw through their duplicity and said to them,",
    "Luke 20:24": "“Show Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?” “Caesar’s,” they answered.",
    "Luke 20:25": "So Jesus told them, “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”",
    "Luke 20:26": "And they were unable to trap Him in His words before the people. And amazed at His answer, they fell silent.",
    "Luke 20:27": "Then some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to question Him.",
    "Luke 20:28": "“Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man is to marry his brother’s widow and raise up offspring for him.",
    "Luke 20:29": "Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a wife but died childless.",
    "Luke 20:30": "Then the second",
    "Luke 20:31": "and the third married the widow, and in the same way all seven died, leaving no children.",
    "Luke 20:32": "And last of all, the woman died.",
    "Luke 20:33": "So then, in the resurrection, whose wife will she be? For all seven were married to her.”",
    "Luke 20:34": "Jesus answered, “The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage.",
    "Luke 20:35": "But those who are considered worthy to share in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage.",
    "Luke 20:36": "In fact, they can no longer die, because they are like the angels. And since they are sons of the resurrection, they are sons of God.",
    "Luke 20:37": "Even Moses demonstrates that the dead are raised, in the passage about the burning bush. For he calls the Lord ‘the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’",
    "Luke 20:38": "He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to Him all are alive.”",
    "Luke 20:39": "Some of the scribes answered, “Teacher, You have spoken well!”",
    "Luke 20:40": "And they did not dare to question Him any further.",
    "Luke 20:41": "Then Jesus declared, “How can it be said that the Christ is the Son of David?",
    "Luke 20:42": "For David himself says in the book of Psalms: ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at My right hand",
    "Luke 20:43": "until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.”’",
    "Luke 20:44": "Thus David calls Him ‘Lord.’ So how can He be David’s son?”",
    "Luke 20:45": "In the hearing of all the people, Jesus said to His disciples,",
    "Luke 20:46": "“Beware of the scribes. They like to walk around in long robes, and they love the greetings in the marketplaces, the chief seats in the synagogues, and the places of honor at banquets.",
    "Luke 20:47": "They defraud widows of their houses, and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will receive greater condemnation.”",
    "Luke 21:1": "Then Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury,",
    "Luke 21:2": "and He saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins.",
    "Luke 21:3": "“Truly I tell you,” He said, “this poor widow has put in more than all the others.",
    "Luke 21:4": "For they all contributed out of their surplus, but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to live on.”",
    "Luke 21:5": "As some of the disciples were remarking how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and consecrated gifts, Jesus said,",
    "Luke 21:6": "“As for what you see here, the time will come when not one stone will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.”",
    "Luke 21:7": "“Teacher,” they asked, “when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?”",
    "Luke 21:8": "Jesus answered, “See to it that you are not deceived. For many will come in My name, claiming, ‘I am He,’ and, ‘The time is near.’ Do not follow them.",
    "Luke 21:9": "When you hear of wars and rebellions, do not be alarmed. These things must happen first, but the end is not imminent.”",
    "Luke 21:10": "Then He told them, “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.",
    "Luke 21:11": "There will be great earthquakes, famines, and pestilences in various places, along with fearful sights and great signs from heaven.",
    "Luke 21:12": "But before all this, they will seize you and persecute you. On account of My name they will deliver you to the synagogues and prisons, and they will bring you before kings and governors.",
    "Luke 21:13": "This will be your opportunity to serve as witnesses.",
    "Luke 21:14": "So make up your mind not to worry beforehand how to defend yourselves.",
    "Luke 21:15": "For I will give you speech and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.",
    "Luke 21:16": "You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and some of you will be put to death.",
    "Luke 21:17": "And you will be hated by everyone because of My name.",
    "Luke 21:18": "Yet not even a hair of your head will perish.",
    "Luke 21:19": "By your patient endurance you will gain your souls.",
    "Luke 21:20": "But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, you will know that her desolation is near.",
    "Luke 21:21": "Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let those in the country stay out of the city.",
    "Luke 21:22": "For these are the days of vengeance, to fulfill all that is written.",
    "Luke 21:23": "How miserable those days will be for pregnant and nursing mothers! For there will be great distress upon the land and wrath against this people.",
    "Luke 21:24": "They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive into all the nations. And Jerusalem will be trodden down by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.",
    "Luke 21:25": "There will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and on the earth dismay among the nations, bewildered by the roaring of the sea and the surging of the waves.",
    "Luke 21:26": "Men will faint from fear and anxiety over what is coming upon the earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.",
    "Luke 21:27": "At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.",
    "Luke 21:28": "When these things begin to happen, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.”",
    "Luke 21:29": "Then Jesus told them a parable: “Look at the fig tree and all the trees.",
    "Luke 21:30": "When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near.",
    "Luke 21:31": "So also, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.",
    "Luke 21:32": "Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have happened.",
    "Luke 21:33": "Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away.",
    "Luke 21:34": "But watch yourselves, or your hearts will be weighed down by dissipation, drunkenness, and the worries of life—and that day will spring upon you suddenly like a snare.",

    "Luke 21:36": "So keep watch at all times, and pray that you may have the strength to escape all that is about to happen and to stand before the Son of Man.”",
    "Luke 21:37": "Every day Jesus taught at the temple, but every evening He went out to spend the night on the Mount of Olives.",
    "Luke 21:38": "And early in the morning all the people would come to hear Him at the temple.",
    "Luke 22:1": "Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching,",
    "Luke 22:2": "and the chief priests and scribes were looking for a way to put Jesus to death, for they feared the people.",
    "Luke 22:3": "Then Satan entered Judas Iscariot, who was one of the Twelve.",
    "Luke 22:4": "And Judas went to discuss with the chief priests and temple officers how he might betray Jesus to them.",
    "Luke 22:5": "They were delighted and agreed to give him money.",
    "Luke 22:6": "Judas consented, and began to look for an opportunity to betray Jesus to them in the absence of a crowd.",
    "Luke 22:7": "Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed.",
    "Luke 22:8": "Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.”",
    "Luke 22:9": "“Where do You want us to prepare it?” they asked.",
    "Luke 22:10": "He answered, “When you enter the city, a man carrying a jug of water will meet you. Follow him to the house he enters,",
    "Luke 22:11": "and say to the owner of that house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?’",
    "Luke 22:12": "And he will show you a large upper room, already furnished. Make preparations there.”",
    "Luke 22:13": "So they went and found it just as Jesus had told them. And they prepared the Passover.",
    "Luke 22:14": "When the hour had come, Jesus reclined at the table with His apostles.",
    "Luke 22:15": "And He said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before My suffering.",

    "Luke 22:20": "In the same way, after supper He took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is poured out for you.",
    "Luke 22:21": "Look! The hand of My betrayer is with Mine on the table.",
    "Luke 22:22": "Indeed, the Son of Man will go as it has been determined, but woe to that man who betrays Him.”",
    "Luke 22:23": "Then they began to question among themselves which of them was going to do this.",
    "Luke 22:24": "A dispute also arose among the disciples as to which of them should be considered the greatest.",
    "Luke 22:25": "So Jesus declared, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in authority over them call themselves benefactors.",
    "Luke 22:26": "But you shall not be like them. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves.",
    "Luke 22:27": "For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines? But I am among you as one who serves.",
    "Luke 22:28": "You are the ones who have stood by Me in My trials.",
    "Luke 22:29": "And I bestow on you a kingdom, just as My Father has bestowed one on Me,",
    "Luke 22:30": "so that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.",

    "Luke 22:33": "“Lord,” said Peter, “I am ready to go with You even to prison and to death.”",
    "Luke 22:34": "But Jesus replied, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me.”",
    "Luke 22:35": "Then Jesus asked them, “When I sent you out without purse or bag or sandals, did you lack anything?” “Nothing,” they answered.",
    "Luke 22:36": "“Now, however,” He told them, “the one with a purse should take it, and likewise a bag; and the one without a sword should sell his cloak and buy one.",
    "Luke 22:37": "For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in Me: ‘And He was numbered with the transgressors.’ For what is written about Me is reaching its fulfillment.”",
    "Luke 22:38": "So they said, “Look, Lord, here are two swords.” “That is enough,” He answered.",
    "Luke 22:39": "Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed Him.",
    "Luke 22:40": "When He came to the place, He told them, “Pray that you will not enter into temptation.”",
    "Luke 22:41": "And He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, where He knelt down and prayed,",
    "Luke 22:42": "“Father, if You are willing, take this cup from Me. Yet not My will, but Yours be done.”",

    "Luke 22:44": "And in His anguish, He prayed more earnestly, and His sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground.",
    "Luke 22:45": "When Jesus rose from prayer and returned to the disciples, He found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.",
    "Luke 22:46": "“Why are you sleeping?” He asked. “Get up and pray so that you will not enter into temptation.”",
    "Luke 22:47": "While He was still speaking, a crowd arrived, led by the man called Judas, one of the Twelve. He approached Jesus to kiss Him.",
    "Luke 22:48": "But Jesus asked him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”",
    "Luke 22:49": "Those around Jesus saw what was about to happen and said, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?”",
    "Luke 22:50": "And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.",
    "Luke 22:51": "But Jesus answered, “No more of this!” And He touched the man’s ear and healed him.",
    "Luke 22:52": "Then Jesus said to the chief priests, temple officers, and elders who had come for Him, “Have you come out with swords and clubs as you would against an outlaw?",
    "Luke 22:53": "Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on Me. But this hour belongs to you and to the power of darkness.”",

    "Luke 22:59": "About an hour later, another man insisted, “Certainly this man was with Him, for he too is a Galilean.”",
    "Luke 22:60": "“Man, I do not know what you are talking about,” Peter replied. And immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.",
    "Luke 22:61": "And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word that the Lord had spoken to him: “Before the rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times.”",
